        "This implementation is up to 4 times faster than openai/whisper for the same accuracy while using less memory. The efficiency can be further improved with 8-bit quantization on both CPU and GPU.\n",

            "[00:01:14,590 --> 00:01:40,220]  For our first quarter, 2009, you can see that our revenue number is roughly $16.8 billion,\n",
            "[00:01:40,220 --> 00:01:46,220]  which primarily means that we met our first quarter guidance, not only in terms of revenue,\n",
            "[00:01:46,220 --> 00:02:04,100]  but actually also in terms of operating income, and slightly short non-operating items.\n",
            "[00:02:04,100 --> 00:02:14,350]  These occurred a little bit earlier.\n",
            "[00:02:14,350 --> 00:02:27,590]  We were able to meet our performance primarily due to better-than-expected HPG performance.\n",
            "[00:02:27,590 --> 00:02:32,590]  Despite the revenue pressure, our first quarter EBITDA achieved the guidance,\n",
            "[00:02:32,590 --> 00:02:40,590]  due primarily to market expense savings of selling expenses plus mobile device subsidies,\n",
            "[00:02:40,590 --> 00:02:44,590]  netted 17.7% of total revenue.\n",
            "[00:02:44,590 --> 00:02:55,780]  First quarter 2009, which is a reduction, 18.71% reduction from fourth quarter last year.\n",

            "[00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:06,440]  and the completeness was a little bit ahead of the schedule,\n",
            "[00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:12,130]  asset write-off exceeded our guidance.\n",
            "[00:03:12,130 --> 00:03:26,930]  This is basically briefly described.\n",
            "[00:03:26,930 --> 00:03:41,410]  And then if you go to the next page, which gives you a little bit of a breakdown of our performance of different business groups.\n",

            "[00:03:57,220 --> 00:04:02,220]  So our consolidated revenue decreased roughly 2% from a year ago.\n",

            "[00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:23,910]  And our enterprise EBITDA in first quarter did not increase along with the growth in revenue\n",
            "[00:04:23,910 --> 00:04:28,910]  because we had higher percentage of revenue coming from lower margin.\n",
            "[00:04:28,910 --> 00:04:41,170]  As to the household business, it showed a healthy 6% year-over-year growth.\n",

            "[00:04:49,460 --> 00:04:57,680]  it was not negatively affected.\n",
            "[00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:04,990]  In the next page, we will give you a comparison of our peers.\n",
            "[00:05:04,990 --> 00:05:16,630]  As you can see that our mobile subscriber number grew 1.9% on year-over-year growth,\n",

            "[00:05:25,460 --> 00:05:32,490]  we stood out in terms of mobile EBITDA margin and the total subscriber number.\n",

            "[00:05:57,740 --> 00:06:04,090]  This is primarily related by the 68% revenue increase in mobile Internet.\n",
            "[00:06:04,090 --> 00:06:08,090]  The strong growth in mobile Internet revenue was combined.\n",

            "[00:08:26,420 --> 00:08:33,420]  In terms of financing activities, we repaid syndicate loan of 5.2 billion as I just mentioned\n",

            "[00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:46,840]  This is net of treasury shares held by our subsidiaries and the shares bought from the market.\n",
            "[00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:54,410]  And then for new product and services, we are ahead of the pack\n",
            "[00:10:54,410 --> 00:11:01,410]  and we launched our own brand netbooks early this year.\n",

            "[00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:47,100]  And then we also received seven commendations from NCC\n",
            "[00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:54,100]  to which we have the most among our peers for the effort of bridging digital gap\n",
            "[00:12:54,100 --> 00:13:00,520]  in some of the remote areas in Taiwan.\n",
            "[00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:05,520]  Just to reaffirm that on March 18th NCC announced\n",
            "[00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:09,520]  to require SOs to provide performance guarantee\n",
            "[00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:16,970]  on the advance received from cable TV customers.\n",
            "[00:13:16,970 --> 00:13:25,060]  This new regulation is expected to take effect starting next year.\n",
            "[00:13:25,060 --> 00:13:30,980]  But this is not really very significant.\n",
            "[00:13:31,980 --> 00:13:40,980]  Our key message for this quarter is that although we continue facing\n",
            "[00:13:40,980 --> 00:13:50,960]  the worldwide financial turmoil and depressed economy,\n",
            "[00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:54,960]  due to the weakness of the economy as a reflection\n",
            "[00:13:54,960 --> 00:14:00,960]  that we inevitably posted a decline in the first quarter.\n",
            "[00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:03,960]  However, we are still able to meet our guidance.\n",
            "[00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:10,270]  And looking ahead, the economic outlook remains bleak.\n",
            "[00:14:10,270 --> 00:14:13,270]  Taiwan Mobile will strive to sustain our EBITDA level\n",

            "[00:14:17,620 --> 00:14:22,550]  And with that, I think we'll be happy to take questions.\n",
            "[00:14:22,550 --> 00:14:34,610]  We can start our Q&A session.\n",

            "[00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:38,560]  We will now poll for questions.\n",

            "[00:14:58,290 --> 00:15:02,290]  This is Anand Ramachandran calling from Citigroup in Hong Kong.\n",
            "[00:15:02,290 --> 00:15:05,290]  I had two questions.\n",
            "[00:15:05,290 --> 00:15:08,290]  Firstly, and I guess you probably expect this,\n",
            "[00:15:08,290 --> 00:15:11,290]  I was wondering if what your perspective was\n",
            "[00:15:11,290 --> 00:15:16,290]  into the China Mobile investment into Far East Zone yesterday.\n",
            "[00:15:16,290 --> 00:15:18,290]  And the second part to that question,\n",
            "[00:15:18,290 --> 00:15:21,290]  how do you see that impacting Taiwan Mobile at all,\n",
            "[00:15:21,290 --> 00:15:23,290]  either in terms of opportunity\n",
            "[00:15:23,290 --> 00:15:27,290]  or in terms of threats on a 12-month view?\n",
            "[00:15:27,290 --> 00:15:29,290]  So that's question number one.\n",
            "[00:15:29,290 --> 00:15:35,290]  Question two, you have indicated second quarter estimates.\n",
            "[00:15:35,290 --> 00:15:38,290]  Can I take that to mean that the full year estimates\n",
            "[00:15:38,290 --> 00:15:42,290]  that you gave out back with the fourth quarter results for 2009,\n",
            "[00:15:42,290 --> 00:15:44,290]  those still stay the way they are?\n",
            "[00:15:44,290 --> 00:15:45,290]  Those stay unchanged?\n",
            "[00:15:45,290 --> 00:15:49,020]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:15:49,020 --> 00:15:51,020]  And I will answer your first question.\n",
            "[00:15:51,020 --> 00:15:55,020]  I will let Ruthie answer your second question.\n",
            "[00:15:55,020 --> 00:16:02,020]  Well, it is a surprise to us to see that announcement made\n",
            "[00:16:02,020 --> 00:16:07,890]  both by Far East Zone as well as by China Mobile.\n",
            "[00:16:07,890 --> 00:16:11,300]  However, first of all,\n",
            "[00:16:11,300 --> 00:16:15,300]  I think that they still have to meet some regulatory challenges.\n",
            "[00:16:15,300 --> 00:16:25,590]  I think right now our understanding that this media,\n",
            "[00:16:25,590 --> 00:16:36,160]  and secondly, from the limited information we have,\n",
            "[00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:46,230]  we do not see that much of an impact on the economy landscape.\n",

            "[00:16:50,700 --> 00:16:52,700]  I mean, I don't know if this is answerable.\n",
            "[00:16:52,700 --> 00:16:55,700]  Were you involved in any discussion with any Chinese cell phones\n",
            "[00:16:55,700 --> 00:16:57,700]  at any point in time at all?\n",
            "[00:16:57,700 --> 00:17:08,660]  Excuse me.\n",
            "[00:17:08,660 --> 00:17:14,660]  I have not spoken to anybody from China Mobile for maybe a year.\n",
            "[00:17:14,660 --> 00:17:15,660]  I don't know.\n",
            "[00:17:15,660 --> 00:17:17,660]  Quite a long time.\n",
            "[00:17:17,660 --> 00:17:19,820]  Okay.\n",
            "[00:17:19,820 --> 00:17:21,820]  And Anand, to answer your second question,\n",
            "[00:17:21,820 --> 00:17:23,820]  our original guidance still holds.\n",
            "[00:17:23,820 --> 00:17:29,940]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:17:29,940 --> 00:17:37,170]  Our next question comes from Kim Starway of J.P. Morgan.\n",
            "[00:17:37,170 --> 00:17:40,420]  Sorry, J.P. Morgan.\n",
            "[00:17:40,420 --> 00:17:42,420]  Just a question on CapEx.\n",
            "[00:17:42,420 --> 00:17:46,420]  Given the trends you indicated earlier on the success of products\n",
            "[00:17:46,420 --> 00:17:50,420]  like the mobile internet, netbooks,\n",
            "[00:17:50,420 --> 00:17:54,420]  these are obviously more bandwidth-hungry stories.\n",
            "[00:17:54,420 --> 00:17:57,420]  I'm just curious about your thoughts on CapEx\n",
            "[00:17:57,420 --> 00:18:00,420]  in light of the need to continue to provide more and more capacity\n",
            "[00:18:00,420 --> 00:18:02,420]  for those types of services\n",
            "[00:18:02,420 --> 00:18:06,420]  and how you see the match between perhaps the economic environment\n",
            "[00:18:06,420 --> 00:18:09,420]  encouraging you to curtail CapEx\n",
            "[00:18:09,420 --> 00:18:14,420]  but the demand environment from consumers on these data services\n",
            "[00:18:14,420 --> 00:18:24,990]  to require investments remain high and not increasing.\n",
            "[00:18:24,990 --> 00:18:33,990]  We have already turned down our CapEx from $8.4 billion last year to $6.9 billion,\n",
            "[00:18:33,990 --> 00:18:40,990]  and currently we have slightly reduced it down to $6.5 billion.\n",
            "[00:18:40,990 --> 00:18:54,280]  So that has already reflected our determination to cope with financial weakness in the economy.\n",
            "[00:18:54,280 --> 00:19:00,280]  And you're not worried that the increase in demand as the supply of more\n",
            "[00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:06,280]  and more affordable netbook and smartphone products from electronic vendors\n",
            "[00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:12,280]  will make it possible for people to be using more and more mobile internet applications\n",
            "[00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:16,280]  that you might be under-investing, say, over the next one or two years\n",
            "[00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:20,280]  in that context of the lower CapEx you're now looking at?\n",
            "[00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:24,280]  No, we don't think that will cause that effect.\n",
            "[00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:27,280]  Okay. Thank you very much for that.\n",
            "[00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:35,280]  Just a follow-up on the announcement yesterday between China Mobile and Far Eastone.\n",
            "[00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:40,280]  What's obviously also interesting is the money that Far Eastone is getting.\n",
            "[00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:47,280]  They have basically indicated it's going to be earmarked in a sort of venture capital approach\n",
            "[00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:51,280]  to investing in perhaps internet-related companies and content companies,\n",
            "[00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:54,280]  perhaps in Taiwan but more likely in China.\n",
            "[00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:58,280]  I'm just curious, assuming this goes forward, on the one hand,\n",
            "[00:19:58,280 --> 00:20:02,280]  the possibility of you having a Chinese strategic partner is there,\n",
            "[00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:05,280]  but on the other hand, the other interesting thing that I'd love to get your insight on\n",
            "[00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:12,280]  is whether or not you think there's a story to be focusing more on investing\n",
            "[00:20:12,280 --> 00:20:19,280]  in the value-added services chain similar to what Far Eastone is talking about now\n",
            "[00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:22,280]  and perhaps more similar to what Telstra has already done\n",
            "[00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:25,280]  with the internet investments they've made in China over the last year or two.\n",
            "[00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:28,280]  Any comments on that kind of strategy?\n",
            "[00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:31,280]  Well, I wish them all the best of luck.\n",
            "[00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:35,280]  Okay. It's not something that's interesting.\n",
            "[00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:37,280]  Taiwan Mobile just wants to stick to being a mobile operator in Taiwan.\n",
            "[00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:40,280]  Is that basically what I should take away from this?\n",
            "[00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:42,280]  No, that's not what you should take away.\n",
            "[00:20:42,280 --> 00:20:47,280]  I only said that I wish them to be the best of luck. That's all I said.\n",
            "[00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:52,280]  We had a small operation in Beijing already, I think, for a couple of years.\n",
            "[00:20:52,280 --> 00:20:58,280]  We did not sort of give up the China market,\n",
            "[00:20:58,280 --> 00:21:06,760]  but making investments in China is a challenge.\n",
            "[00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:11,760]  I don't think that you people will be pleased that we tell you\n",
            "[00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:19,480]  that we're going to set aside $20 billion for making investments.\n",
            "[00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:22,480]  Okay. I understand perfectly. Thank you. Thank you very much for that.\n",
            "[00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:30,390]  Thank you. Next question comes from Alpha of LBS.\n",
            "[00:21:30,390 --> 00:21:34,060]  Hi. Thanks for the call. I have two questions.\n",
            "[00:21:34,060 --> 00:21:38,060]  Firstly, with regard to the asset right now, just for clarification,\n",
            "[00:21:38,060 --> 00:21:42,060]  is this merely a front-loading of your full-year guidance,\n",
            "[00:21:42,060 --> 00:21:45,060]  or will this mean an increase going forward?\n",
            "[00:21:45,060 --> 00:21:51,060]  Second question I have is with regard to your 2Q09 guidance.\n",
            "[00:21:51,060 --> 00:21:54,060]  It seems to me that Taiwan Mobile is quite unique\n",
            "[00:21:54,060 --> 00:21:58,060]  in saying it's posting sequential earnings growth and margin expansion.\n",
            "[00:21:58,060 --> 00:22:01,060]  What do you think will allow you to do this,\n",
            "[00:22:01,060 --> 00:22:05,060]  and what are you doing differently from your peers in order to achieve this?\n",
            "[00:22:05,060 --> 00:22:15,140]  To answer your first question,\n",
            "[00:22:15,140 --> 00:22:22,140]  we don't think our write-off amount for the full year will exceed our guidance.\n",
            "[00:22:22,140 --> 00:22:25,140]  That's based on our current estimate.\n",
            "[00:22:25,140 --> 00:22:43,540]  As to your second question, I think our focus is mainly on the EBITDA.\n",
            "[00:22:43,540 --> 00:22:46,540]  So as Harvey mentioned earlier,\n",
            "[00:22:46,540 --> 00:22:55,540]  we will try to exercise discipline over spending in the second quarter\n",
            "[00:22:55,540 --> 00:23:03,620]  as implemented in the third quarter to achieve the goal.\n",
            "[00:23:03,620 --> 00:23:06,620]  And you don't feel that there will be competitive pressures out there\n",
            "[00:23:06,620 --> 00:23:10,620]  which will actually require you to spend more going forward\n",
            "[00:23:10,620 --> 00:23:14,360]  as compared to the first quarter levels?\n",
            "[00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:21,580]  Well, the competition is a very dynamic game.\n",
            "[00:23:21,580 --> 00:23:23,580]  Given what we have seen so far,\n",
            "[00:23:23,580 --> 00:23:27,580]  we think that we are giving a reasonable estimate.\n",
            "[00:23:27,580 --> 00:23:30,580]  Come on, it's only two and a half months away.\n",
            "[00:23:30,580 --> 00:23:33,580]  We are not telling you this is going to happen three years later.\n",
            "[00:23:33,580 --> 00:23:37,580]  Whether this is going to come true or not, you will know very shortly.\n",
            "[00:23:37,580 --> 00:23:41,930]  So I don't think you have that much to worry about.\n",
            "[00:23:41,930 --> 00:23:43,930]  We will announce our monthly results.\n",
            "[00:23:43,930 --> 00:23:52,080]  Okay, got it. Thank you very much.\n",
            "[00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:58,460]  Thank you. Our next question comes from Kathy Chen of Goldman Sachs.\n",
            "[00:23:58,460 --> 00:24:00,460]  Hi, thanks for the call.\n",
            "[00:24:00,460 --> 00:24:05,460]  I have a two-part question related to the cable business.\n",
            "[00:24:05,460 --> 00:24:09,460]  Firstly, can you talk a bit more about the digital TV rollout\n",
            "[00:24:09,460 --> 00:24:12,460]  and what impact on financials that will have,\n",
            "[00:24:12,460 --> 00:24:15,460]  including color on what the pricing looks like\n",
            "[00:24:15,460 --> 00:24:18,460]  compared to the basic analog cable,\n",
            "[00:24:18,460 --> 00:24:22,460]  and then what kind of set-top box subsidies are being provided?\n",
            "[00:24:22,460 --> 00:24:27,460]  Secondly, regarding some recent news flow that NCC may establish rules\n",
            "[00:24:27,460 --> 00:24:29,460]  requiring channel operators to provide the same program\n",
            "[00:24:29,460 --> 00:24:32,460]  on both cable and Chunghwa's MOD platform,\n",
            "[00:24:32,460 --> 00:24:36,460]  what is your view on this potential impact to your cable business\n",
            "[00:24:36,460 --> 00:24:38,460]  as well as to the overall cable industry?\n",
            "[00:24:38,460 --> 00:24:54,450]  Thanks.\n",
            "[00:24:54,450 --> 00:25:04,450]  Kathy, the digital TV rollout, I think, is a new attempt.\n",
            "[00:25:04,450 --> 00:25:15,450]  I think that each of the MSOs are now in the process of lining up their content.\n",
            "[00:25:15,450 --> 00:25:23,460]  We don't want to be behind, so we also want to join the crowd.\n",
            "[00:25:23,460 --> 00:25:33,940]  But the initial subscription, I think, maybe 10,000 to 20,000 subscribers\n",
            "[00:25:33,940 --> 00:25:38,040]  in the first three to six months is not a whole lot.\n",
            "[00:25:38,040 --> 00:25:47,800]  So financially, I really don't see any significant impact one way or another.\n",
            "[00:25:47,800 --> 00:26:03,380]  As to the PRC companies making investments here in Taiwan in the area of cable TV,\n",
            "[00:26:03,380 --> 00:26:05,380]  I think it will take a while.\n",
            "[00:26:05,380 --> 00:26:11,300]  I think it's not going to be that easy.\n",
            "[00:26:11,300 --> 00:26:16,650]  Again, I think there will be some regulatory constraints.\n",
            "[00:26:16,650 --> 00:26:35,480]  So for the time being, I really don't worry that much about it.\n",
            "[00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:39,620]  Actually, sorry, just to clarify.\n",
            "[00:26:39,620 --> 00:26:43,620]  My second question was actually related to some recent news flow\n",
            "[00:26:43,620 --> 00:26:49,620]  where NCC is looking to establish rules where content has to be the same\n",
            "[00:26:49,620 --> 00:26:55,620]  on both the cable TV platform as well as Chunghwa's IPTV platform.\n",
            "[00:26:55,620 --> 00:27:15,620]  Kathy, could you please clarify your question?\n",
            "[00:27:16,620 --> 00:27:17,620]  Yeah.\n",
            "[00:27:17,620 --> 00:27:21,620]  It was basically just some news flow saying that the NCC, in response to, I guess,\n",
            "[00:27:21,620 --> 00:27:26,620]  customer complaints that the content on Chunghwa's MOD platform is different\n",
            "[00:27:26,620 --> 00:27:29,620]  from what's being offered on the cable side.\n",
            "[00:27:29,620 --> 00:27:33,620]  I think NCC made some statements saying that they may establish a rule\n",
            "[00:27:33,620 --> 00:27:36,620]  where the content has to be the same or something along those lines.\n",
            "[00:27:36,620 --> 00:27:37,620]  I never heard that before.\n",
            "[00:27:37,620 --> 00:27:44,420]  I think that's ‚Äì I don't think that NCC would want to get involved in that.\n",
            "[00:27:44,420 --> 00:27:45,420]  Okay.\n",
            "[00:27:45,420 --> 00:27:48,420]  Actually, can I just ask a follow-up on the first part?\n",
            "[00:27:48,420 --> 00:27:54,420]  So just to clarify, for digital offerings now, is the ARPU also tapped\n",
            "[00:27:54,420 --> 00:27:58,420]  or do you have, like, all our cart packages you can offer?\n",
            "[00:27:58,420 --> 00:28:02,420]  And then is it still the first set-top box is being fully subsidized?\n",
            "[00:28:02,420 --> 00:28:05,420]  No, it will not be fully subsidized.\n",
            "[00:28:05,420 --> 00:28:14,420]  I think that right now that we are ‚Äì the digital content is treated as\n",
            "[00:28:14,420 --> 00:28:18,420]  value-added services of the cable TV.\n",
            "[00:28:18,420 --> 00:28:26,370]  So there will be additional charges on that.\n",
            "[00:28:26,370 --> 00:28:31,590]  There will be additional revenues, I think, from the digital content.\n",
            "[00:28:31,590 --> 00:28:41,650]  We are in no position to offer that for free or to subsidize that heavily.\n",
            "[00:28:41,650 --> 00:28:42,940]  Okay, great.\n",
            "[00:28:42,940 --> 00:28:46,540]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:28:46,540 --> 00:28:49,540]  Thank you once again.\n",
            "[00:28:49,540 --> 00:28:51,540]  If you wish to register for a question,\n",
            "[00:28:51,540 --> 00:29:05,300]  please press the number one key on the telephone touchpad.\n",
            "[00:29:05,300 --> 00:29:12,190]  Excuse me, Mr. Zhang, there is no further question at this point in time.\n",
            "[00:29:12,190 --> 00:29:18,190]  Okay, thank you all very much for attending this call.\n",
            "[00:29:18,190 --> 00:29:21,190]  We will talk to you again next quarter.\n",
            "[00:29:21,190 --> 00:29:23,190]  Have a very good afternoon.\n",

            "[00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:09,000]  Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to the conference call. Our chat person today is Mr. Jamie Lin. Mr. Lin, please begin your call and may be standing by for the Q&A. Thank you.\n",
            "[00:00:10,860 --> 00:00:17,860]  Thank you, Operator. Good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to Taobao Mobile's fourth quarter 2021 earnings conference call.\n",

            "[00:01:06,430 --> 00:01:13,430]  Alright, now that's out of the way, let's start with the business overview. Please turn to page 4 for 2021 highlights.\n",
            "[00:01:14,430 --> 00:01:26,780]  In 2021, all three of our main growth engines pumped on all cylinders and delivered solid top-line expansion,\n",
            "[00:01:26,780 --> 00:01:32,780]  resulting in a 17% year-over-year increase in our 2021 consolidated revenue.\n",
            "[00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:44,230]  Thanks to our pool recovery through successful upselling, mobile service revenue increased YOY, the first time since 2016.\n",
            "[00:01:45,580 --> 00:01:52,580]  Despite an already high base, our e-commerce business delivered a 35% revenue surge in 2021.\n",
            "[00:01:52,580 --> 00:02:04,030]  As for our home broadband business, its revenue growth further expanded to 13% amid COVID-induced demand and excellent traction of our DoublePlay packages.\n",
            "[00:02:05,030 --> 00:02:14,960]  Underpinned by the top-line expansions we just mentioned, 2021 consolidated EBITDA turned to a 6% YOY growth,\n",
            "[00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:23,060]  exceeding the guidance we gave, that is flat to slightly down by a wide margin.\n",
            "[00:02:25,180 --> 00:02:29,180]  Next, let's turn to page 5 for a closer look at our mobile business.\n",
            "[00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:43,930]  For Taiwan Mobile, 5G penetration more than doubled during 2021, at the same time lifting monthly fee by 26% for those customers that have upgraded.\n",
            "[00:02:44,930 --> 00:02:53,630]  As a result, mobile and telecom service revenues both turned to YOY growth for the fourth year.\n",
            "[00:02:53,630 --> 00:03:02,980]  The upselling was achieved through the bundling of premium handsets such as the iPhone 13 and Google Pixel 6 series,\n",
            "[00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:18,500]  with the focus on 48-month plans, as well as our unique DoublePlay, or in Chinese, Hao Su Chen Shuang, and Mobile, or in Chinese, Mo Bi Duo packages.\n",
            "[00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:33,330]  Close to 60% of our DoublePlay subs were for 999 or higher rate plans by the end of 2021, and our coverage footprint was over 70% of Taiwan's households.\n",
            "[00:03:34,810 --> 00:03:46,840]  In addition, Mo Mobile users' contribution to MoMo's e-commerce revenue reached 1.9% in December, a significant increase from the 0.4% a year ago.\n",
            "[00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:55,380]  Meanwhile, carrying Disney Plus as the exclusive telecom operator partner provided solid traction to our mobile business.\n",
            "[00:03:56,380 --> 00:04:04,610]  We expect it to continue to help us promote premium rate plans, increase customer stickiness, and create cross-selling opportunities.\n",
            "[00:04:05,610 --> 00:04:11,540]  Finally, our customers continue to love our ability to offer them better products and services,\n",
            "[00:04:12,540 --> 00:04:23,540]  and as a result, post-pay monthly churn has further declined by 9 basis points to a historical low of 0.87% in 2021.\n",
            "[00:04:24,540 --> 00:04:30,950]  As we enhance our lineup of products and services to offer unique values to different market segments,\n",
            "[00:04:31,950 --> 00:04:40,980]  as well as continue to focus on 48-month contracts, we expect our growth momentum to continue and churn rate to remain low going forward.\n",
            "[00:04:41,980 --> 00:04:47,910]  Now let's turn to page 6 for an update on our e-commerce business.\n",
            "[00:04:52,910 --> 00:05:00,940]  As the leading e-commerce platform in Taiwan, MoMo delivered stellar results during the annual Double Eleven Shopping Festival,\n",
            "[00:05:01,940 --> 00:05:06,940]  with its e-commerce revenue reaching a historical high in the fourth quarter.\n",
            "[00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:16,300]  For the full year, revenue grew 35% for the second year in a row, as customer number and stickiness continued to increase.\n",
            "[00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:25,030]  Thanks to economies of scale and operating leverage, MoMo's e-commerce EBITDA soared by 80% y-of-y,\n",
            "[00:05:26,030 --> 00:05:34,030]  translating to 128 basis points of margin expansion to 5.2% in 2021.\n",
            "[00:05:35,030 --> 00:05:42,320]  On the logistics side, five more satellite warehouses were added in the fourth quarter, bringing the total number to 30.\n",
            "[00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:45,320]  That's eight more than a year ago.\n",
            "[00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:55,350]  In addition to the ongoing construction of the Southern Distribution Center, we secured land for the Central Distribution Center as well.\n",
            "[00:05:56,350 --> 00:06:03,350]  Coupled with the continuous build-out of the satellite warehouse network and in-house delivery fleet,\n",
            "[00:06:04,350 --> 00:06:08,510]  MoMo is well positioned to continue outperforming its peers.\n",
            "[00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:13,500]  Now let's take a look at our broadband business on the next page.\n",
            "[00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:25,070]  In the fourth quarter, we continued to outperform our MSO peers in the y-of-y trends of basic TV subscriptions and broadband service penetration.\n",
            "[00:06:26,070 --> 00:06:33,810]  Sustained demand for faster home broadband led to sequential increases in broadband subs and ARPU throughout the year.\n",
            "[00:06:34,810 --> 00:06:44,940]  This resulted in a 13% y-of-y increase in broadband revenue in 2021, where Double Play was a significant contributor to growth.\n",
            "[00:06:45,940 --> 00:06:56,990]  Broadband strength also helped CATV revenue and EBITDA both turn to y-of-y growth for the full year, the first time since 2015.\n",
            "[00:06:57,990 --> 00:07:02,300]  Now let me turn the presentation over to Rosy for financial overview.\n",
            "[00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:11,410]  Hi, good afternoon. Let's start with performance by business.\n",
            "[00:07:12,410 --> 00:07:21,020]  In the fourth quarter of 2021, consolidated revenue grew by 17% on a year-on-year basis.\n",
            "[00:07:22,050 --> 00:07:26,050]  Supported by robust e-commerce business and improving telecom business.\n",
            "[00:07:27,460 --> 00:07:36,460]  Mobile service revenue grew year-on-year with steady ARPU improvement, resulting in a 2% telecom revenue growth in the quarter.\n",
            "[00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:46,200]  Thanks to increasing revenues, well-managed marketing costs and the government subsidies for 5G network construction,\n",
            "[00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:53,200]  telecom EBITDA rose year-on-year, marking the third consecutive quarter of year-on-year growth.\n",
            "[00:07:54,740 --> 00:08:03,740]  Momo continued on its growth, bolstered by e-commerce, where its revenue grew by 33% y-of-y in the quarter.\n",
            "[00:08:04,970 --> 00:08:14,970]  Despite higher marketing expenses associated with the Double 11 Shopping Festival, EBITDA surged by 44% y-of-y,\n",
            "[00:08:14,970 --> 00:08:18,970]  thanks to economies of scale and operating leverage.\n",
            "[00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:28,540]  Cable TV EBITDA increased by 3% y-of-y in the fourth quarter, underpinned by solid broadband revenue momentum.\n",
            "[00:08:30,470 --> 00:08:32,470]  So now let's go to result summary.\n",
            "[00:08:33,470 --> 00:08:44,680]  In the fourth quarter, besides solid top-line growth, telecom and cable TV EBITDA continued to see y-of-y hype,\n",
            "[00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:50,680]  while Momo remained a key contributor to the y-of-y rise in consolidated EBITDA.\n",
            "[00:08:52,030 --> 00:09:01,030]  As 5G DNA's impact on telecom profitability started subsiding, 5G upselling and Momo's upbeat performance helped\n",
            "[00:09:02,030 --> 00:09:08,990]  consolidated operating income grow 9% y-of-y in the fourth quarter.\n",
            "[00:09:08,990 --> 00:09:16,600]  The y-of-y jump in net income was mainly due to a high base from equipment write-offs.\n",
            "[00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:21,600]  Excluding the write-offs, net income still increased y-of-y for this quarter.\n",
            "[00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:27,460]  For the full year, thanks to mobile service revenue growth y-of-y,\n",
            "[00:09:28,460 --> 00:09:35,460]  sustained e-commerce momentum and rising broadband demand, consolidated revenue grew 17%,\n",
            "[00:09:35,460 --> 00:09:41,460]  and consolidated EBITDA turned to 6% growth in 2021.\n",
            "[00:09:42,460 --> 00:09:47,750]  Both exceeded our full year guidance released in the beginning of the year.\n",
            "[00:09:49,230 --> 00:09:51,230]  Now let's move to balance sheet analysis.\n",
            "[00:09:52,230 --> 00:09:59,930]  On the asset side, cash increased quarter-on-quarter and year-on-year due to higher free cash flow\n",
            "[00:10:00,930 --> 00:10:02,930]  inclusive of subsidies from the government.\n",
            "[00:10:02,930 --> 00:10:11,410]  Receivables climbed year-on-year due to Momo's revenue increase and Tarmobile's direct carrier billing services.\n",
            "[00:10:12,410 --> 00:10:18,020]  PB&E remained stable and 5G capex cycle had already peaked.\n",
            "[00:10:19,020 --> 00:10:26,050]  While non-current contract assets increased year-on-years, we featured 48-month premium handset bundle contracts.\n",
            "[00:10:27,050 --> 00:10:34,780]  As for liabilities, the year-on-year climb in payables was driven mainly by Momo's e-commerce growth.\n",
            "[00:10:35,780 --> 00:10:42,900]  Stronger free cash flow and conversions of our convertible bonds, which matured in November last year,\n",
            "[00:10:43,900 --> 00:10:48,900]  helped improve both current ratio and gearing in the fourth quarter of 2021.\n",
            "[00:10:49,900 --> 00:10:54,060]  Lastly, let's look at cash flow analysis on the next slide.\n",
            "[00:10:58,940 --> 00:11:02,970]  In the fourth quarter, despite a year-on-year increase in EBITDA,\n",
            "[00:11:03,970 --> 00:11:10,970]  higher iPhone payables a year ago resulted in a year-on-year decrease in operating cash inflow.\n",
            "[00:11:12,060 --> 00:11:20,060]  For the full year, the 5% year-on-year drop in operating cash inflow was driven by the rise in contract assets\n",
            "[00:11:21,060 --> 00:11:23,060]  brought about by our longer contract period handset bundle.\n",
            "[00:11:24,060 --> 00:11:33,310]  In 2021, the year-on-year changes in investing and financing cash flows mainly reflected lower cash capex,\n",
            "[00:11:34,310 --> 00:11:41,310]  which is net of government subsidies in 2021, and 5G license payments in 2020, respectively.\n",
            "[00:11:42,310 --> 00:11:53,370]  On the free cash flow front, pre-IFR16 operating cash flow reached $17.08 billion in 2021,\n",
            "[00:11:53,370 --> 00:11:58,370]  translating into a free cash flow yield of 6.1%.\n",
            "[00:11:59,370 --> 00:12:03,660]  Let me turn the presentation back to Jamie for event updates and key messages.\n",
            "[00:12:04,660 --> 00:12:08,660]  Thank you, Rosie. Let's go to page 14 for awards and recognitions.\n",
            "[00:12:09,660 --> 00:12:14,660]  This page summarizes the awards and recognitions that we received during the quarter for your reference.\n",
            "[00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:18,880]  Next, let me walk you through our guidance for 2022.\n",
            "[00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:29,740]  In 2022, we expect consolidated revenue to grow by 15-17% YOY, underpinned by our three growth engines.\n",
            "[00:12:30,740 --> 00:12:38,870]  Please note that this guidance does not take into account our pending merger with Taiwan Star, as the deal still requires regulatory approvals.\n",
            "[00:12:39,870 --> 00:12:45,160]  To ensure growth, we will prudently invest in mobile subscriber acquisition and retention,\n",
            "[00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:55,160]  focusing on upselling via our growing unique bundle options, and increase our premium cable broadband subscribers.\n",
            "[00:12:56,160 --> 00:13:03,160]  As a result of these efforts, we expect consolidated EBITDA to grow by 1-3% in 2022.\n",
            "[00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:12,580]  For 2022 capex, a total of NT$11.2 billion was approved by the board,\n",
            "[00:13:12,580 --> 00:13:16,580]  where 5G capex will decline YOY.\n",
            "[00:13:17,580 --> 00:13:22,740]  MOMO's capex will rise for e-commerce logistics standard expansion,\n",
            "[00:13:23,740 --> 00:13:27,740]  while cable TV investment for broadband growth will continue.\n",
            "[00:13:30,620 --> 00:13:34,620]  Finally, let's turn to page 16 to wrap up our presentation.\n",
            "[00:13:35,620 --> 00:13:38,620]  Here's the key message we would like for you to take away with.\n",
            "[00:13:38,620 --> 00:13:47,230]  In 2021, Taiwan Mobile delivered better-than-expected results and demonstrated our special ability to go to the market\n",
            "[00:13:48,230 --> 00:13:52,230]  with unique offerings that cater to the needs of our customers.\n",
            "[00:13:53,390 --> 00:13:57,390]  Going forward, we expect to continue to allocate capital to growth areas,\n",
            "[00:13:58,390 --> 00:14:04,390]  including the acquisition of Taiwan Star and Synergy Creation post-merger,\n",
            "[00:14:04,390 --> 00:14:12,390]  as well as emerging opportunities in smart logistics, Web3, Metaverse, and Southeast Asia.\n",
            "[00:14:13,490 --> 00:14:19,490]  In order to grow our customer base, meet their growing digital demands, and gain a greater share of their overall spending.\n",
            "[00:14:20,490 --> 00:14:26,060]  With that, I would now open the floor up for Q&A session. Thank you.\n",
            "[00:14:27,060 --> 00:14:28,860]  Thank you, Mr. Lin.\n",
            "[00:14:28,860 --> 00:14:30,860]  Ladies and gentlemen, we will now open for questions.\n",
            "[00:14:31,860 --> 00:14:35,860]  If you would like to register for a question, please press star 1 on your telephone. Thank you.\n",
            "[00:14:36,860 --> 00:14:44,100]  Our first question comes from Neil Anderson with HSBC Hong Kong. Please go ahead. Thank you.\n",
            "[00:14:45,100 --> 00:14:48,830]  Thank you. Good afternoon. Two questions, please.\n",
            "[00:14:49,830 --> 00:14:56,830]  The first one relates to the final slide and the emerging opportunities in smart logistics, Web3, Metaverse, and Southeast Asia.\n",
            "[00:14:56,830 --> 00:15:05,830]  Could you give us a little bit more detail on what your priorities are there and where you believe that Taiwan Mobile has an edge in those areas?\n",
            "[00:15:06,830 --> 00:15:10,860]  The second question relates to the EBITDA guidance.\n",
            "[00:15:11,860 --> 00:15:19,860]  I understand you're probably being conservative, but it does look low relative to the performance you achieved in 2021.\n",
            "[00:15:20,860 --> 00:15:29,960]  Would it be possible to get a bit more color on where you think things might slow down relative to the performance in 2021?\n",
            "[00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:31,960]  That would be great. Thank you.\n",
            "[00:15:33,890 --> 00:15:34,890]  Thank you, Neil.\n",
            "[00:15:35,890 --> 00:15:45,890]  In terms of emerging opportunities for the year 2022, those are the four key areas we will focus on.\n",
            "[00:15:45,890 --> 00:15:53,890]  In terms of smart logistics, it's mainly to further support mobile's growth.\n",
            "[00:15:54,890 --> 00:16:07,920]  In terms of Web3, we're looking into possibilities to work with airport startups to capture this opportunity.\n",
            "[00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:16,920]  In terms of Metaverse, we're also developing some services that we can go to the market with.\n",
            "[00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:30,920]  In terms of Southeast Asia, we have already made investments in startups like Tiki, and we're looking to increase our synergy with them.\n",
            "[00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:35,270]  In terms of EBITDA guidance...\n",
            "[00:16:36,270 --> 00:16:47,550]  The EBITDA guidance is 6%.\n",
            "[00:16:49,860 --> 00:16:52,860]  For 2021, we grew our EBITDA by 6%.\n",
            "[00:16:53,860 --> 00:17:01,310]  For this year, as you can see from the slide, that will be the guidance that we are providing.\n",
            "[00:17:02,310 --> 00:17:06,310]  Why do you think this is conservative compared to the 6% growth that you saw?\n",
            "[00:17:06,310 --> 00:17:10,310]  I think in 2020, we had a relatively low base.\n",
            "[00:17:13,010 --> 00:17:29,010]  In 2021, I think both MOMO's EBITDA and some of our businesses' EBITDA, including broadband, saw some demand surge due to COVID.\n",
            "[00:17:30,010 --> 00:17:34,010]  It resulted in a higher base for 2021.\n",
            "[00:17:35,010 --> 00:17:40,010]  We're taking that factor away from our guidance.\n",
            "[00:17:41,810 --> 00:17:52,870]  Yes, our EBITDA guidance is the management's best projection on what we can achieve for the year.\n",
            "[00:17:53,870 --> 00:17:56,180]  Got it. Thank you very much.\n",
            "[00:17:57,180 --> 00:17:59,180]  Can I just follow up on the investment side?\n",
            "[00:17:59,180 --> 00:18:09,180]  Do you have any parameters in terms of thinking about the amount, the size of the investments you might make in any of those areas or in total?\n",
            "[00:18:10,180 --> 00:18:38,570]  I think in terms of investments, the board has set a framework which is probably above my pay grade to discuss.\n",
            "[00:18:39,570 --> 00:18:45,570]  As you probably know, good opportunities are hard to come by.\n",
            "[00:18:45,570 --> 00:18:57,660]  It's more important that we focus on finding these opportunities instead of thinking of investment as some sort of operation we can predict.\n",
            "[00:18:58,660 --> 00:19:01,170]  I see. Thanks very much.\n",
            "[00:19:02,170 --> 00:19:03,200]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:19:06,410 --> 00:19:09,410]  Thank you. Our next question comes from Sarah Wong with EBS Hong Kong.\n",
            "[00:19:10,410 --> 00:19:12,950]  Thank you. Two questions from me.\n",
            "[00:19:13,950 --> 00:19:22,950]  The first question is that given 5G capex is already peaked, shall we expect a decline in the total capex next year?\n",
            "[00:19:23,950 --> 00:19:26,950]  And then the second question maybe is related to the first question.\n",
            "[00:19:27,950 --> 00:19:37,950]  Given we have already observed a continuous improvement in our rate cash flow as well as earnings, do we have any plan to increase dividend?\n",
            "[00:19:38,950 --> 00:19:39,950]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:19:39,950 --> 00:19:48,060]  I don't think we can comment on capex for the next year.\n",
            "[00:19:49,060 --> 00:19:53,060]  There's a few factors in play here.\n",
            "[00:19:54,060 --> 00:20:01,060]  One of them is we need to continue to invest in logistics to support Momo's growth.\n",
            "[00:20:02,090 --> 00:20:11,090]  So it's hard to predict the capex needs for 2023 in order to help Momo maintain its leadership.\n",
            "[00:20:11,090 --> 00:20:20,090]  In terms of our dividend policy, it's also above our pay grade.\n",
            "[00:20:21,090 --> 00:20:30,310]  Having said that, I think we are always very committed to a stable dividend policy.\n",
            "[00:20:31,310 --> 00:20:44,310]  And it's being factored in in all our plans throughout the company to make it stable as always.\n",
            "[00:20:45,310 --> 00:20:51,210]  Yeah, got it. Thank you.\n",
            "[00:20:52,210 --> 00:20:57,970]  Thank you. Our next question comes from Peter Millican with Deutsche Bank Hong Kong.\n",
            "[00:20:58,970 --> 00:20:59,970]  Just go ahead. Thank you.\n",
            "[00:21:01,450 --> 00:21:03,450]  Yeah, hi. Good afternoon. Thanks for the call.\n",
            "[00:21:03,450 --> 00:21:06,450]  Look, my question is, well, actually a statement first.\n",
            "[00:21:07,450 --> 00:21:09,450]  I'm looking forward to the day when I have a phone that lasts four years.\n",
            "[00:21:10,450 --> 00:21:11,450]  That'll be a first.\n",
            "[00:21:12,450 --> 00:21:19,450]  So I'd be curious as to what happens to those users when they break their phone or something happens to it.\n",
            "[00:21:20,450 --> 00:21:28,930]  What are the terms and how do you avoid that issue and any customer problems that may come out of that?\n",
            "[00:21:28,930 --> 00:21:36,520]  So Peter, are you referring to customers that have signed a longer period contract?\n",
            "[00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:38,520]  Yes, I am.\n",
            "[00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:41,520]  Got it. So there are a few things, right?\n",
            "[00:21:42,520 --> 00:21:49,520]  So number one, they can purchase an insurance with the phone they acquire from us.\n",
            "[00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:55,520]  Usually a significant percentage of the customers would do that.\n",
            "[00:21:55,520 --> 00:22:00,520]  So whenever something happens to their phone, the insurance will cover for it.\n",
            "[00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:10,520]  On top of that, there's also a significant percentage of our users who prefer to bring their own device.\n",
            "[00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:22,520]  So throughout the 48-month contract, some of them might in the middle switch to a new phone that they buy from hopefully Momo.\n",
            "[00:22:22,520 --> 00:22:27,870]  So those are the sort of activities at play in the market right now.\n",
            "[00:22:28,870 --> 00:22:32,930]  I see. Okay. That makes sense. Thank you for that.\n",
            "[00:22:34,090 --> 00:22:35,090]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:22:36,090 --> 00:22:43,040]  Thank you. Once again, ladies and gentlemen, if you'd like to register for questions, please press star 1 on your telephone. Thank you.\n",
            "[00:22:44,040 --> 00:22:56,160]  Once again, ladies and gentlemen, please press star 1 for questions.\n",
            "[00:22:57,160 --> 00:23:11,300]  Once again, ladies and gentlemen, if you have any questions, please press star 1 on your telephone. Thank you.\n",
            "[00:23:11,300 --> 00:23:13,300]  Once again, ladies and gentlemen, please press star 1 on your telephone. Thank you.\n",
            "[00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:31,700]  Once again, ladies and gentlemen, please press star 1 for questions.\n",
            "[00:23:32,700 --> 00:23:41,720]  If there are no further questions, I guess we should call it a day.\n",
            "[00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:48,440]  Mr. Lin, there are no further questions at this point in time. Thank you.\n",
            "[00:23:49,790 --> 00:23:56,790]  All right. Thank you, everyone, for joining this installment of our conference call, and we look forward to having you next time.\n",
            "[00:23:57,790 --> 00:23:58,790]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:03,720]  Thank you. Thank you for participating. This concludes the conference. Goodbye.\n"

            "[00:00:01,050 --> 00:00:07,050]  Good afternoon. Welcome to Taiwan Mobile Conference Call. Chairperson today is Mr. Jamie Lin.\n",
            "[00:00:07,050 --> 00:00:13,490]  Jamie, please begin your call. I'll be standing by for the Q&A session. Thank you.\n",
            "[00:00:13,490 --> 00:00:20,490]  Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone. Good to have you at this edition of Taiwan Mobile Earnings Conference Call.\n",
            "[00:00:20,490 --> 00:00:29,520]  Things have changed quite a bit since the last time we congregated. I hope everyone is doing all right.\n",
            "[00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:35,000]  It is in a sense comforting that we still get to do this the same way.\n",
            "[00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:41,420]  So, before we begin, let's go over our disclaimer first, as always.\n",
            "[00:00:41,420 --> 00:00:49,220]  The information contained in this presentation, including all forward-looking information, is subject to change without notice,\n",

            "[00:01:24,630 --> 00:01:33,110]  All right, now let's head straight to business overview. We will start with highlights of the quarter on page four.\n",
            "[00:01:33,110 --> 00:01:48,140]  In the second quarter of 2021, our three growth engines, namely 5G, e-commerce, and home broadband, all gained further momentum.\n",
            "[00:01:48,140 --> 00:01:58,140]  As a result, YOY growth of our consolidated revenue expanded to 23% for the quarter, the highest among our peers,\n",
            "[00:01:58,140 --> 00:02:04,140]  and accelerated from 6% a year ago and 11% for the previous quarter.\n",
            "[00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:11,620]  Our e-commerce revenue surged by 45% to a record high during the quarter,\n",
            "[00:02:11,620 --> 00:02:22,970]  boosted by consumers' stay-at-home purchasing needs and MOMO's superior logistics and fulfillment capabilities, which we will talk about shortly.\n",
            "[00:02:22,970 --> 00:02:33,900]  Our telecom business, on the other hand, reported YOY growth both on mobile service revenue and on EBITDA for the quarter,\n",
            "[00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:43,310]  the first time in over four years, driven mainly by consistent ARPU lift from our subscribers' upgrades into 5G.\n",
            "[00:02:43,310 --> 00:02:52,980]  Consolidated EBITDA grew by 10% as a result, our highest growth rate in over five years.\n",
            "[00:02:52,980 --> 00:03:01,020]  And I want to highlight that all these record-setting results were achieved while the vast majority of our team members\n",
            "[00:03:02,020 --> 00:03:10,300]  worked from home for the bottom half of the quarter as the country went into Level 3 alert since mid-May.\n",
            "[00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:14,300]  So kudos to my co-workers, you guys are really awesome.\n",
            "[00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:23,760]  Next, let's turn to page 5 for a closer look at our mobile business.\n",
            "[00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:31,790]  At its one-year mark, our 5G services post-pay user base has now grown to almost 900,000.\n",
            "[00:03:31,790 --> 00:03:41,180]  Underpinned by our warp speed infrastructure rollout and superior product offerings,\n",
            "[00:03:41,180 --> 00:03:46,180]  despite some impact on our store traffic since the Level 3 alert,\n",
            "[00:03:46,180 --> 00:03:56,010]  our outstanding bundle packages gained further momentum aimed at growing home broadband and online shopping demand.\n",
            "[00:03:56,010 --> 00:04:01,550]  These include DoublePlay, or Â•ΩÈÄüÊàêÂèå in Chinese,\n",
            "[00:04:01,550 --> 00:04:10,550]  which offers 4G, 5G mobile services bundled with high-speed home broadband starting at $799 NTD a month,\n",
            "[00:04:10,550 --> 00:04:16,030]  and Mo Mobile, or Êë©ÊØîÂ§ö in Chinese,\n",
            "[00:04:16,030 --> 00:04:21,130]  which rewards mobile subscribers as they make more purchases on MoMo.\n",
            "[00:04:22,540 --> 00:04:31,540]  We also saw YOY increases in direct carrier billing and gaming revenues as people consumed more entertainment at home.\n",
            "[00:04:31,540 --> 00:04:43,180]  Coupled with a steady ARPU lift in our users upgrading to 5G and, as a result, a growing 5G user base,\n",
            "[00:04:43,180 --> 00:04:49,220]  our smartphone post-pay ARPU turned to a YOY increase in the second quarter.\n",
            "[00:04:49,220 --> 00:04:55,820]  Customers loved our unparalleled product offerings and value-added services,\n",
            "[00:04:55,820 --> 00:05:02,820]  such as MyVideo, MyMusic, GeForce Now, League of Legends, Wild Rift, and Valorant.\n",
            "[00:05:02,820 --> 00:05:16,400]  And as a result, our churn rate further declined from 0.97% a year ago to 0.77% in the quarter, decreasing by 20 basis points.\n",
            "[00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:21,260]  Going forward, we expect it to remain at low levels.\n",
            "[00:05:21,260 --> 00:05:26,940]  Now let's go to page 6 for an update on our e-commerce business.\n",
            "[00:05:26,940 --> 00:05:40,470]  The heightened online shopping demand as people stayed at home has served as a strong tailwind for MoMo's e-commerce business.\n",
            "[00:05:40,470 --> 00:05:47,570]  In the second quarter, e-commerce revenue grew by 45% YOY to a record high,\n",
            "[00:05:47,570 --> 00:05:53,600]  with the number of transactions rising by 48% YOY.\n",
            "[00:05:53,600 --> 00:06:00,890]  The surge in demand was a true test to all e-commerce companies' infrastructure and adaptability,\n",
            "[00:06:00,890 --> 00:06:03,430]  and the result speaks for itself.\n",
            "[00:06:03,430 --> 00:06:12,430]  MoMo's investment in our cell-line warehouse network and hybrid logistics capabilities leading to this point\n",
            "[00:06:12,430 --> 00:06:17,430]  allowed us to capture the influx in demand better than any of our peers.\n",
            "[00:06:17,430 --> 00:06:20,590]  Accelerating MoMo's market share gain,\n",
            "[00:06:20,590 --> 00:06:28,070]  we also seized the opportunity to offer better incentives for our MoMobile bundle plan users in June,\n",
            "[00:06:28,070 --> 00:06:33,170]  providing extra momentum to both MoMo and our mobile business.\n",
            "[00:06:33,170 --> 00:06:37,840]  Going forward, as the market moves into a new normal,\n",
            "[00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:42,840]  the ramp-up of our Southern Distribution Center's construction\n",
            "[00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:49,840]  and the further expansion of our satellite warehouse network and in-house delivery fleet\n",
            "[00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:53,840]  will provide tailwind to our share gain momentum.\n",
            "[00:06:53,840 --> 00:07:00,480]  In terms of profitability, bolstered by scale economies and operating leverage,\n",
            "[00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:09,090]  e-commerce EBITDA's YOY growth soared to a whopping 129%,\n",
            "[00:07:09,090 --> 00:07:14,090]  while its EBITDA margin widened to 5.5% in the second quarter.\n",
            "[00:07:14,090 --> 00:07:18,890]  Now, let's take a look at our broadband business on the next slide.\n",
            "[00:07:18,890 --> 00:07:25,840]  In the second quarter, we continued to outperform our MSO peers\n",
            "[00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:31,840]  in the YOY trends of basic TV subscriptions and broadband service penetration.\n",
            "[00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:40,260]  More importantly, demand for faster home broadband access continued to grow amid work and study from home.\n",
            "[00:07:40,260 --> 00:07:50,260]  Lifting cable broadband line of revenue by 12% and more than offset the decline in basic TV revenue.\n",
            "[00:07:50,260 --> 00:07:58,440]  Now, let's turn to the next slide to talk about our accelerated transformation during and post-pandemic.\n",
            "[00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:07,420]  On this slide, I would like to share with you how Taiwan Mobile has responded to the challenges\n",
            "[00:08:07,420 --> 00:08:10,420]  brought about by the COVID outbreak in Taiwan.\n",
            "[00:08:10,420 --> 00:08:17,800]  During the first outbreak in the beginning of 2020, we immediately activated our business continuity plan\n",
            "[00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:25,800]  and segregated our entire company into AB teams that can fully back up each other.\n",
            "[00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:30,830]  At the same time, we started making all the necessary investments and preparations\n",
            "[00:08:30,830 --> 00:08:33,830]  to make broad-based work from home a viable option.\n",
            "[00:08:33,830 --> 00:08:40,310]  That is the reason why when the country went into level three alert in mid-May this year,\n",
            "[00:08:40,310 --> 00:08:46,310]  we were able to immediately shift all of our back office employees to remote work.\n",
            "[00:08:46,310 --> 00:08:52,660]  Additionally, we make use of telecom data to monitor countrywide work from home trends\n",
            "[00:08:52,660 --> 00:08:58,660]  and adjusted the opening hours and locations of our stores accordingly,\n",
            "[00:08:58,660 --> 00:09:04,140]  resulting in a better workforce safety without having to sacrifice operating results.\n",
            "[00:09:05,690 --> 00:09:15,690]  Our record-setting quarterly performance showcased both our resilience and the efficacy of our strategy.\n",
            "[00:09:15,690 --> 00:09:20,170]  While in time, the pandemic will certainly go away,\n",
            "[00:09:20,170 --> 00:09:25,780]  the transformation that took place for us during this time is here to stay.\n",
            "[00:09:25,780 --> 00:09:29,780]  Taiwan Mobile will emerge as a hybrid organization,\n",
            "[00:09:29,780 --> 00:09:36,580]  which will in turn accelerate our growth and evolution into a regional tech plus telco group.\n",
            "[00:09:36,580 --> 00:09:40,580]  Now let me turn the presentation over to Rosy for financial overview.\n",
            "[00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:43,950]  Hi, good afternoon.\n",
            "[00:09:43,950 --> 00:09:50,530]  Let's start with performance by business on page 10.\n",
            "[00:09:50,530 --> 00:09:58,620]  In the second quarter of this year, consolidated revenue grew by 23% on a year-on-year basis,\n",
            "[00:09:58,620 --> 00:10:04,940]  supported by robust e-commerce business and improving telecom business.\n",
            "[00:10:04,940 --> 00:10:10,170]  Mobile service revenue showed year-on-year increases since March,\n",
            "[00:10:10,170 --> 00:10:17,710]  which helped expand telecom revenues growth to 5% year-on-year in the second quarter.\n",
            "[00:10:17,710 --> 00:10:20,710]  With a smaller year-on-year rise in handset subsidies\n",
            "[00:10:20,710 --> 00:10:26,710]  and a normalized phase in roaming business versus the previous quarter,\n",
            "[00:10:26,710 --> 00:10:32,450]  the telecom EBITDA turned to a year-on-year increase in the second quarter.\n",
            "[00:10:32,450 --> 00:10:36,450]  Though the telecom V&A continued to post year-on-year growth,\n",
            "[00:10:36,450 --> 00:10:41,480]  given our 5G investment, the sequential hike diminished\n",
            "[00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:46,020]  as a result of our front-loaded rollout strategy.\n",
            "[00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:55,270]  Our cable TV EBITDA year-on-year trend stabilized, driven by broadband.\n",
            "[00:10:55,270 --> 00:10:59,270]  MOMO continued its growth trajectory propelled by e-commerce,\n",
            "[00:10:59,270 --> 00:11:03,270]  which recorded a 45% revenue growth year-on-year\n",
            "[00:11:03,270 --> 00:11:09,270]  and a 129% EBITDA surge year-on-year in the second quarter.\n",
            "[00:11:09,270 --> 00:11:16,600]  Now let's move to result summary.\n",
            "[00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:20,600]  The 5G DNA still weighed on our telecom profitability,\n",
            "[00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:25,600]  but successful 5G upselling and MOMO's upbeat performance\n",
            "[00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:31,600]  helped consolidated operating income turn to a year-on-year rise in the second quarter.\n",
            "[00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:36,890]  The difference in the year-on-year trends of pre-tax income and net income\n",
            "[00:11:36,890 --> 00:11:43,890]  was mainly due to a year-on-year climb in net income attributable to minority interest.\n",
            "[00:11:43,890 --> 00:11:50,260]  For the first half of this year, consolidated revenue and EBITDA\n",
            "[00:11:50,260 --> 00:11:55,260]  were both ahead of our full-year guidance released earlier this year.\n",
            "[00:11:55,260 --> 00:12:04,640]  Let's move on to balance sheet analysis.\n",
            "[00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:07,640]  On the asset side, the year-on-year increase in cash\n",
            "[00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:11,640]  was mainly driven by MOMO's business expansion.\n",
            "[00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:20,250]  TD&E rose on the back of our 5G network rollout since the second half of 2020,\n",
            "[00:12:20,250 --> 00:12:24,600]  while non-current contract assets climbed year-on-year\n",
            "[00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:30,140]  as we featured rate plans with longer contract periods.\n",
            "[00:12:30,140 --> 00:12:35,140]  As for liabilities, MOMO's rapid expansion in the second quarter\n",
            "[00:12:35,140 --> 00:12:38,140]  resulted in an uptick in payable year-on-year,\n",
            "[00:12:38,140 --> 00:12:41,140]  while inventory growth was constrained\n",
            "[00:12:41,140 --> 00:12:46,140]  due to shorter inventory turnover and receivable days than payable days.\n",
            "[00:12:46,140 --> 00:12:50,560]  Other current liabilities spiked year-on-year,\n",
            "[00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:57,170]  reflecting the larger 5G equipment payable to Nokia and MOMO's dividend payable.\n",
            "[00:12:57,170 --> 00:13:06,120]  Net debt to equity and net debt to EBITDA improved in the second quarter\n",
            "[00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:11,540]  thanks to higher EBITDA and MOMO's strong cash generation capability.\n",
            "[00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:17,660]  Lastly, let's look at the cash flow analysis on the next slide.\n",
            "[00:13:17,660 --> 00:13:26,000]  In the second quarter, operating cash inflow increased year-on-year\n",
            "[00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:32,100]  thanks to better cash earnings in our telecom and e-commerce businesses,\n",
            "[00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:37,830]  as well as the scale effect from MOMO's negative cash conversion cycle.\n",
            "[00:13:37,830 --> 00:13:44,830]  For investing cash flow, although cash capex rose sequentially in the second quarter,\n",
            "[00:13:44,830 --> 00:13:49,830]  it was lower in the first half of 2021 than the second half of 2020\n",
            "[00:13:49,830 --> 00:13:53,890]  when we kicked off 5G rollout.\n",
            "[00:13:53,890 --> 00:13:57,890]  Financial cash outflow dropped year-on-year in the second quarter\n",
            "[00:13:57,890 --> 00:14:01,890]  due to the repayment of short-term borrowings a year ago\n",
            "[00:14:01,890 --> 00:14:06,980]  and the different timing of MOMO's dividend payment versus last year.\n",
            "[00:14:06,980 --> 00:14:14,650]  With better operating cash flow along with stabilized capex,\n",
            "[00:14:14,650 --> 00:14:19,650]  free cash flow improved both quarter-on-quarter and half-on-half.\n",
            "[00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:30,960]  Free cash flow calculated with pre-IFR 16 operating cash flow reached $7.66 billion\n",
            "[00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:35,060]  in the first half of 2021,\n",
            "[00:14:35,060 --> 00:14:41,540]  translating into an analyzed free cash flow yield of 5.3%.\n",
            "[00:14:41,540 --> 00:14:46,950]  Let me turn the presentation back to Jamie for event update and team message.\n",
            "[00:14:46,950 --> 00:14:47,950]  Thank you, Rosie.\n",
            "[00:14:47,950 --> 00:14:54,110]  On page 15, you can see a summary of the awards and recognitions we received\n",
            "[00:14:54,110 --> 00:14:56,110]  during the quarter for your reference.\n",
            "[00:14:56,110 --> 00:15:03,130]  And finally, on slide 16, to wrap up our presentation,\n",
            "[00:15:03,130 --> 00:15:08,740]  here is a key message we would like for you to take away with.\n",
            "[00:15:08,740 --> 00:15:12,740]  We have weathered through telecom EBITDA compression\n",
            "[00:15:12,740 --> 00:15:16,740]  and restored its worldwide growth in 2Q21\n",
            "[00:15:16,740 --> 00:15:19,770]  while accelerating MOMO's EBITDA upswing.\n",
            "[00:15:19,770 --> 00:15:27,180]  This turnaround in our operations shows our strategic resilience amid the pandemic.\n",
            "[00:15:27,180 --> 00:15:31,410]  The societal shift to everything from home,\n",
            "[00:15:31,410 --> 00:15:37,410]  where the world increasingly relies on digital connectivity for work, education, and more,\n",
            "[00:15:37,410 --> 00:15:42,410]  will lay the foundation for our continuous expansions going forward.\n",
            "[00:15:42,410 --> 00:15:44,440]  In this new normal,\n",
            "[00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:48,440]  our accelerated transformation into a regional tech plus telco group\n",
            "[00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:51,440]  will position us for an even faster growth\n",
            "[00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:55,440]  while creating further long-term value for shareholders.\n",
            "[00:15:55,440 --> 00:16:00,300]  With that, I will now open the floor up for Q&A session.\n",
            "[00:16:00,300 --> 00:16:05,240]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:08,660]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are now calling for questions.\n",
            "[00:16:08,660 --> 00:16:13,660]  If you wish to ask a question, please press star 1 on your telephone touchpad.\n",
            "[00:16:13,660 --> 00:16:14,660]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:16:14,660 --> 00:16:22,270]  Our first question comes from Neil of HSBC.\n",
            "[00:16:22,270 --> 00:16:24,270]  Please go ahead with your questions.\n",
            "[00:16:24,270 --> 00:16:27,260]  Thank you. Good afternoon, Jamie, Rosie.\n",
            "[00:16:27,260 --> 00:16:30,260]  Congratulations on a strong quarter.\n",
            "[00:16:30,260 --> 00:16:34,260]  I have one main question around the EBITDA trend.\n",
            "[00:16:34,260 --> 00:16:40,260]  If I'm right, your guidance at the start of the year was for a flat to 2% decline in EBITDA,\n",
            "[00:16:40,260 --> 00:16:44,260]  and in the first half, you've reported a 3% increase.\n",
            "[00:16:44,260 --> 00:16:48,260]  Is that because the second quarter, MOMO and others were faster,\n",
            "[00:16:48,260 --> 00:16:51,260]  perhaps the telecom business recovered faster than expected?\n",
            "[00:16:51,260 --> 00:16:54,260]  And how does that affect your outlook for the second half?\n",
            "[00:16:55,260 --> 00:16:59,300]  Do you expect costs to increase or these trends to continue?\n",
            "[00:16:59,300 --> 00:17:00,300]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:17:00,300 --> 00:17:07,190]  Thank you, Neil.\n",
            "[00:17:07,190 --> 00:17:16,190]  Yes, so the telecom business and MOMO are both doing better than we expected.\n",
            "[00:17:16,190 --> 00:17:20,190]  And right now, we're not revising our guidance,\n",
            "[00:17:20,190 --> 00:17:26,190]  but we also don't expect things to significantly worsen in the bottom half of the year.\n",
            "[00:17:26,190 --> 00:17:29,400]  Okay. Thank you.\n",
            "[00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:30,400]  Could I follow up?\n",
            "[00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:33,400]  You mentioned MOMO.\n",
            "[00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:36,400]  Can you give any more details on that, how many subscribers,\n",
            "[00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:43,400]  or what you think the potential opportunity is to link your telecom services with MOMO?\n",
            "[00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:46,030]  Thank you, Neil.\n",
            "[00:17:46,030 --> 00:17:49,030]  We're not disclosing the number of subscribers yet,\n",
            "[00:17:49,030 --> 00:17:58,030]  but I can say that it's contributing more than 1% to MOMO's revenue already.\n",
            "[00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:07,980]  So all of the subscribers are contributing more than 1% of MOMO's revenues.\n",
            "[00:18:07,980 --> 00:18:08,980]  Thanks very much.\n",
            "[00:18:08,980 --> 00:18:10,460]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:18:10,460 --> 00:18:13,340]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:18:13,340 --> 00:18:18,340]  Ladies and gentlemen, if you have other questions, please press star 1.\n",
            "[00:18:18,340 --> 00:18:28,210]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:18:28,210 --> 00:18:31,210]  Once again, it's star 1 to ask questions.\n",
            "[00:18:31,210 --> 00:18:51,500]  Thank you.\n",

            "[00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:19,040]  Hi there. Good afternoon. Thanks for the opportunity and congratulations on the\n",
            "[00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:24,080]  improving trend in March. It's good to see it's been a long time coming. I have two questions\n",
            "[00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:29,840]  relating to the EBITDA decline in the first quarter and how that might evolve going into\n",
            "[00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:36,350]  the second quarter. So you mentioned that two of the drivers of that were higher upselling costs\n",
            "[00:13:36,350 --> 00:13:43,630]  related to marketing and also lower roaming compared to the first quarter last year.\n",
            "[00:13:43,870 --> 00:13:46,990]  Could you give us a bit more color on that? The first quarter\n",
            "[00:13:47,710 --> 00:13:53,070]  marketing cost, do you expect that to continue into 2Q or is that likely to tail off as the\n",
            "[00:13:53,070 --> 00:13:59,790]  iPhone 12 sales, say, for example, wind down? And then the roaming part of that,\n",
            "[00:13:59,790 --> 00:14:07,180]  how large a factor might that be? Thank you. Thank you, Neil, and thank you for the kind words.\n",
            "[00:14:08,140 --> 00:14:20,740]  So in January and February of 2021, we're still suffering from a worldwide decline of\n",
            "[00:14:20,740 --> 00:14:31,220]  roaming EBITDA. But starting from March, roaming becomes almost a non-factor on a worldwide basis.\n",
            "[00:14:32,180 --> 00:14:42,140]  In terms of marketing costs, we do foresee that to remain pretty consistent.\n",
            "[00:14:44,940 --> 00:14:51,900]  And we're investing for longer-term growth and longer-term uplift in our pool. So\n",
            "[00:14:54,820 --> 00:15:00,610]  that's what I can say for now. Okay. So just to clarify on the second point,\n",
            "[00:15:01,330 --> 00:15:07,250]  if I remember rightly, you were really trying to save costs during the 4G or the later half of the\n",
            "[00:15:07,250 --> 00:15:15,200]  4G period in terms of marketing. So with this early stage of 5G, you've increased your spending\n",
            "[00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:20,160]  on marketing and upgrade costs and that's likely to remain consistent. Is that the right understanding?\n",
            "[00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:32,340]  Right now, we're observing a pretty healthy ARPU lift of 26% monthly fee. And we want to\n",
            "[00:15:33,540 --> 00:15:42,180]  lock users in for a longer period. That's why we're offering the most comprehensive 48-month\n",
            "[00:15:42,660 --> 00:15:50,100]  zero-dollar bundle plan. And we foresee the uptake of that bundle plan to remain\n",
            "[00:15:50,740 --> 00:15:57,940]  relatively consistent over time. Of course, the marketing cost as a percentage of revenue\n",
            "[00:15:57,940 --> 00:16:10,990]  will continue to decrease as our top line continues to grow of the increased users upgrading to 5G.\n",
            "[00:16:13,470 --> 00:16:16,000]  Got it. Thank you very much. Thank you.\n",
            "[00:16:17,940 --> 00:16:23,300]  Thank you. Our next question comes from Sarah of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead, Sarah.\n",
            "[00:16:25,260 --> 00:16:31,740]  Thank you, management, for the opportunity to ask a question. So I have two questions. First,\n",
            "[00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:40,060]  on 5G. So the 26% 5G ARPU lift, may I ask how is this number calculated? Is it like\n",
            "[00:16:40,060 --> 00:16:47,020]  apple to apple comparison? For example, for the same person, they're paying 26% more before and\n",
            "[00:16:47,020 --> 00:16:54,780]  after migrating to 5G. And then the second question is on the dividend. So it seems we cut\n",
            "[00:16:54,780 --> 00:17:02,140]  dividend for 2020 payment. And then going into 2021, because for this year, there will be a\n",
            "[00:17:02,140 --> 00:17:08,620]  four-year impact from the 5G spectrum amortization cost versus half year last year. So do we see any\n",
            "[00:17:08,620 --> 00:17:17,950]  further pressure to cut dividend further? Thank you, Sarah. For the first question, yes,\n",
            "[00:17:17,950 --> 00:17:27,870]  it's calculated based on the pre and post 5G sign up monthly fee difference. So we take the, when\n",
            "[00:17:27,870 --> 00:17:36,510]  the users renew their contract from 4G into a 5G contract, we compare the monthly fee before and\n",
            "[00:17:36,510 --> 00:17:43,870]  after to calculate that number. And right now we're observing a 26% uplift. In terms of dividend,\n",
            "[00:17:44,510 --> 00:17:56,930]  let Rosie talk about it. Well, we have a rather stable dividend policy. And I think the dividend\n",
            "[00:17:56,930 --> 00:18:04,400]  policy will still be decided by the board every April. That's all I can share with you.\n",
            "[00:18:10,030 --> 00:18:17,150]  Got it. Just a follow-up question on a dividend. So would you please share any color on what kind\n",
            "[00:18:17,150 --> 00:18:23,630]  of metrics the board is considering when deciding the dividend? It seems we have a really sufficient\n",
            "[00:18:24,190 --> 00:18:31,630]  equity reserve and then all the operating metrics cash flow is improving. So what do you think is\n",
            "[00:18:31,630 --> 00:18:42,160]  the key metrics going forward? I think I'm not in a position to share the metrics with you,\n",
            "[00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:53,780]  but they do have thorough discussions on this and decided this number. Okay, got it. Thank you.\n",
            "[00:18:56,670 --> 00:19:01,230]  Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, if you have other questions,\n",

            "[00:19:24,100 --> 00:19:33,470]  questions and also congratulations to get an honor. I have two questions. My first question\n",
            "[00:19:34,190 --> 00:19:47,390]  is about could you give us about the EBITDA rate in the 2021 originally our forecast,\n",
            "[00:19:47,390 --> 00:19:57,490]  internal forecast? Because I'm interested how will we compare the actual result in the forecast,\n",
            "[00:19:58,210 --> 00:20:03,790]  internal forecast by ourselves? This is my first question. Thank you.\n",
            "[00:20:06,380 --> 00:20:13,340]  Thank you, Jack for your kind words. We only gave a four-year guidance of EBITDA YOY between\n",
            "[00:20:13,340 --> 00:20:23,020]  negative 2% to 0%. That's the only guidance that we gave. And right now, as we say in March,\n",
            "[00:20:23,020 --> 00:20:36,460]  we're observing EBITDA YOY to have turned positive. So does that mean the EBITDA margin\n",
            "[00:20:37,100 --> 00:20:46,670]  rate will above our internal forecast? Thank you. Thank you. Like I said in the key message,\n",
            "[00:20:48,030 --> 00:20:53,470]  right now we're expecting the company to achieve our EBITDA guidance for 2021.\n",
            "[00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:07,950]  So can I just check what's our target for our EBITDA margin for the 2021?\n",
            "[00:21:11,630 --> 00:21:17,630]  Sorry, we don't disclose full year guidance for this year. So we cannot disclose the EBITDA margin\n",
            "[00:21:17,630 --> 00:21:29,040]  to you. Okay. Got it. And will we provide our financial forecast for the second quarter\n",
            "[00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:39,840]  2021? Because now we haven't seen our four-year financial forecast in this year. So could you\n",
            "[00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:50,340]  give us some forecast about our second quarter 2021? Thank you. I'm sorry, we won't do that.\n",
            "[00:21:55,730 --> 00:22:06,050]  Okay. But do we have any, the second quarter revenue will grow and also how will our EBITDA\n",
            "[00:22:06,050 --> 00:22:13,730]  margin will go in the second quarter? Do we have any guidance or a few for the second quarter?\n",
            "[00:22:13,730 --> 00:22:21,280]  Thank you. Jay, thank you very much. I might have to ask you to refer to our four-year guidance.\n",
            "[00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:32,300]  We will not segregate that number into quarterly basis. Okay. Okay. So but do we have any direction\n",
            "[00:22:32,300 --> 00:22:40,140]  even in comparison with the first quarter? How will be the second quarter 2021 will be\n",
            "[00:22:40,140 --> 00:22:47,260]  that maybe will grow, maybe meet single digit or something else? Do we have this kind of view?\n",
            "[00:22:47,660 --> 00:22:53,600]  Could we provide? Thank you. So qualitatively, like I said in a key message,\n",
            "[00:22:54,240 --> 00:23:01,600]  we do expect all three of our growth engines, so namely 5G, MOMO and broadband to continue\n",
            "[00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:07,120]  to accelerate. So qualitatively, that will be the guidance that we provide.\n",
            "[00:23:09,580 --> 00:23:18,240]  Okay. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, Jack. Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen,\n",
            "[00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:30,130]  if you have other questions, please press star one. Thank you. Once again, it's star one to ask\n",
            "[00:23:30,130 --> 00:23:55,540]  a question. Thank you. Jack has another follow-up question. Please go ahead.\n",
            "[00:23:56,500 --> 00:24:03,700]  Yes. Just one follow-up question. Thank you. And also thank you. Thanks for the chance. Another\n",
            "[00:24:03,700 --> 00:24:10,500]  question. And my another question is about, could you give us about some information about our 5G\n",
            "[00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:19,060]  base station? How many 5G base stations we have deployed now until now? Thank you.\n",
            "[00:24:22,430 --> 00:24:30,510]  Thank you, Jack. Like I said in the presentation, we have deployed more than 6,000 3.5 gigahertz\n",
            "[00:24:31,150 --> 00:24:38,240]  high-speed 5G stations as of today. More than 6,000? Thank you.\n",
            "[00:24:42,420 --> 00:24:47,780]  Okay. And then Sarah from Morgan Stanley has another follow-up question. Please go ahead,\n",
            "[00:24:47,780 --> 00:24:56,080]  Sarah. Thank you. Just one question on 5G. So how's the use case we have seen so far from the\n",
            "[00:24:56,080 --> 00:25:03,360]  consumers? And also I think previously there's a market concern that telemobile might acquire\n",
            "[00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:09,040]  less sufficient spectrum bandwidth than peers. So given the 5G service has been launched by\n",
            "[00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:18,240]  almost like over half a year, so do we see any, say, download speed or service feedback from\n",
            "[00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:32,020]  users on our 5G services? Sure. Thank you, Sarah. So the 5G use case on the consumer side right now\n",
            "[00:25:32,980 --> 00:25:41,780]  is still a continuum from 4G. So users are mainly watching videos, playing games,\n",
            "[00:25:41,780 --> 00:25:51,780]  listening to music, and conducting live video calls, et cetera. So there's not a huge difference\n",
            "[00:25:52,660 --> 00:25:59,300]  in their behavior versus 4G. Of course, they're doing all of these at a much higher speed and\n",
            "[00:25:59,300 --> 00:26:07,620]  using a less congested network. So they are having a much better user experience. And it's also\n",
            "[00:26:08,580 --> 00:26:15,300]  providing a better user experience for some of the users that are remaining on 4G.\n",
            "[00:26:16,370 --> 00:26:22,370]  In terms of the fact that we have less spectrum, at this point we don't think\n",
            "[00:26:23,330 --> 00:26:31,330]  it's any disadvantage. So if you look at our monthly fee lift and our 5G penetration, I think\n",
            "[00:26:31,410 --> 00:26:41,330]  we're doing as well as any of our peers are doing. And we are able to roll out a much wider coverage\n",
            "[00:26:42,450 --> 00:26:53,940]  certified by NCC because we saved some cash on the spectrum. And in the end, we're providing a much\n",
            "[00:26:53,940 --> 00:27:07,010]  better 5G experience because of the coverage. So if you look back, I think our strategy does\n",
            "[00:27:07,010 --> 00:27:15,440]  lend us some competitive advantage. Thank you. Just one quick follow-up. So\n",
            "[00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:21,280]  given our 5G network rollout is actually faster than peers, for example, the number of base stations\n",
            "[00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:28,800]  is higher by the end of last year and also so far. So do we see any cost pressure from\n",
            "[00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:39,040]  running the 5G network? Yes. So if you look at our bottom line,\n",
            "[00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:48,720]  the added DNA is indeed taking some toll on our bottom line. But we see 5G as a growth engine. And\n",
            "[00:27:49,440 --> 00:28:01,870]  if you want to harness the momentum of this engine, you have to be committed to the strategy.\n",
            "[00:28:01,870 --> 00:28:11,390]  So we're going to continue to accelerate our 5G user-based growth to make the investment worthwhile.\n",
            "[00:28:14,830 --> 00:28:17,570]  Got it. Thank you. Thank you, Sarah.\n",
            "[00:28:19,020 --> 00:28:22,700]  Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, if you have other questions,\n",
            "[00:28:22,700 --> 00:28:37,380]  please press star 1. Thank you. Once again, it's star 1 to ask a question. Thank you.\n",
            "[00:28:53,070 --> 00:28:56,030]  And Jack has another question. Please go ahead, Jack.\n",
            "[00:28:57,520 --> 00:29:04,320]  Okay. And also thanks for another chance to ask a question. And I have two questions.\n",
            "[00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:11,040]  My first question is about so for the revenue guide in the 2021, we are also the same\n",
            "[00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:18,400]  with the last earning call, we have mentioned that this year maybe revenue will\n",
            "[00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:30,160]  go up to 12% over a year. But because the MOMO, it seems that some of their revenue guidance,\n",
            "[00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:37,360]  so will that mean will we change our revenue growth guidance in the whole year?\n",
            "[00:29:40,130 --> 00:29:46,850]  Thank you, Jack. At this point, we're not giving a new guidance. So we're going to stick to our\n",
            "[00:29:46,850 --> 00:29:59,180]  original guidance. Okay. Got it. And my second question is about we have announced we will\n",
            "[00:29:59,900 --> 00:30:11,900]  invest the green power in the following years and try to use all green energy until\n",
            "[00:30:13,020 --> 00:30:22,380]  not until the 2040. And so could you give us about how some information,\n",
            "[00:30:22,700 --> 00:30:32,140]  or how does this kind of strategy will affect our revenue or cost in the following years?\n",
            "[00:30:33,020 --> 00:30:37,410]  Thank you. Thank you, Jack. So we have identified\n",
            "[00:30:40,990 --> 00:30:51,070]  some of the sources of renewable energy to actually provide a lower cost than the electricity\n",
            "[00:30:51,070 --> 00:30:59,470]  you obtain from high power. So going forward, we will do this methodically and make sure it's a\n",
            "[00:31:00,430 --> 00:31:05,550]  triple win for both the company, our shareholder and the environment.\n",
            "[00:31:09,630 --> 00:31:23,260]  Thank you. So how about when will the positive effect for the cost? I mean, when we\n",
            "[00:31:23,580 --> 00:31:28,860]  do this strategy, when will the cost will lower?\n",
            "[00:31:32,260 --> 00:31:39,700]  Thank you. It is hard to predict at this point, because to implement a renewable\n",
            "[00:31:40,820 --> 00:31:50,260]  energy investment strategies, there's a lot of new type of stakeholders that we were previously not\n",
            "[00:31:50,740 --> 00:31:59,380]  extremely familiar with. So we're still figuring things out as we go. So that is why it's a longer\n",
            "[00:31:59,380 --> 00:32:07,700]  term strategy, and we don't expect it to affect our top or bottom line anytime soon.\n",
            "[00:32:09,460 --> 00:32:17,380]  Okay, got it. But we have also mentioned we may invest to build the power plant,\n",
            "[00:32:17,380 --> 00:32:27,540]  a renewable power plant. Will that renewable power plant, I mean, all energy from the renewable\n",
            "[00:32:28,500 --> 00:32:37,620]  power plant we invest will be used by ourselves, or will we sell the renewable energy to other\n",
            "[00:32:37,620 --> 00:32:43,900]  companies in the future? Thank you. Thank you. First and foremost, we want to\n",
            "[00:32:44,860 --> 00:32:52,860]  satisfy our own usage needs. And of course, if we have gotten to a point where we're pretty good at\n",
            "[00:32:52,860 --> 00:32:59,490]  doing this, then we might consider to commercialize it into a business. But it's really a longer term\n",
            "[00:32:59,490 --> 00:33:08,380]  thing. We're not expecting any of these to have any material effect in the short term.\n",
            "[00:33:08,380 --> 00:33:11,100]  Okay, got it. Thank you. It's very helpful. Thank you.\n",
            "[00:33:11,820 --> 00:33:14,720]  Thank you, Jack. Thank you.\n",
            "[00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:26,820]  Ladies and gentlemen, if you have other questions, please press star one. Thank you. Once again,\n",
            "[00:33:26,820 --> 00:33:41,650]  it's star one to ask a question. Thank you. Jimmy, there seems to be no other questions online.\n",
            "[00:33:43,460 --> 00:33:49,060]  All right. So if that's the case, thank you. And thank you, everyone, for joining this\n",
            "[00:33:50,500 --> 00:33:56,580]  installment of our quarterly results communication. And have a good evening. We look forward to seeing\n",

            "[00:01:16,620 --> 00:01:21,350]  So on page four, let's look back at 2020.\n",
            "[00:01:21,350 --> 00:01:27,350]  Our mobile business in the second half took the lead in 5G infrastructure build-out,\n",
            "[00:01:27,350 --> 00:01:32,350]  which resulted in a significantly better 5G coverage than our peers.\n",
            "[00:01:32,350 --> 00:01:42,350]  That coupled with the release of attractive 5G smart devices, including Samsung Note20 and iPhone 12 lines,\n",
            "[00:01:42,350 --> 00:01:47,380]  served as tailwinds and kicked off the revenue turnaround of the business.\n",
            "[00:01:47,380 --> 00:01:56,150]  By the end of 2020, we successfully signed up more than 465,000 5G users,\n",
            "[00:01:56,150 --> 00:02:07,180]  representing a 6.4% overall and an 8% post-pay penetration, both of which led the industry.\n",
            "[00:02:07,180 --> 00:02:15,540]  More importantly, our post-pay smartphone monthly fee has recorded sequential growth since September 2020.\n",
            "[00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:24,140]  Our mobile e-commerce business, on the other hand, continued to post robust momentum, both on the top and on the bottom lines.\n",
            "[00:02:25,140 --> 00:02:33,880]  As we increased our market share following continued investment in industry-leading logistic infrastructure\n",
            "[00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:40,880]  and leveraged our group's resources, such as direct store, pickup, and cross-selling to mobile customers,\n",
            "[00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:46,300]  2020 net income came in ahead of management guidance by 1%,\n",
            "[00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:57,260]  Headwinds from 5G-related DNA and plunged roaming business due to travel restrictions amid COVID-19\n",
            "[00:02:57,260 --> 00:03:03,260]  were more than offset by SG&A's savings and MOMO's better-than-expected contribution.\n",
            "[00:03:03,260 --> 00:03:09,670]  Let's turn to slide 5 for a closer look at our telecom business.\n",
            "[00:03:11,790 --> 00:03:21,790]  Increasing 5G handset options coupled with the popularity of 5G Unlimited data plans starting at $13.99\n",
            "[00:03:21,790 --> 00:03:29,790]  spurred the faster-than-expected 5G adoption and provided solid upselling momentum for our mobile business.\n",
            "[00:03:29,790 --> 00:03:38,210]  In the fourth quarter, close to 90% of our 5G sign-ups opted for $9.99-plus plans,\n",
            "[00:03:38,210 --> 00:03:47,300]  while over 80% of customers who signed up for iPhone 12 series bundles opted for $13.99-plus plans.\n",
            "[00:03:47,300 --> 00:03:57,400]  As a result, monthly fee lift for users upgrading to 5G reached 24% since launch,\n",
            "[00:03:57,400 --> 00:04:03,400]  hence the aforementioned sequential improvement in our post-phase smartphone monthly fees.\n",
            "[00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:10,880]  Furthermore, our double-play bundle, which is unlimited mobile data plus high-speed home broadband,\n",
            "[00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:16,910]  continued to be a major attraction for subscribers in the fourth quarter,\n",
            "[00:04:16,910 --> 00:04:24,910]  with 24% new sign-ups opting for 500Mbps-plus home broadband services.\n",
            "[00:04:24,910 --> 00:04:31,520]  Our efforts in customer retention via differentiating bundle plans have paid off,\n",
            "[00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:36,810]  evidenced by our falling post-phase churn rates in the past few years.\n",
            "[00:04:36,810 --> 00:04:42,810]  With our strategy to lock in high R-pool customers into longer bundle contracts,\n",
            "[00:04:42,810 --> 00:04:46,840]  we expect the churn rate to remain at low levels going forward.\n",
            "[00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:52,130]  Now let's turn to page 6 for an update on our cable TV business.\n",
            "[00:04:52,130 --> 00:04:59,760]  In the fourth quarter of 2020, we continued to fare better than our MSO peers\n",
            "[00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:06,980]  in the YOY trends of basic TV subscriptions and broadband service penetration.\n",
            "[00:05:06,980 --> 00:05:13,980]  Supported by the growth in TV content aggregation revenue and accelerating broadband momentum,\n",
            "[00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:19,690]  CA TV revenue went up by 5% YOY in the fourth quarter.\n",
            "[00:05:19,690 --> 00:05:28,690]  Meanwhile, demand for faster home broadband access, including double-play packages, continued to swell,\n",
            "[00:05:28,690 --> 00:05:33,850]  lifting cable broadband-related revenue by 11% YOY.\n",
            "[00:05:33,850 --> 00:05:39,850]  Coupled with YOY decline in DNA, EBIT grew 5% in the quarter.\n",
            "[00:05:39,850 --> 00:05:46,070]  Last but not least, let's take a look at our growth engine, MOMO, on slide number 7.\n",
            "[00:05:46,070 --> 00:05:51,870]  As the e-commerce leader in Taiwan, MOMO continued to grab market share\n",
            "[00:05:51,870 --> 00:05:54,870]  from both online peers and offline retailers,\n",
            "[00:05:54,870 --> 00:05:59,970]  and delivered smashing results during the Double 11 Shopping Festival.\n",
            "[00:05:59,970 --> 00:06:06,320]  For the fall year, the total number of orders surged by 36%.\n",
            "[00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:10,670]  Daljixix remained a key focal area for MOMO.\n",
            "[00:06:10,670 --> 00:06:15,670]  In addition to ongoing expansion of the in-house delivery fleet,\n",
            "[00:06:15,670 --> 00:06:19,670]  which already accounted for 11% of its last-mile delivery,\n",
            "[00:06:19,670 --> 00:06:23,960]  three more satellite warehouses were added in the fourth quarter.\n",
            "[00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:29,120]  This takes the total number of satellite warehouses to 22,\n",
            "[00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:35,150]  eight more than a year ago, further increasing our lead in infrastructure capabilities.\n",
            "[00:06:35,150 --> 00:06:39,760]  As a result of increasing scale and operating leverage,\n",
            "[00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:45,760]  MOMO's 2020 e-commerce EBITDA margin improved meaningfully from 2019,\n",
            "[00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:52,760]  resulting in a 55% boost in absolute EBITDA numbers.\n",
            "[00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:56,920]  Payment processing fee as a percentage of revenue also dropped,\n",
            "[00:06:56,920 --> 00:07:04,920]  as its private label credit card already accounted for 27% of its B2C sales in the fourth quarter.\n",
            "[00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:09,400]  Now, let me turn the presentation over to Rosy for financial overview.\n",
            "[00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:16,300]  Hi, good afternoon. Let's start with performance by business.\n",
            "[00:07:17,650 --> 00:07:25,650]  In the fourth quarter of last year, our consolidated revenue grew 13% on a year-on-year basis,\n",
            "[00:07:25,650 --> 00:07:29,940]  mainly driven by MOMO's robust e-commerce business.\n",
            "[00:07:29,940 --> 00:07:32,940]  Mobile service revenue saw a sequential recovery,\n",
            "[00:07:32,940 --> 00:07:40,120]  which helped narrow telecom revenue year-on-year decline to 1% in the quarter.\n",
            "[00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:45,280]  Also, our telecom EBIT recorded year-on-year drops,\n",
            "[00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:52,440]  mainly due to higher subsidies from upselling strategies and longer handset bundle contracts,\n",
            "[00:07:52,440 --> 00:08:00,110]  plummeting roaming business due to travel restrictions and 5G spectrum amortization.\n",
            "[00:08:00,110 --> 00:08:08,110]  For our cable TV business, although fourth quarter EBIT still rose by 5%,\n",
            "[00:08:08,110 --> 00:08:13,110]  the year-on-year decline in DNA further narrowed in the quarter.\n",
            "[00:08:13,110 --> 00:08:21,040]  For investments in broadband and set-top box, MOMO continued on its growth trajectory in the fourth quarter,\n",
            "[00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:26,040]  propelled by its seasonally and structurally strong e-commerce business,\n",
            "[00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:35,320]  posting a 30% surge in revenue and further expanding its EBIT by 42% in the quarter.\n",
            "[00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:38,320]  Now, let's move to results summary.\n",
            "[00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:48,620]  In 2020, consolidated revenue was roughly in line with our forecast,\n",
            "[00:08:48,620 --> 00:08:51,710]  supported by our robust e-commerce business.\n",
            "[00:08:51,710 --> 00:08:55,870]  Despite less operating income in the fourth quarter,\n",
            "[00:08:55,870 --> 00:09:00,610]  our full-year operating income beat the forecast,\n",
            "[00:09:00,610 --> 00:09:04,960]  thanks to XG&A savings and MOMO's contribution.\n",
            "[00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:18,410]  Combined EBIT contribution from MOMO and cable TV reached 28% of our full-year consolidated operating income.\n",
            "[00:09:18,410 --> 00:09:26,140]  For the year 2020, non-operating expenses were significantly below company projections,\n",
            "[00:09:26,140 --> 00:09:34,500]  due mainly to lower-than-expected financing costs along with higher-than-expected dividend income from investees.\n",
            "[00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:40,500]  Net income reached 101% of our full-year 2020 guidance.\n",
            "[00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:44,360]  Let's move on to balance sheet analysis.\n",
            "[00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:54,310]  On the asset front, PB&E rose year-on-year and quarter-on-quarter on the back of the 5G network rollout\n",
            "[00:09:54,310 --> 00:09:58,410]  and land purchase of MOMO's Sutton Distribution Center.\n",
            "[00:10:00,850 --> 00:10:11,850]  The acquisition of 5G spectrum in the first quarter of 2020 resulted in the year-on-year surge in concessions.\n",
            "[00:10:11,850 --> 00:10:23,810]  On the liability front, the healthy operating cash flow generated in the quarter helped us to reduce bank borrowing.\n",
            "[00:10:25,540 --> 00:10:34,540]  The year-on-year rise in net debt to EBITDA was associated with the incremental debt we took on for 5G spectrum acquisition.\n",
            "[00:10:34,540 --> 00:10:43,020]  As for shareholders' equity, the year-on-year and quarter-on-quarter changes in paid-in capital and capital surplus were insignificant,\n",
            "[00:10:43,020 --> 00:10:48,020]  as the majority of our convertible bonds had already been converted.\n",
            "[00:10:48,020 --> 00:10:55,140]  Lastly, let's look at the cash flow analysis on the next slide.\n",
            "[00:10:59,380 --> 00:11:08,380]  The year-on-year surge in fourth quarter operating cash inflow was attributable mainly to a low base from a year ago.\n",
            "[00:11:08,380 --> 00:11:23,470]  As third quarter 2019 payables such as iPhone 11 inventory, merchandise, and tax were postponed to the fourth quarter due to the typhoon holiday.\n",
            "[00:11:23,470 --> 00:11:33,760]  Other than 5G-related capex, the main investing activity in the fourth quarter was the sale of Taiwan High-Speed Rail shares.\n",
            "[00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:46,720]  The year-on-year rise in cash capex reflects our 5G infrastructure rollout, having built around 6,000 base stations by the end of 2020.\n",
            "[00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:54,330]  The difference versus our capex guidance will be paid in 2021.\n",
            "[00:11:54,330 --> 00:12:06,380]  Our full year 2020 free cash flow calculated with pre-IFR 16 operating cash flow was $16.2 billion,\n",
            "[00:12:06,380 --> 00:12:12,380]  translating into a free cash flow yield of 5.8%.\n",
            "[00:12:12,380 --> 00:12:18,250]  Okay, let me turn the presentation back to Jamie for event update and key message.\n",
            "[00:12:18,250 --> 00:12:22,180]  Okay, let's look at page number 14.\n",
            "[00:12:22,180 --> 00:12:30,170]  This page summarizes the awards and recognitions we received during the quarter for your reference.\n",
            "[00:12:30,170 --> 00:12:36,650]  Now, let me walk you through our 2021 guidance on slide number 15.\n",
            "[00:12:36,650 --> 00:12:50,970]  So in 2021, we expect consolidated revenue growth to accelerate to 12 to 15%, up from 6.8% in 2020, lifted by our MOMO and mobile businesses.\n",
            "[00:12:50,970 --> 00:12:57,190]  To ensure growth, we will be investing in mobile subscriber acquisition and retention,\n",
            "[00:12:57,190 --> 00:13:07,700]  focusing on longer-term contracts to lock in ARPU and prevent future churn, along with adding premium cable broadband subscribers.\n",
            "[00:13:07,700 --> 00:13:17,180]  As a result of these investments, we expect combined EBITDA to be flat to slightly down in 2021.\n",
            "[00:13:17,180 --> 00:13:25,180]  Separately, we expect the government's 5G-related subsidies to offset part of our rising 5G DNA,\n",
            "[00:13:25,180 --> 00:13:29,180]  but the benefits will not be significant until 2022.\n",
            "[00:13:29,180 --> 00:13:45,950]  For 2021 capex, a total of NT$11.8 billion was approved by the board, of which telecom capex is to be halved compared to 2020.\n",
            "[00:13:45,950 --> 00:13:56,340]  As we are ahead of the pack in terms of the number of 5G stations running at 3.5 GHz frequency band,\n",
            "[00:13:56,340 --> 00:14:02,340]  cable TV capex is to increase to facilitate cable broadband business growth,\n",
            "[00:14:02,340 --> 00:14:11,770]  and MOMO capex is to rise due to the construction of its new source distribution center.\n",
            "[00:14:11,770 --> 00:14:14,770]  Finally, let's turn to page 16.\n",
            "[00:14:14,770 --> 00:14:21,460]  To wrap up our presentation, here is the key message we would like for you to take away.\n",
            "[00:14:21,460 --> 00:14:30,750]  With MOMO firing on all cylinders and mobile ARPU seeing an uplift from better 5G coverage and more compelling bundles,\n",
            "[00:14:30,750 --> 00:14:35,750]  accelerating top-line growth will be our number one priority in 2021.\n",
            "[00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:43,100]  We believe that this will translate into greater shareholder value in the long term.\n",
            "[00:14:43,100 --> 00:14:50,070]  With that, I would like to open the floor up for Q&A session.\n",
            "[00:14:50,070 --> 00:14:51,070]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:14:51,070 --> 00:14:54,070]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are now polling for questions.\n",
            "[00:14:54,070 --> 00:14:59,070]  If you wish to ask a question, please press star 1 on your telephone touchpad.\n",
            "[00:14:59,070 --> 00:15:00,070]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:15:00,070 --> 00:15:18,370]  Once again, ladies and gentlemen, if you wish to ask a question, please press star 1 on your telephone touchpad.\n",
            "[00:15:18,370 --> 00:15:19,370]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:15:19,370 --> 00:16:02,220]  Once again, ladies and gentlemen, if you wish to ask a question, please press star 1.\n",
            "[00:16:02,220 --> 00:16:03,220]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:16:29,730 --> 00:16:38,790]  Now we have a question that comes from Mr. Xi of SinoPAC.\n",
            "[00:16:38,790 --> 00:16:39,790]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:16:39,790 --> 00:16:45,360]  Thanks for giving me the chance to ask questions.\n",
            "[00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:48,360]  I have two questions.\n",
            "[00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:53,360]  My first question is about the expense.\n",
            "[00:16:54,360 --> 00:17:05,360]  Because now with the situation, we need to record the A32, this can set.\n",
            "[00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:18,220]  Could you give us some kind of about how many, I mean about the expense when we record?\n",
            "[00:17:19,220 --> 00:17:29,900]  How does this record affect the income statement in 2021?\n",
            "[00:17:29,900 --> 00:17:35,900]  Also, is that included in our guidance for 2021?\n",
            "[00:17:35,900 --> 00:17:37,900]  This is my first question.\n",
            "[00:17:37,900 --> 00:17:38,900]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:45,150]  Thank you for the question.\n",
            "[00:17:45,150 --> 00:17:55,500]  So with A32, the recall has been progressing better than we expected.\n",
            "[00:17:55,500 --> 00:18:02,660]  And with most customers opting for pure software update.\n",
            "[00:18:02,660 --> 00:18:12,660]  And on top of that, around 10% of the customers who are opting for phone upgrade,\n",
            "[00:18:13,690 --> 00:18:20,300]  most of them are opting for retention contract with us.\n",
            "[00:18:20,300 --> 00:18:25,300]  With our supplier paying for the additional subsidy.\n",
            "[00:18:25,300 --> 00:18:34,300]  So right now, we are expecting the impact to our income statement to be neutral.\n",
            "[00:18:34,300 --> 00:18:35,970]  Zero.\n",
            "[00:18:35,970 --> 00:18:40,660]  Zero.\n",
            "[00:18:40,660 --> 00:18:51,840]  Yeah, meaning that our supplier will reimburse us for all the claims or the cost associated with the recall.\n",
            "[00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:55,430]  Yes.\n",
            "[00:18:55,430 --> 00:18:56,430]  Okay.\n",
            "[00:18:56,430 --> 00:18:57,430]  Yeah.\n",
            "[00:18:57,430 --> 00:19:07,430]  Okay, my second question is about do we have any target for our 5G subscribers at the end of 2021?\n",
            "[00:19:07,430 --> 00:19:18,430]  And could you give us about do we have any figures about a 5G base station around Taiwan?\n",
            "[00:19:18,430 --> 00:19:22,430]  Do we have any target at the end of 2021?\n",
            "[00:19:22,430 --> 00:19:28,780]  And how many of the base stations have been deployed at the end of 2020?\n",
            "[00:19:28,780 --> 00:19:29,780]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:19:29,780 --> 00:19:43,380]  So in terms of 5G user target, we're observing around a 1 to 1.5% penetration per month pace.\n",
            "[00:19:43,380 --> 00:19:54,900]  And right now, we don't expect that to change course throughout the rest of the year.\n",
            "[00:19:54,900 --> 00:20:07,900]  In terms of the 5G base stations, like Rosie said, we already built close to 6,000 3.5 gigahertz high speed 5G base stations.\n",
            "[00:20:07,900 --> 00:20:11,900]  And we're leading the pack in terms of that deployment.\n",
            "[00:20:11,900 --> 00:20:23,220]  So we don't expect we will be building methodically this year.\n",
            "[00:20:23,220 --> 00:20:38,570]  So could we expect that the coverage in Taiwan with the coverage will above 80% maybe at the end of the next year?\n",
            "[00:20:38,570 --> 00:20:40,370]  Next year.\n",
            "[00:20:40,370 --> 00:20:57,240]  So right now, we're expecting by the end of this year to be covering close to 70% of the traffic.\n",
            "[00:21:01,540 --> 00:21:02,540]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:21:02,540 --> 00:21:03,540]  It's very helpful.\n",
            "[00:21:03,540 --> 00:21:04,540]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:21:04,540 --> 00:21:10,820]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:21:10,820 --> 00:21:14,820]  Our next question comes from Niu of HSBC.\n",
            "[00:21:14,820 --> 00:21:17,360]  Please go ahead, Niu.\n",
            "[00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:18,360]  Thanks.\n",
            "[00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:19,360]  Good afternoon.\n",
            "[00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:20,360]  Two questions, please.\n",
            "[00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:22,360]  The first one relates to the telecom business.\n",
            "[00:21:22,360 --> 00:21:27,360]  And if you could give us any more color on the specific moving parts.\n",
            "[00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:31,360]  So I see you're gliding for revenues up 4% to 6% year on year.\n",
            "[00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:35,360]  And you say your postpaid trend is improving since September.\n",
            "[00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:44,360]  So what's the split this year say between improved postpaid and are you expecting more equipment revenue?\n",
            "[00:21:44,360 --> 00:21:58,620]  And then in terms of the segment EBIT, is it correct to say that there'll be quite a big incremental increase in DNA from your 5G investment in the 5G spectrum?\n",
            "[00:21:58,620 --> 00:22:02,620]  Is that what you expect to drag down the telecom EBIT in 21?\n",
            "[00:22:02,620 --> 00:22:04,620]  And that's my first question.\n",
            "[00:22:04,620 --> 00:22:07,620]  The second one relates to the broader company guidance.\n",
            "[00:22:07,620 --> 00:22:13,620]  And I don't think you're putting out EBIT or net income guidance.\n",
            "[00:22:13,620 --> 00:22:15,620]  I was wondering why that was.\n",
            "[00:22:15,620 --> 00:22:20,300]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:22:20,300 --> 00:22:21,300]  So let me clarify.\n",
            "[00:22:21,300 --> 00:22:27,300]  The first question you're asking are postpaid in terms of percentage of revenue?\n",
            "[00:22:27,300 --> 00:22:34,350]  Well, it's just to get your sense of which way the different moving parts are going in the telecom business.\n",
            "[00:22:34,350 --> 00:22:40,350]  So it seems that you should get quite a good positive effect from 5G adoption through this year.\n",
            "[00:22:40,350 --> 00:22:43,350]  And you said that's already coming through in postpaid.\n",
            "[00:22:43,350 --> 00:22:49,350]  But I guess it sounds like that's going to be offset at the EBIT line by higher DNA.\n",
            "[00:22:49,350 --> 00:22:53,350]  So I was just hoping for more color around that where I've got the right understanding.\n",
            "[00:22:53,350 --> 00:23:17,170]  All right.\n",
            "[00:23:17,170 --> 00:23:24,460]  So in terms of the 4 to 6 percent growth with our telecom business,\n",
            "[00:23:24,460 --> 00:23:31,490]  so it's partly contributed by our output growth and postpaid growth\n",
            "[00:23:31,490 --> 00:23:38,490]  and partly contributed by the expectation that handset sales will grow.\n",
            "[00:23:38,490 --> 00:23:45,490]  So the percentage of customers opting for a handset bundle will be higher.\n",
            "[00:23:45,490 --> 00:23:55,060]  Yes, the DNA will be a headwind to our bottom line.\n",
            "[00:23:55,060 --> 00:24:06,360]  And the reason why we're only giving a guidance is because we're following the international practice.\n",
            "[00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:07,360]  Okay.\n",
            "[00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:08,360]  That's good.\n",
            "[00:24:08,360 --> 00:24:12,420]  Could I ask how you expect telecom?\n",
            "[00:24:12,420 --> 00:24:14,420]  Sorry, that's fine.\n",
            "[00:24:14,420 --> 00:24:15,580]  Okay.\n",
            "[00:24:15,580 --> 00:24:16,580]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:24:16,580 --> 00:24:20,550]  Thank you, Neil.\n",
            "[00:24:20,550 --> 00:24:21,550]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:24:21,550 --> 00:24:27,550]  Ladies and gentlemen, if you have other questions, please press star one on your telephone touchpad.\n",
            "[00:24:27,550 --> 00:24:39,390]  Another question comes from Billy of Credit Suisse.\n",
            "[00:24:39,390 --> 00:24:40,390]  Please go ahead.\n",
            "[00:24:40,390 --> 00:24:45,050]  Thank you for the opportunity.\n",
            "[00:24:45,050 --> 00:24:47,050]  I've got two questions here.\n",
            "[00:24:47,050 --> 00:24:51,050]  The first question is just on the number side.\n",
            "[00:24:51,050 --> 00:24:58,050]  Could you confirm, I didn't get it just now, what is the 5G penetration right now?\n",
            "[00:24:58,050 --> 00:25:04,050]  And then the second question is I also want to get more color from you regarding the output uplift.\n",
            "[00:25:04,050 --> 00:25:11,050]  What was the average output uplift when a 4G customer upgraded to a 5G contract?\n",
            "[00:25:11,050 --> 00:25:14,050]  And I just want to get a better understanding.\n",
            "[00:25:14,050 --> 00:25:15,050]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:25:15,050 --> 00:25:18,680]  Sure, I can repeat that.\n",
            "[00:25:18,680 --> 00:25:27,680]  So by the end of 2020, our 5G penetration amongst all customers would be 6.4%.\n",
            "[00:25:27,680 --> 00:25:31,840]  And amongst postpaid users would be 8%.\n",
            "[00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:49,460]  And when a user upgrades to 5G, the monthly fee lift is on average 24% since launch until the end of 2020.\n",
            "[00:25:49,460 --> 00:25:53,820]  Got it.\n",
            "[00:25:53,820 --> 00:25:54,820]  Very helpful.\n",
            "[00:25:54,820 --> 00:25:55,910]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:25:55,910 --> 00:25:56,910]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:25:56,910 --> 00:25:59,420]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:25:59,420 --> 00:26:03,420]  And our next question comes from Mr. Shi of SinoPAC.\n",
            "[00:26:03,420 --> 00:26:04,420]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:26:06,280 --> 00:26:09,280]  Thanks for giving me another chance to ask questions.\n",
            "[00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:11,280]  I have two questions.\n",
            "[00:26:11,280 --> 00:26:18,280]  My first question is about, we have just mentioned the R2 growth in 2021.\n",
            "[00:26:18,280 --> 00:26:20,280]  Congratulations.\n",
            "[00:26:20,280 --> 00:26:29,280]  And I'm interested, how will the R2 growth in 2021?\n",
            "[00:26:29,280 --> 00:26:34,280]  Is that almost from the 5G cable plan launch?\n",
            "[00:26:34,280 --> 00:26:40,280]  Or are there any other reasons for the growth of the R2 in 2021?\n",
            "[00:26:40,280 --> 00:26:41,280]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:44,490]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:26:44,490 --> 00:26:50,490]  So, yes, one of the main drivers will be customers upgrading to 5G.\n",
            "[00:26:50,490 --> 00:26:58,490]  And like I said, it will produce a 24% monthly fee increase when they do that.\n",
            "[00:26:58,490 --> 00:27:05,490]  On top of that, we're also expecting some of our tech businesses to produce meaningful contributions.\n",
            "[00:27:05,490 --> 00:27:25,160]  So, for example, our game publishing business, in which we work with world-class game developers like Riot to publish their popular title, League of Legends Wild Rift,\n",
            "[00:27:25,160 --> 00:27:34,160]  which already garnered almost 2.5 million monthly active users since the first month.\n",
            "[00:27:34,160 --> 00:27:52,130]  On top of that, our other tech business, such as direct area building, is expected to grow healthily in 2021.\n",
            "[00:27:52,130 --> 00:27:53,130]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:27:53,130 --> 00:27:55,130]  Just one follow-up question.\n",
            "[00:27:55,130 --> 00:28:01,130]  We have just talked about the game business.\n",
            "[00:28:01,130 --> 00:28:11,830]  Could you give us about how many of our revenues related with the game?\n",
            "[00:28:11,830 --> 00:28:14,830]  Do we have any figures?\n",
            "[00:28:14,830 --> 00:28:15,830]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:28:15,830 --> 00:28:17,700]  I'm sorry.\n",
            "[00:28:17,700 --> 00:28:21,700]  At this point, we will not be disclosing that figure.\n",
            "[00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:23,050]  Okay.\n",
            "[00:28:24,590 --> 00:28:36,620]  Could we say it is small now, but this business will grow a lot in the following year, following maybe two or even three years?\n",
            "[00:28:36,620 --> 00:28:38,300]  Yes.\n",
            "[00:28:38,300 --> 00:28:45,300]  Compared with our mobile business, the revenue contribution percentage is not huge.\n",
            "[00:28:45,300 --> 00:28:52,420]  But it will produce a healthy growth momentum for us.\n",
            "[00:28:52,420 --> 00:28:55,120]  Okay.\n",
            "[00:28:56,120 --> 00:29:03,410]  Will the productivity of this kind of business be large or not?\n",
            "[00:29:03,410 --> 00:29:08,410]  Because I'm not quite familiar with this kind of business.\n",
            "[00:29:08,410 --> 00:29:09,890]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:29:15,890 --> 00:29:22,050]  When we look at the game industry, there are games that are short-lived.\n",
            "[00:29:22,050 --> 00:29:27,050]  There are also games that have a really long shelf life.\n",
            "[00:29:27,050 --> 00:29:35,050]  The game that we're publishing with Riot is the mobile version of the League of Legends game.\n",
            "[00:29:35,050 --> 00:29:40,050]  The League of Legends game has been in the market for over a decade.\n",
            "[00:29:40,050 --> 00:29:47,080]  It's still one of the most popular esports games in the world.\n",
            "[00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:59,080]  We're expecting the Wild Rift mobile version to be a relatively long shelf life product.\n",
            "[00:29:59,080 --> 00:30:03,030]  Okay. I see.\n",
            "[00:30:03,030 --> 00:30:08,030]  It's a very good business, and I hope it will grow a lot.\n",
            "[00:30:08,030 --> 00:30:10,030]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:30:10,030 --> 00:30:11,030]  You're welcome.\n",
            "[00:30:11,030 --> 00:30:16,320]  My second question is about Apple growth.\n",
            "[00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:26,960]  Do we have any targets for Apple growth, no matter if it's mobile or KTV?\n",
            "[00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:31,960]  Do we have any targets for Apple in 2021?\n",
            "[00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:36,500]  Yes. Internally, we have very aggressive targets.\n",
            "[00:30:39,050 --> 00:30:47,720]  Unfortunately, we are not disclosing related measures publicly at this point.\n",
            "[00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:57,550]  I see. But will that grow maybe above 10% at least at the end of 2021?\n",
            "[00:30:57,550 --> 00:31:03,220]  I think by that time, we'll take a look.\n",
            "[00:31:03,220 --> 00:31:09,220]  I see. Thank you. It's very helpful.\n",
            "[00:31:09,220 --> 00:31:10,960]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:14,960]  I think in our presentation, we have some clues.\n",
            "[00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:22,960]  We're saying 5G penetration will be 1 to 1.5% per month.\n",
            "[00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:28,990]  Right now, the users upgrading to 5G would produce 24% R-pool lift.\n",
            "[00:31:28,990 --> 00:31:33,990]  I think that's enough clues to make a model around it.\n",
            "[00:31:36,090 --> 00:31:38,530]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:31:38,530 --> 00:31:42,530]  Our next question comes from Curve of Fatality.\n",
            "[00:31:42,530 --> 00:31:43,530]  Please go ahead.\n",
            "[00:31:43,530 --> 00:31:49,140]  Hi, management. Thanks for the opportunity. I hope all is well and happy new year.\n",
            "[00:31:49,140 --> 00:31:55,140]  Just quickly, on your margin guidance, EBITDA guidance, could you help me understand\n",
            "[00:31:55,140 --> 00:32:00,140]  what is the primary reason for EBITDA margin deterioration?\n",
            "[00:32:00,140 --> 00:32:04,140]  Because you're expecting a pretty healthy top-line growth, right?\n",
            "[00:32:04,140 --> 00:32:09,140]  But you're expecting EBITDA to be sluggish almost.\n",
            "[00:32:09,140 --> 00:32:11,140]  Is that because of 5G?\n",
            "[00:32:11,140 --> 00:32:16,140]  Because you're going to have to lift more tower size,\n",
            "[00:32:16,140 --> 00:32:19,140]  and each base station will consume more electricity.\n",
            "[00:32:19,140 --> 00:32:22,140]  Is that a primary reason or something else?\n",
            "[00:32:22,140 --> 00:32:25,730]  Thank you for the question.\n",
            "[00:32:25,730 --> 00:32:28,730]  I think there are two drivers behind it.\n",
            "[00:32:28,730 --> 00:32:36,020]  Number one, if you look at the numbers that we're giving,\n",
            "[00:32:36,020 --> 00:32:40,020]  you can guess that a big portion of the growth\n",
            "[00:32:40,020 --> 00:32:43,020]  will be produced by our e-commerce business,\n",
            "[00:32:43,020 --> 00:32:50,020]  which naturally has a lower EBITDA margin versus our mobile business.\n",
            "[00:32:50,020 --> 00:32:56,050]  On our mobile side, yes, we're going to drive revenue growth\n",
            "[00:32:56,050 --> 00:33:05,210]  through a longer contract and higher R-pool bundle product,\n",
            "[00:33:05,210 --> 00:33:12,210]  which would mean that we would need to put down a higher subsidy right now\n",
            "[00:33:12,210 --> 00:33:17,300]  and reap the benefit two, three years down the road.\n",
            "[00:33:17,300 --> 00:33:22,300]  That will also help us minimize our churn.\n",
            "[00:33:22,300 --> 00:33:26,300]  This year, we're essentially investing for the future.\n",
            "[00:33:26,300 --> 00:33:34,300]  That is why we're not expecting our EBITDA margin to grow as fast as our top-line.\n",
            "[00:33:34,300 --> 00:33:45,320]  But we think that the investment will produce the best longer-term shareholder value.\n",
            "[00:33:45,320 --> 00:33:46,320]  Okay, thank you.\n",
            "[00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:54,320]  My next question is, I guess your management recently mentioned in a newspaper interview\n",
            "[00:33:54,320 --> 00:34:03,320]  that Taobao Mobile is seeking to create Amazon of Southeast Asia or Asia\n",
            "[00:34:03,320 --> 00:34:06,320]  in the next 10 to 15 years.\n",
            "[00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:10,320]  I'd like to better understand what your ambitions about this would be.\n",
            "[00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:15,320]  I mean, would you like to invest as a talent developer,\n",
            "[00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:18,320]  or would you like to make it happen through maybe Momo?\n",
            "[00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:22,320]  Because obviously, Momo has the best e-commerce expertise in Taiwan.\n",
            "[00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:29,320]  How should I understand your investment for the Southeast Asian expansion\n",
            "[00:34:29,320 --> 00:34:33,310]  in terms of e-commerce going forward?\n",
            "[00:34:33,310 --> 00:34:39,310]  Yes, right now, Momo is spearheading our Southeast Asia expansion.\n",
            "[00:34:39,310 --> 00:34:47,310]  They have set up a pretty strong foothold in Thailand,\n",
            "[00:34:47,310 --> 00:34:57,310]  and they are implementing measures there to accelerate their growth in that market.\n",
            "[00:34:57,310 --> 00:35:07,310]  And then, next, Momo will be looking for partners in other major Southeast Asia economies\n",
            "[00:35:07,310 --> 00:35:12,310]  to enter into their B2C e-commerce industries.\n",
            "[00:35:12,310 --> 00:35:15,310]  And right now, if you look at Southeast Asia,\n",
            "[00:35:15,310 --> 00:35:18,310]  they're still in the early days of e-commerce penetration.\n",
            "[00:35:18,310 --> 00:35:23,310]  So, like we talked about in previous conference calls,\n",
            "[00:35:23,310 --> 00:35:27,310]  the economy usually starts from a C2C model,\n",
            "[00:35:27,310 --> 00:35:33,310]  and as the e-commerce markets mature, then there will be a transition into the B2C model.\n",
            "[00:35:33,310 --> 00:35:38,310]  And Momo having an expertise in B2C,\n",
            "[00:35:38,310 --> 00:35:42,310]  they're waiting for the right timing to enter into these markets\n",
            "[00:35:42,310 --> 00:35:47,310]  like Indonesia, Vietnam, or the Philippines with the right partners.\n",
            "[00:35:47,310 --> 00:35:57,540]  And that is our Southeast Asia expansion strategy number one.\n",
            "[00:35:57,540 --> 00:36:02,950]  And then, somewhere in the near future,\n",
            "[00:36:02,950 --> 00:36:11,950]  we'll have other tech business models that will be at the right timing for them to be expanded.\n",
            "[00:36:11,950 --> 00:36:15,950]  Also, following Momo's footsteps across Southeast Asia.\n",
            "[00:36:15,950 --> 00:36:21,950]  And when we are doing that, we'll have more information to share.\n",
            "[00:36:21,950 --> 00:36:25,620]  Okay. Thank you. That's very interesting.\n",
            "[00:36:25,620 --> 00:36:28,620]  And then, related to your tech ambition,\n",
            "[00:36:28,620 --> 00:36:35,620]  do you have any plan to launch, or if you already have any, to enhance your e-wallet strategy?\n",
            "[00:36:35,620 --> 00:36:38,620]  Because one of your competitors, maybe something like Shopee,\n",
            "[00:36:38,620 --> 00:36:42,620]  has been putting a lot of effort to increase e-wallet.\n",
            "[00:36:43,620 --> 00:36:49,620]  I mean, in Taiwan, maybe, or in Southeast Asia, right?\n",
            "[00:36:49,620 --> 00:36:56,620]  And I understand that e-commerce, sorry, credit card penetration in Taiwan is pretty high.\n",
            "[00:36:56,620 --> 00:36:58,620]  So people are not really on that bank.\n",
            "[00:36:58,620 --> 00:37:04,620]  But would you like to sort of put more effort to, you know,\n",
            "[00:37:04,620 --> 00:37:09,620]  enhance your ambition in the e-wallet, or it's not your focus anymore?\n",
            "[00:37:11,550 --> 00:37:25,670]  So we don't think of operating a wallet as the best strategy in terms of serving people's payment needs.\n",
            "[00:37:25,670 --> 00:37:34,700]  We think that users would have different types of payment needs under different scenarios.\n",
            "[00:37:34,700 --> 00:37:40,700]  We want to be there to solve some of them, if it makes sense, both for us and for the customers.\n",
            "[00:37:40,700 --> 00:37:51,960]  So if you look at our direct carrier billing business, it's amongst the largest in Taiwan.\n",
            "[00:37:51,960 --> 00:38:02,960]  And it's essentially solving many of our customers' needs to buy virtual items off Google Play and off App Store\n",
            "[00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:06,960]  when they don't have the proper instruments to pay for them.\n",
            "[00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:10,960]  And it's grown to a pretty significant size.\n",
            "[00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:22,990]  On top of that, we also have the peer-to-peer payment functionalities that we have implemented in our M-Plus Messenger.\n",
            "[00:38:22,990 --> 00:38:31,990]  In terms of payment volume, it's also one of the top players in the market.\n",
            "[00:38:32,990 --> 00:38:37,990]  We don't advertise that, but it solves a very specific need for people,\n",
            "[00:38:37,990 --> 00:38:42,150]  and people are using it, and every month it's growing.\n",
            "[00:38:42,150 --> 00:38:51,180]  So these are two examples of us doing things to solve users' payment needs at the right scenario.\n",
            "[00:38:51,180 --> 00:38:56,180]  Going forward, we're going to implement a few more of these.\n",
            "[00:38:57,180 --> 00:39:04,650]  So far, we don't foresee ourselves running an e-wallet, per se.\n",
            "[00:39:04,650 --> 00:39:05,650]  Thank you. That's very helpful.\n",
            "[00:39:05,650 --> 00:39:12,650]  And maybe if I may, the last question is, how would you describe the current competitive environment for 5G?\n",
            "[00:39:12,650 --> 00:39:18,610]  Is it stable, or do you think differently? Thank you.\n",
            "[00:39:18,610 --> 00:39:28,790]  Thank you. Right now, I would say the 5G competition landscape is less cutthroat than 4G.\n",
            "[00:39:28,790 --> 00:39:32,790]  It's probably partly because of the high entry barriers.\n",
            "[00:39:32,790 --> 00:39:38,790]  So the fact that spectrums were auctioned off at such a high price,\n",
            "[00:39:38,790 --> 00:39:44,820]  and also the base stations' unit prices are higher than 4G,\n",
            "[00:39:44,820 --> 00:39:50,980]  it gives the players less incentive to act irrationally.\n",
            "[00:39:50,980 --> 00:39:55,450]  Thank you. Very helpful.\n",
            "[00:39:55,450 --> 00:39:56,610]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:39:59,820 --> 00:40:06,230]  Thank you. Another question comes from Ryan of UBS. Please go ahead, Ryan.\n",
            "[00:40:06,230 --> 00:40:10,230]  Hi, management. This is Ryan Jin from UBS.\n",
            "[00:40:10,230 --> 00:40:12,230]  Thank you for the opportunity to ask questions.\n",
            "[00:40:12,230 --> 00:40:18,230]  So my first question is on the 5G ARPU uplift of 24% that you just guided.\n",
            "[00:40:18,230 --> 00:40:25,230]  I know that you have just elaborated some of the factors that are leading to the ARPU growth,\n",
            "[00:40:25,230 --> 00:40:30,230]  but do you foresee this 24% being maintained in the coming quarters?\n",
            "[00:40:30,230 --> 00:40:38,230]  I do think that it is kind of higher than what has been previously guided by other peers.\n",
            "[00:40:38,230 --> 00:40:41,230]  I think it was around 10 to 15%.\n",
            "[00:40:41,230 --> 00:40:47,230]  So how should we think about this 24% going into the next few quarters?\n",
            "[00:40:47,230 --> 00:40:52,230]  And my second question is on the partnership with MOMO.\n",
            "[00:40:52,230 --> 00:41:01,230]  I know there may be some opportunity areas for Taiwan Mobile to build a private 5G network\n",
            "[00:41:01,230 --> 00:41:04,230]  in MOMO's warehouses and satellite warehouses.\n",
            "[00:41:04,230 --> 00:41:07,230]  Can we get some updates on that? Thank you.\n",
            "[00:41:07,230 --> 00:41:10,350]  Thank you for the question.\n",
            "[00:41:10,350 --> 00:41:21,560]  So in terms of the staying power of the 24% ARPU lift,\n",
            "[00:41:21,560 --> 00:41:33,100]  it's hard to say at this point because yes, the early adapters would be most interested in signing up\n",
            "[00:41:33,100 --> 00:41:43,200]  for a higher rate plan, but they'll also be coming off from a relatively higher rate plan.\n",
            "[00:41:44,230 --> 00:41:51,330]  So over time as 5G penetrates through the consumer base,\n",
            "[00:41:51,330 --> 00:41:59,330]  you would have people coming off a lower and lower average ARPU.\n",
            "[00:41:59,330 --> 00:42:06,740]  So yes, the absolute number of their new ARPU might be lower than early adapters,\n",
            "[00:42:06,740 --> 00:42:13,840]  but I'm not sure if the percentage difference will be that much different,\n",
            "[00:42:13,840 --> 00:42:17,840]  which is essentially saying maybe the 24% will remain,\n",
            "[00:42:17,840 --> 00:42:22,840]  but it's the absolute numbers that are moving downwards.\n",
            "[00:42:22,840 --> 00:42:31,880]  And then in terms of the MOMO 5G private network partnership,\n",
            "[00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:35,880]  it's been progressing steadily.\n",
            "[00:42:35,880 --> 00:42:48,020]  When we have more progress, we have more milestones that we hit, we'll be sharing them.\n",
            "[00:42:48,020 --> 00:42:49,020]  All right. Thank you.\n",
            "[00:42:49,020 --> 00:42:56,810]  Thank you. Another follow-up question comes from Billy of Credit Suisse.\n",
            "[00:42:56,810 --> 00:43:00,890]  Please go ahead, Billy.\n",
            "[00:43:00,890 --> 00:43:05,890]  Thank you, Jamie and Rosie, for another opportunity to ask questions.\n",
            "[00:43:05,890 --> 00:43:12,890]  May I check, are we having guidance for earnings or EPS and dividend this year?\n",
            "[00:43:12,890 --> 00:43:18,890]  I noticed there isn't an EPS or earnings guidance as we had last year.\n",
            "[00:43:18,890 --> 00:43:21,890]  So just wondering if we have that number.\n",
            "[00:43:21,890 --> 00:43:25,890]  And also what's the outlook for dividend payout? Thank you.\n",
            "[00:43:25,890 --> 00:43:37,860]  Well, we don't have guidance on EPS anymore to follow international practice\n",
            "[00:43:37,860 --> 00:43:39,860]  just as Jamie mentioned.\n",
            "[00:43:39,860 --> 00:43:45,860]  And on EPS, it will be decided by the board every April.\n",
            "[00:43:45,860 --> 00:43:50,150]  So I have nothing to share with you.\n",
            "[00:43:50,150 --> 00:43:56,150]  As you all know that we are very committal to a very stable dividend policy.\n",
            "[00:43:56,150 --> 00:44:02,470]  Okay. Got it. Thank you.\n",
            "[00:44:02,470 --> 00:44:06,260]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:44:06,260 --> 00:44:09,260]  Ladies and gentlemen, if you have other questions,\n",
            "[00:44:09,260 --> 00:44:13,260]  please press star 1 on your telephone touchpad.\n",
            "[00:44:13,260 --> 00:44:24,420]  Once again, ladies and gentlemen, if you have other questions,\n",
            "[00:44:24,420 --> 00:44:27,420]  please press star 1. Thank you.\n",
            "[00:44:27,420 --> 00:44:51,540]  Jamie and Rosie, there's another question comes from Karp of Fidelity.\n",
            "[00:44:51,540 --> 00:44:52,540]  Please go ahead.\n",
            "[00:44:52,540 --> 00:44:56,780]  Sorry, if you don't want to ask another question.\n",
            "[00:44:56,780 --> 00:44:58,780]  Just a technical question.\n",
            "[00:44:58,780 --> 00:45:02,780]  How do you account for government subsidies going forward?\n",
            "[00:45:02,780 --> 00:45:06,780]  I mean, will that be subtracted from your ‚Äì yeah.\n",
            "[00:45:06,780 --> 00:45:12,780]  So I just want to better understand how government subsidies will affect your financial statement,\n",
            "[00:45:12,780 --> 00:45:19,780]  especially P&L, because it's going to affect ‚Äì it may affect depreciation expenses, etc., etc.\n",
            "[00:45:19,780 --> 00:45:20,780]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:45:20,780 --> 00:45:35,600]  Well, it will be booked in our revenues.\n",
            "[00:45:35,600 --> 00:45:47,040]  Other operating income as part of our ‚Äì well, anyway, other operating income for sure.\n",
            "[00:45:47,040 --> 00:45:50,040]  Okay. So you will invest, right?\n",
            "[00:45:50,040 --> 00:45:58,040]  So you will do CapEx, and then you will just recognize depreciation from that investment,\n",
            "[00:45:58,040 --> 00:46:05,390]  and temporarily you just book government subsidies in the P&L.\n",
            "[00:46:05,390 --> 00:46:10,390]  Yes, the government subsidies will be booked into other operating income.\n",
            "[00:46:10,390 --> 00:46:17,390]  You can think of it as a deduction item to the DNA.\n",
            "[00:46:17,390 --> 00:46:22,510]  Okay. Okay. Thank you. That's really helpful.\n",
            "[00:46:22,510 --> 00:46:29,510]  And then my last question is how do you think about network sharing with other operators going forward?\n",
            "[00:46:29,510 --> 00:46:34,510]  I mean, obviously, now, Apari is tied up with APT,\n",
            "[00:46:34,510 --> 00:46:41,510]  and do you think it makes sense to do network sharing with someone else,\n",
            "[00:46:41,510 --> 00:46:46,510]  or are you happy with the current situation? Thank you.\n",
            "[00:46:46,510 --> 00:47:00,180]  In the long run, we think, yes, it will make economic sense to do network sharing with the right partners.\n",
            "[00:47:00,180 --> 00:47:07,180]  Right now, we're not engaged in any of such discussions,\n",
            "[00:47:07,180 --> 00:47:11,180]  and we're pretty happy with how things are going so far.\n",
            "[00:47:11,180 --> 00:47:17,180]  Like I said, we led the pack in terms of 3.5 gigahertz high-speed 5G rollout,\n",
            "[00:47:17,180 --> 00:47:21,180]  and we're also leading in terms of 5G penetration.\n",
            "[00:47:22,180 --> 00:47:32,340]  So the fact that we can move rather quickly right now,\n",
            "[00:47:32,340 --> 00:47:38,460]  I think it's also beneficiary in the beginning of the rollout.\n",
            "[00:47:38,460 --> 00:47:44,390]  Okay. Thank you. Very helpful.\n",
            "[00:47:44,390 --> 00:47:45,390]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:47:45,390 --> 00:47:50,390]  Ladies and gentlemen, if you have other questions, please press star 1.\n",
            "[00:47:50,390 --> 00:47:51,390]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:47:51,390 --> 00:48:04,280]  Once again, it's star 1 to ask a question.\n",
            "[00:48:04,280 --> 00:48:08,630]  There comes Mr. Xi who has another question from SinoPAC.\n",
            "[00:48:08,630 --> 00:48:11,050]  Please go ahead.\n",
            "[00:48:11,050 --> 00:48:13,050]  Thank you for giving me another chance to ask a question.\n",
            "[00:48:13,050 --> 00:48:15,050]  I have one question.\n",
            "[00:48:15,050 --> 00:48:24,050]  Because we just gave the whole year guidance, could you give us the quarter guidance,\n",
            "[00:48:24,050 --> 00:48:31,050]  maybe the first quarter or the first half of the year's revenue guidance?\n",
            "[00:48:33,080 --> 00:48:34,080]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:48:37,290 --> 00:48:43,620]  We don't do quarterly guidance now.\n",
            "[00:48:43,620 --> 00:48:50,840]  Okay. Got it. Thank you.\n",
            "[00:48:50,840 --> 00:48:51,840]  Thank you.\n",

            "[00:48:56,840 --> 00:49:12,140]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:49:12,140 --> 00:49:17,460]  Jamie and Rosie, there seems to be no other questions online.\n",
            "[00:49:17,460 --> 00:49:20,460]  Okay. If that's the case, thanks for tuning in.\n",
            "[00:49:20,460 --> 00:49:21,460]  Happy New Year.\n",
            "[00:49:21,460 --> 00:49:26,460]  We wish you have a very good bull year doing this bull market,\n",
            "[00:49:26,460 --> 00:49:29,460]  and we'll speak to you at our next conference.\n",
            "[00:49:29,460 --> 00:49:30,460]  Thank you.\n",

            "[00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:41,280]  areas they go to. And right now, based on our own in-house estimate, we have built the most\n",

            "[00:21:31,340 --> 00:21:36,380]  Thank you. Just one quick follow-up. So the 6,000 is the target for 2020?\n",

            "[00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:05,440]  Hi. Thank you, Janie and Rosie. I've got two quick questions. First one is a follow-up on\n",
            "[00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:14,960]  base stations. So you said 6,000 is the target for this year, and how many 5G base stations do\n",
            "[00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:21,440]  we have right now? So that's the first question. And the second question also relates to CAPEX.\n",
            "[00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:28,000]  I noticed across the first nine months, the cash CAPEX is just roughly $5 billion.\n",
            "[00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:36,080]  This looks quite small when you compare with the overall full year CAPEX guidance. So does that\n",
            "[00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:43,580]  imply there will be around like 15 billion CAPEX coming in the fourth quarter? Thank you.\n",
            "[00:22:46,050 --> 00:22:53,170]  Thank you, David. So like I said, we have built almost 4,000 3.5 gigahertz 5G,\n",
            "[00:22:53,170 --> 00:22:59,090]  high-speed 5G base stations. That is much more than any of our peers. So some of the peers would\n",

            "[00:23:07,570 --> 00:23:14,850]  5G base stations. So if you would compare Apple to Apple, only 3.5 gigahertz high-speed 5G stations,\n",
            "[00:23:15,810 --> 00:23:23,330]  we have almost 4,000. That is the most than all of our peers and by far. And towards the end of\n",
            "[00:23:23,330 --> 00:23:31,010]  the year, we intend to build close to 6,000 3.5 gigahertz 5G stations. In terms of CAPEX, I'll\n",
            "[00:23:31,010 --> 00:23:41,360]  have Rosy explain a little bit. Well, as you know that the rollout is continuing. So the payment\n",
            "[00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:52,880]  will also be continuing. It will be slightly later. Maybe some of them will be delayed until\n",
            "[00:23:52,880 --> 00:24:05,040]  early next year. Okay. Thank you. Thank you. Our next question comes from Jeff Xu with\n",
            "[00:24:05,040 --> 00:24:16,690]  Sinopad Taipei. Just go ahead. Thank you. Yes. Sorry, could you hear me? Loud and clear.\n",
            "[00:24:19,170 --> 00:24:26,290]  Okay. I have two questions. Also, thanks for giving me a chance. The first question is about\n",
            "[00:24:27,010 --> 00:24:37,170]  do we have any of our 5G customer target in the end of 2020 and 2021? This is my first question.\n",
            "[00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:53,520]  My second question is about because I was informed that the 5G base station will need more power,\n",
            "[00:24:54,240 --> 00:25:03,840]  need more electricity in comparison with the 4G. So will the electricity fees,\n",
            "[00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:10,800]  will the electricity expense will be higher in comparison with the 4G era?\n",
            "[00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:16,080]  And how will we control this kind of expense over the\n",
            "[00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:30,590]  cost? Thank you. Thank you, Jeff. So we do have a 5G customer target, but we're not\n",
            "[00:25:30,750 --> 00:25:42,350]  ‚Äì we're not sharing the number for now. All I can say is we're ‚Äì like we said, we're\n",
            "[00:25:43,780 --> 00:25:51,470]  ahead of 4G era in terms of penetration, and we expect it to remain the case\n",
            "[00:25:53,870 --> 00:25:58,750]  throughout the rest of the year. In terms of electricity consumption, yes,\n",
            "[00:26:01,300 --> 00:26:09,220]  with 5G base stations operating live, it will increase the cost of electricity for us.\n",
            "[00:26:11,730 --> 00:26:20,510]  Exactly how much it will increase, I think, with the rhetoric, keep it confidential information.\n",
            "[00:26:20,510 --> 00:26:24,590]  Okay, I see. And just another follow-up question is about also\n",
            "[00:26:26,350 --> 00:26:32,830]  now and will we change our financial forecast in 2020? Thank you.\n",

            "[00:27:56,060 --> 00:28:03,140]  go ahead. Thank you. Thank you. Maybe just two questions. The first one is that previously\n",
            "[00:28:03,620 --> 00:28:12,900]  in a call, we mentioned like 5G spending is 25% higher. So, would you please elaborate more? So,\n",
            "[00:28:12,900 --> 00:28:21,060]  what's the comparison? Is it for the same customer? It's 5G spending versus previously when\n",
            "[00:28:21,060 --> 00:28:28,420]  he or she was on a 4G plan? And second question is that what's your longer view on the market\n",
            "[00:28:28,740 --> 00:28:34,900]  dynamic? So, it seems competition remains rational so far. So, going into 5G,\n",
            "[00:28:35,460 --> 00:28:40,660]  what other factors do you think will drive, say, change in the market share?\n",
            "[00:28:44,130 --> 00:28:52,290]  Thank you, Sarah. So, when we talk about 25% monthly fee lift, yes, it's existing customer\n",
            "[00:28:52,290 --> 00:28:59,250]  renewing his or her contract from a 4G contract to a 5G contract. We're seeing overall on average\n",
            "[00:29:01,090 --> 00:29:08,050]  it would mean a 25% increase in their monthly fee. In terms of the competitive\n",
            "[00:29:08,050 --> 00:29:16,510]  landscape in a longer run, we feel that it looks like things are cooling down,\n",
            "[00:29:18,430 --> 00:29:26,700]  especially with a smaller operator working closely with one of the major operators.\n",
            "[00:29:27,260 --> 00:29:34,860]  So, but things like this is really hard to predict. Generally, we feel that over the next\n",
            "[00:29:34,860 --> 00:29:41,820]  three to five years, it looks like things will be a lot more rationalized than before.\n",
            "[00:29:46,060 --> 00:29:48,740]  Got it. Thank you. Thank you, Sarah.\n",

            "[00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:30,560]  Also, thank you for another chance to ask questions. I have one question. My question\n",
            "[00:30:30,560 --> 00:30:41,760]  is about if the iPhone subsidy, I mean the 5G iPhone subsidy will be higher than the 4G iPhone?\n",
            "[00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:50,080]  This is my question. Thank you. Thank you, Jeff. So, it depends on\n",
            "[00:30:51,280 --> 00:31:03,920]  which plan the customer chooses. If it's a shorter period contract, then it's similar.\n",
            "[00:31:03,920 --> 00:31:09,760]  But if he or she chooses a longer period contract, for example, the 48-month program,\n",
            "[00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:13,920]  then, of course, it's going to be higher. But then the subsidy will also be‚Ä¶\n",
            "[00:31:15,920 --> 00:31:20,160]  You can also view the subsidy as being spread out through a longer period.\n",
            "[00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:37,360]  Okay. Sorry, I just want to clarify. We use almost the same period. 5G iPhone subsidy will\n",
            "[00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:48,560]  be higher than the 4G iPhone. Thank you. So, for the Apple to Apple comparison,\n",
            "[00:31:48,560 --> 00:31:54,960]  then the subsidy is very similar. Okay. I see. Thank you. It's very helpful.\n",
            "[00:31:55,920 --> 00:32:02,020]  Thank you. Thank you. Once again, ladies and gentlemen, if you'd like to register for questions,\n",

            "[00:33:09,890 --> 00:33:23,250]  Okay. So, for 5G customers, around 90% of them chose 99 or up plans, and then 58% of them chose\n",
            "[00:33:23,970 --> 00:33:33,980]  1399 and up plans. And I don't think we're disclosing that number for the entire user base.\n",
            "[00:33:36,060 --> 00:33:52,460]  Okay. So, you mean that 99% is about 99% and so 59% chose 1399%. Is that correct?\n",
            "[00:33:53,420 --> 00:34:01,900]  Around 90% chose the 999 plus, and then 58% chose 1399 plus.\n",

            "[00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:35,200]  customers' anticipation for more 5G phones to be unveiled,\n",
            "[00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:41,200]  and to a lesser extent, impact on international roaming revenue caused by COVID travel restrictions.\n",
            "[00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:46,680]  On the other hand, our 5G infrastructure build-out continued seamlessly,\n",
            "[00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:54,780]  and as a result, we were one of the first Taiwanese carriers to launch commercial 5G services successfully\n",
            "[00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:58,130]  at midnight on July the 1st.\n",
            "[00:01:58,130 --> 00:02:02,480]  I want to take a moment to thank all of our telecom business team members.\n",
            "[00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:07,480]  They worked relentlessly and cohesively for months to make it happen.\n",
            "[00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:10,480]  Kudos to all of them.\n",
            "[00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:15,770]  As for MoMo, it once again delivered a stellar quarter.\n",
            "[00:02:15,770 --> 00:02:19,770]  As online shopping continued to thrive in this new normal.\n",
            "[00:02:19,770 --> 00:02:25,930]  Overall, our net income arrived 4% ahead of our second quarter guidance.\n",
            "[00:02:25,930 --> 00:02:31,930]  On a pre-IFRS basis, net income remained flat Y01 in the quarter.\n",
            "[00:02:31,930 --> 00:02:37,020]  It's also worth mentioning that operating cash flow stabilized as well.\n",
            "[00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:43,790]  Now, let's turn to page five for a closer look at our telecom business.\n",
            "[00:02:43,790 --> 00:02:48,790]  In the second quarter, our double play, or in Chinese, Hao Su Cheng Shuang,\n",
            "[00:02:48,790 --> 00:02:52,790]  mobile plus home broadband bundle continued to gain traction,\n",
            "[00:02:52,790 --> 00:02:55,790]  providing healthy lift to our output mix.\n",
            "[00:02:55,790 --> 00:03:01,530]  On the enterprise side, demand for IoT connectivity remained solid,\n",
            "[00:03:01,530 --> 00:03:05,880]  yielding 40% Y01 increase in the quarter.\n",
            "[00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:12,880]  The enterprise fixed services, which accounted for close to 10% of our telecom service revenue,\n",
            "[00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:15,880]  posted a healthy 6% Y01 growth.\n",
            "[00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:22,170]  At the same time, cloud ICT and IoT revenues grew by 35% Y01.\n",
            "[00:03:22,170 --> 00:03:27,710]  Now, let's turn to page six for an update on our cable TV business.\n",
            "[00:03:27,710 --> 00:03:33,900]  During the second quarter, we continued to fare better than our MSO peers\n",
            "[00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:40,930]  in terms of decline in basic TV subscriptions and higher broadband and DTV penetration.\n",
            "[00:03:40,930 --> 00:03:43,930]  As customers demand faster broadband speeds,\n",
            "[00:03:43,930 --> 00:03:48,930]  the percentage of our subscribers using 100 megabits and higher plans\n",
            "[00:03:48,930 --> 00:03:52,930]  grew by 6 percentage points from a year ago.\n",
            "[00:03:52,930 --> 00:04:03,280]  On the financial side, with 33% Y01 decline in depreciation and amortization EBIT,\n",
            "[00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:09,280]  I'm sorry, with 33% Y01 decline in depreciation and amortization,\n",
            "[00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:15,280]  EBIT posted a 7% Y01 increase in the second quarter.\n",
            "[00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:23,840]  Last but not least, let's take a look at our growth engine, MOMO, on slide seven.\n",
            "[00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:26,840]  Despite a traditionally slower second quarter,\n",
            "[00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:34,940]  MOMO's e-commerce business continued to outgrow its peers and delivered strong results.\n",
            "[00:04:34,940 --> 00:04:40,970]  Not only did the total number of transactions jump by close to 40% Y01,\n",
            "[00:04:40,970 --> 00:04:43,970]  averaged ticket size also edged higher,\n",
            "[00:04:43,970 --> 00:04:48,320]  with its private label credit card serving as a tailwind.\n",
            "[00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:54,740]  On the logistics side, MOMO further added two satellite warehouses in the second quarter,\n",
            "[00:04:54,740 --> 00:05:01,740]  taking its total number of satellite warehouses to 17, which is nine more than a year ago.\n",
            "[00:05:01,740 --> 00:05:10,090]  Coupled with its build-out of in-house delivery fleet, MOMO continues to cut short delivery time\n",
            "[00:05:10,090 --> 00:05:14,090]  and that in turn helps MOMO further widen its mold.\n",
            "[00:05:14,090 --> 00:05:18,820]  At the same time, thanks to increasing scale and operating leverage,\n",
            "[00:05:18,820 --> 00:05:25,110]  MOMO's e-commerce EBIT surged by 50% Y01 in the second quarter.\n",

            "[00:05:33,650 --> 00:05:38,740]  Let's start with performance by business on page nine.\n",
            "[00:05:39,740 --> 00:05:48,030]  In the second quarter of this year, our consolidated revenue once again grew on a Y01 basis,\n",
            "[00:05:48,030 --> 00:05:50,450]  mainly driven by MOMO,\n",
            "[00:05:50,450 --> 00:05:56,740]  which accounted for more than half of the company's consolidated revenue for the first time.\n",
            "[00:05:56,740 --> 00:05:59,740]  Telecom revenue and EBIT, on the other hand,\n",
            "[00:05:59,740 --> 00:06:04,740]  recorded deeper year-on-year declines than the previous quarter,\n",
            "[00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:07,740]  mainly due to soft handset bundle sales.\n",
            "[00:06:07,740 --> 00:06:12,470]  While cable TV EBIT declined year-on-year in second quarter,\n",
            "[00:06:12,470 --> 00:06:17,470]  mainly attributable to competition in basic TV business,\n",
            "[00:06:17,470 --> 00:06:20,470]  its EBIT rose by 7% year-on-year,\n",
            "[00:06:20,470 --> 00:06:26,630]  which was a function of the falling depreciation of set-up boxes.\n",
            "[00:06:26,630 --> 00:06:30,980]  So let's move to result summary on page 10.\n",
            "[00:06:30,980 --> 00:06:39,320]  In the second quarter, the 16% year-on-year increase in the combined operating income\n",
            "[00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:46,320]  of cable TV and MOMO helped mitigate the slide in telecom operating income.\n",
            "[00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:52,610]  If we strip out the IFR bundle sales adjustment swing factors,\n",
            "[00:06:52,610 --> 00:06:56,610]  second quarter net income remained stable year-on-year.\n",
            "[00:06:56,610 --> 00:07:04,150]  In the first half of this year, while total revenue was slightly behind,\n",
            "[00:07:05,150 --> 00:07:11,150]  the muted telecom performance was offset by lower selling expenses\n",
            "[00:07:11,150 --> 00:07:15,500]  and MOMO's operating leverage at the operating income level.\n",
            "[00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:24,140]  Overall, operating income for all major businesses achieved management expectations.\n",
            "[00:07:24,140 --> 00:07:29,870]  Non-operating expenses tracked well below expectations.\n",
            "[00:07:29,870 --> 00:07:35,870]  On account of higher-than-expected equity income disposal gains realized by MOMO\n",
            "[00:07:35,870 --> 00:07:39,540]  and lower-than-expected financing costs.\n",
            "[00:07:39,540 --> 00:07:45,540]  Now let's move to balance sheet analysis on page 11.\n",
            "[00:07:45,540 --> 00:07:51,730]  On the asset side, the year-on-year surge in concessions\n",
            "[00:07:51,730 --> 00:07:56,730]  resulted from the acquisition of 5G spectrum in the first quarter of this year\n",
            "[00:07:56,730 --> 00:08:04,400]  has begun amortization since the commercial launch on July 1, 2020.\n",
            "[00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:12,430]  On the liability front, gross debt dropped to $62 billion at the end of the second quarter,\n",
            "[00:08:12,430 --> 00:08:17,910]  following $5 billion repayment of short-term borrowing.\n",
            "[00:08:17,910 --> 00:08:25,010]  Net debt to EBITDA also declined sequentially to 1.68 times in the second quarter.\n",
            "[00:08:25,010 --> 00:08:30,360]  As for shareholders' equity, the quarter-on-quarter decline in second quarter\n",
            "[00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:35,160]  was a result of AGM's approval to pay dividends.\n",
            "[00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:41,340]  Lastly, let's look at cash flow analysis on page 12.\n",
            "[00:08:41,340 --> 00:08:46,340]  In the second quarter, the year-on-year increase in operating cash flow\n",
            "[00:08:46,340 --> 00:08:49,340]  was a result of MOMO's rising payables.\n",
            "[00:08:49,340 --> 00:08:56,700]  On a sequential basis, operating cash flow fell as we paid 2019 corporate taxes\n",
            "[00:08:56,700 --> 00:08:57,700]  in the second quarter.\n",
            "[00:08:57,700 --> 00:09:03,370]  As for investing cash outflow, apart from CAPEX,\n",
            "[00:09:03,370 --> 00:09:09,370]  the main activity in the second quarter was the sale of Taiwan High-Speed Rail shares.\n",
            "[00:09:09,370 --> 00:09:15,530]  75 million shares remained to be disposed of as of the end of the second quarter.\n",
            "[00:09:15,530 --> 00:09:23,060]  On the financing front, net cash outflow mainly came from debt repayment\n",
            "[00:09:23,060 --> 00:09:28,060]  and cash dividend payment to MOMO's minority shareholders in the second quarter.\n",
            "[00:09:28,060 --> 00:09:35,180]  The rise in cash CAPEX was due to the expansion of MOMO's logistics capability.\n",
            "[00:09:35,180 --> 00:09:42,050]  Second quarter pre-cash flow calculated with pre-I-5-16 operating cash flow\n",
            "[00:09:42,050 --> 00:09:45,050]  reached 4.6 billion NT dollars,\n",
            "[00:09:45,050 --> 00:09:52,500]  translating into an analyzed pre-cash flow yield of 5.9%.\n",
            "[00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:57,500]  Let me turn the presentation back to Jamie for event updates and key messages.\n",
            "[00:09:57,500 --> 00:09:58,500]  Thank you, Rosie.\n",
            "[00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:00,500]  So let's turn to page 14.\n",
            "[00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:06,500]  As mentioned earlier, Taiwan's biggest commercial 5G service is on July 1st.\n",
            "[00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:10,500]  This page also summarizes the awards and recognitions we received\n",
            "[00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:14,040]  during the quarter for your reference.\n",
            "[00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:17,040]  And finally, to wrap up our presentation,\n",
            "[00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:21,900]  here's a key message we would like for you to take away.\n",
            "[00:10:21,900 --> 00:10:27,900]  Taiwan's big three mobile operators have entered the new era with restrained pricing\n",
            "[00:10:27,900 --> 00:10:36,060]  and a consensus on 5G unlimited data plans starting from NT$1,399 a month.\n",
            "[00:10:36,060 --> 00:10:42,610]  As 5G iPhone and the likes arrive alongside continuous network build-out,\n",
            "[00:10:42,610 --> 00:10:46,610]  we expect 5G service adoptions to accelerate,\n",
            "[00:10:46,610 --> 00:10:51,610]  and hence increase bundle sales of high-end phones for telecom business.\n",
            "[00:10:51,610 --> 00:10:58,020]  At the same time, we expect MOMO to continue to thrive in this new normal\n",
            "[00:10:58,020 --> 00:11:06,020]  and its investments into logistics should give it increasing advantage over its peers.\n",
            "[00:11:06,020 --> 00:11:10,020]  With that, I would like to now open the floor up for Q&A.\n",
            "[00:11:10,020 --> 00:11:11,020]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:11:11,020 --> 00:11:15,100]  Thank you, Jamie and Rosie.\n",
            "[00:11:15,100 --> 00:11:18,100]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are now polling for questions.\n",
            "[00:11:18,100 --> 00:11:23,100]  If you wish to ask a question, please press star 1 on your telephone touchpad.\n",
            "[00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:24,100]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:32,420]  And we now have the first question come from Miu of HSBC.\n",
            "[00:11:32,420 --> 00:11:33,420]  Please go ahead, Miu.\n",
            "[00:11:33,420 --> 00:11:35,220]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:11:35,220 --> 00:11:37,220]  Good afternoon, Rosie and Jamie.\n",
            "[00:11:37,220 --> 00:11:39,220]  Just a question on MOMO, if I may.\n",
            "[00:11:39,220 --> 00:11:45,220]  You mentioned cash capex is up because of investment in distribution, I think, and fulfillment.\n",
            "[00:11:45,220 --> 00:11:51,220]  Can you give any more color and comment about how that might look over the next couple of years\n",
            "[00:11:51,220 --> 00:11:53,220]  given the demand you're seeing at the moment,\n",
            "[00:11:53,220 --> 00:11:57,220]  and also anything else from the competitive environment relating to MOMO?\n",
            "[00:11:57,220 --> 00:11:58,220]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:12:08,730 --> 00:12:16,020]  Cash capex, actually, for MOMO is there already,\n",
            "[00:12:16,020 --> 00:12:26,240]  and they expect to have greater plans for logistics expansion down the road.\n",
            "[00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:34,140]  So cash capex may be increasing for MOMO.\n",
            "[00:12:34,140 --> 00:12:35,140]  Thank you, Rosie.\n",
            "[00:12:35,140 --> 00:12:41,140]  In terms of competitive landscape, like we expressed during our presentation,\n",
            "[00:12:41,140 --> 00:12:46,140]  we think MOMO is right now in a virtuous circle.\n",
            "[00:12:46,140 --> 00:12:53,140]  So as they invest into shortening their delivery time and their logistics network,\n",
            "[00:12:53,140 --> 00:12:58,140]  it's going to lend to their competitive advantage over its peers.\n",
            "[00:12:58,140 --> 00:13:05,140]  We continue to see MOMO performing better than the sector as a whole.\n",
            "[00:13:05,140 --> 00:13:08,830]  Got it. Thank you.\n",
            "[00:13:08,830 --> 00:13:11,830]  Rosie, just on the investment in the capex,\n",
            "[00:13:11,830 --> 00:13:15,830]  would you characterize that as sort of fairly lumpy,\n",
            "[00:13:15,830 --> 00:13:19,830]  so big investments in distribution, fulfillment centers, and then a period of stability,\n",
            "[00:13:19,830 --> 00:13:25,830]  or is it more like a stable capital intensity relating to this part of the business?\n",
            "[00:13:25,830 --> 00:13:33,690]  I think they have their plans,\n",
            "[00:13:33,690 --> 00:13:41,690]  and currently we probably wouldn't be able to comment because they have their plans,\n",
            "[00:13:41,690 --> 00:13:49,690]  and if they have more country plans, they will bring it up for board approval.\n",
            "[00:13:50,690 --> 00:13:57,690]  Currently, in our guidance, it's already reflected what they have for this year.\n",
            "[00:13:57,690 --> 00:14:03,320]  So that's currently what we have for the moment.\n",
            "[00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:09,320]  For the longer term, I think we expect MOMO to continue to invest into logistics\n",
            "[00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:18,860]  because that will continue to provide them with long-term competitive advantage\n",
            "[00:14:18,860 --> 00:14:20,860]  over their peers, like we said.\n",
            "[00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:24,180]  Understood. Thanks very much.\n",
            "[00:14:24,180 --> 00:14:29,050]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:14:29,050 --> 00:14:33,270]  Ladies and gentlemen, if you have other questions, please press star 1.\n",
            "[00:14:33,270 --> 00:14:39,430]  And we have another question. It comes from Amber of Yanta. Please go ahead.\n",
            "[00:14:39,430 --> 00:14:43,830]  Hi. Two questions here.\n",
            "[00:14:43,830 --> 00:14:49,830]  I saw Pierre shared with us their current 5G adoption progress\n",
            "[00:14:49,830 --> 00:14:53,830]  and their target for 5G penetration.\n",
            "[00:14:53,830 --> 00:14:58,830]  Just wondering if Talon Mobile has similar information and can share with us.\n",
            "[00:14:58,830 --> 00:15:03,830]  And secondly, I also want to have an update on your CapEx outlook\n",
            "[00:15:03,830 --> 00:15:07,830]  for the mobile business for the coming years. Thank you.\n",
            "[00:15:07,830 --> 00:15:11,620]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:15:11,620 --> 00:15:18,620]  So in terms of 5G adoption and 5G adoption progress, I think it's still early in the game,\n",
            "[00:15:18,620 --> 00:15:26,620]  so we prefer to address the question somewhere down the road.\n",
            "[00:15:26,620 --> 00:15:35,620]  In terms of our target, we have expressed that we aim to convert more than half of our subscriber base\n",
            "[00:15:35,620 --> 00:15:39,620]  to 5G in a window of three years.\n",
            "[00:15:39,620 --> 00:15:43,840]  In terms of CapEx outlook, I'll let Rosalie speak to it.\n",
            "[00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:59,840]  So for the CapEx for the coming years, we will share with you after the first board meeting every year.\n",
            "[00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:07,880]  So currently, I think we'll just stick to our guidance.\n",
            "[00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:14,160]  Okay. Thank you.\n",
            "[00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:15,160]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:26,720]  Ladies and gentlemen, if you have other questions, please press star 1.\n",
            "[00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:32,580]  We had a question come from Jack of SinoPAC. Please go ahead, Jack.\n",
            "[00:16:43,690 --> 00:16:44,690]  I'm sorry, Jack.\n",
            "[00:16:44,690 --> 00:16:48,690]  Jack, can you get closer to the microphone? We are having some difficulties hearing you.\n",
            "[00:16:48,690 --> 00:16:52,480]  Is that clear?\n",
            "[00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:53,480]  A little bit better.\n",
            "[00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:59,460]  Okay. I'll just move it a little closer.\n",
            "[00:16:59,460 --> 00:17:04,460]  So my first question is about our strategy about a double trade.\n",
            "[00:17:04,460 --> 00:17:10,460]  So it seems to have a good impact for our revenue.\n",
            "[00:17:10,460 --> 00:17:17,460]  But we also see our competitors, whether it's Zhonghua or Baisheng,\n",
            "[00:17:17,460 --> 00:17:24,560]  they also have similar strategies.\n",
            "[00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:34,560]  So what are the key points for their strategy and how will we do for their strategy?\n",
            "[00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:35,560]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:38,510]  Thank you, Jack.\n",
            "[00:17:38,510 --> 00:17:45,510]  So I think double trade, like we said, it's been providing a healthy tailwind to our pool mix.\n",
            "[00:17:45,510 --> 00:17:55,510]  And in terms of other telecom companies trying to offer similar programs,\n",
            "[00:17:55,510 --> 00:17:57,510]  we're very happy to see that.\n",
            "[00:17:57,510 --> 00:18:04,510]  I think it's going to be good for us and our peers.\n",
            "[00:18:04,510 --> 00:18:07,510]  So I think it's good for the industry as a whole.\n",
            "[00:18:07,510 --> 00:18:16,950]  So we have no problem with our peers trying to put together similar programs.\n",
            "[00:18:17,950 --> 00:18:39,620]  So when they take the similar strategies, will the company worry this new strategy will have a negative impact for the TWN?\n",
            "[00:18:39,620 --> 00:18:46,620]  So right now, if you look at the industry as a whole, churn rate is at historical low for everybody.\n",
            "[00:18:46,620 --> 00:18:54,620]  So I think for most of us, it's mainly how we serve our existing customer base better\n",
            "[00:18:54,620 --> 00:19:01,620]  and offer them the products they wanted so that we can increase our pool.\n",
            "[00:19:01,620 --> 00:19:08,620]  So I think our double play is mostly for existing customers.\n",
            "[00:19:08,620 --> 00:19:15,620]  And if Zhonghua or FET would like to offer similar programs to their existing customers,\n",
            "[00:19:15,620 --> 00:19:18,650]  I think we're totally happy to see that.\n",
            "[00:19:18,650 --> 00:19:25,650]  We'd like to have an industry that is growing and strong and vibrant.\n",
            "[00:19:25,650 --> 00:19:27,650]  So it's good for everybody.\n",
            "[00:19:27,650 --> 00:19:30,280]  Okay, thank you.\n",
            "[00:19:30,280 --> 00:19:41,280]  And my second question is about, could you give us some part about our 5G base station deployment plan?\n",
            "[00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:55,500]  Zhonghua says they will try to deploy almost 4,000 5G base stations maybe around the end of 2020.\n",
            "[00:19:55,500 --> 00:20:02,600]  So what's the target for TWN? Thank you.\n",
            "[00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:03,890]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:20:03,890 --> 00:20:08,890]  So I think right now the big three all have similar plans for the rest of the year.\n",
            "[00:20:09,890 --> 00:20:13,890]  And I think most of the numbers have been published.\n",
            "[00:20:13,890 --> 00:20:16,890]  So we have nothing more to add on.\n",
            "[00:20:16,890 --> 00:20:20,420]  Okay, thank you.\n",
            "[00:20:20,420 --> 00:20:21,420]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:20:21,420 --> 00:20:24,420]  Just one final question.\n",
            "[00:20:24,420 --> 00:20:33,450]  About the handset, the handset sales is very low in the first half of 2020.\n",
            "[00:20:34,450 --> 00:20:43,670]  So will the handset sales recover in the second half of 2020?\n",
            "[00:20:43,670 --> 00:20:56,670]  Or we need to hope the recovery will happen in 2021? Thank you.\n",
            "[00:20:56,670 --> 00:20:58,770]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:20:58,770 --> 00:21:15,060]  So like we said in our takeaway, we see it going through a process of accelerating as more and more appealing 5G phones being introduced to the market.\n",
            "[00:21:15,060 --> 00:21:17,060]  So it's not going to be overnighting.\n",
            "[00:21:17,060 --> 00:21:23,010]  But we do expect things to heat up over time.\n",
            "[00:21:23,010 --> 00:21:25,360]  Okay, thank you.\n",
            "[00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:27,990]  Thank you, Jack.\n",

            "[00:21:29,990 --> 00:21:32,990]  Another question comes from James of UBS.\n",
            "[00:21:32,990 --> 00:21:35,150]  Please go ahead, James.\n",
            "[00:21:35,150 --> 00:21:36,150]  Good afternoon, management.\n",
            "[00:21:36,150 --> 00:21:41,150]  So I just wanted to get a bit more detail about the DoublePlay strategy.\n",
            "[00:21:41,150 --> 00:21:47,150]  So can I just get an understanding of what proportion of your customers are currently on the DoublePlay\n",
            "[00:21:47,150 --> 00:21:51,150]  and what the margin is for the DoublePlay business?\n",
            "[00:21:51,150 --> 00:21:54,150]  Is it a higher margin compared to the existing business?\n",
            "[00:21:54,150 --> 00:22:00,150]  Also trying to get an understanding of what the churn rate is for DoublePlay customers versus a single product customer.\n",
            "[00:22:00,150 --> 00:22:05,150]  And then how does that translate into potential savings on sales and marketing?\n",
            "[00:22:05,150 --> 00:22:07,700]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:22:07,700 --> 00:22:08,700]  Thank you, James.\n",
            "[00:22:08,700 --> 00:22:15,700]  So right now, we're still in the early phase of introducing DoublePlay to the market.\n",
            "[00:22:16,700 --> 00:22:24,700]  So we prefer not to talk about the percentage of our customer base that's on the plan.\n",
            "[00:22:24,700 --> 00:22:41,530]  In terms of sort of the ARPU that it generates, like we said, it's providing healthy tailwind to the ARPU mix.\n",
            "[00:22:41,530 --> 00:22:45,530]  And then in terms of ‚Äì I'm sorry, what's your last ‚Äì\n",
            "[00:22:45,530 --> 00:22:49,530]  And then ‚Äì and sorry, is it accretive to margin?\n",
            "[00:22:49,530 --> 00:22:52,530]  Is that business accretive to margin or is it dilutive to margin?\n",
            "[00:22:52,530 --> 00:22:56,840]  Are you discounting more on average overall?\n",
            "[00:22:56,840 --> 00:23:00,840]  I would say it's accretive overall.\n",
            "[00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:10,600]  And then how do we ‚Äì do you have any data on churn rate for DoublePlay customers versus Coldplay customers?\n",
            "[00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:20,890]  So we have only been offering this product to our customer base for a little bit over ‚Äì actually, a little bit over a year.\n",
            "[00:23:20,890 --> 00:23:30,890]  And then most of the contracts are 24-months-plus contracts, so it's still too early to talk about the churn rate.\n",
            "[00:23:30,890 --> 00:23:33,050]  All right. Thank you.\n",

            "[00:26:38,100 --> 00:26:39,100]  Yes, sir.\n",
            "[00:26:39,100 --> 00:26:41,100]  Kurt, that's your first question.\n",
            "[00:26:41,100 --> 00:26:42,100]  Do you have a second question?\n",
            "[00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:43,450]  Second question.\n",
            "[00:26:43,450 --> 00:26:44,450]  Second question.\n",
            "[00:26:44,450 --> 00:26:46,450]  How do you see the competitive environment for 5G?\n",
            "[00:26:46,450 --> 00:26:53,450]  I mean, given the fact that Taiwan Star is sort of pushing a 699 limited plan, which\n",
            "[00:26:53,450 --> 00:26:56,450]  is about a 50% discount to Big 3 pricing, right?\n",
            "[00:26:56,450 --> 00:26:59,450]  So how do you see the competitive environment in the 5G era?\n",
            "[00:26:59,450 --> 00:27:00,450]  That's my last question.\n",
            "[00:27:00,450 --> 00:27:01,450]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:27:01,450 --> 00:27:03,060]  Thank you, Kurt.\n",
            "[00:27:03,060 --> 00:27:07,820]  Let Rosie talk a little bit about IFR 15.\n",
            "[00:27:07,820 --> 00:27:21,820]  On the IFR 15, as the handset sales declined, the adjusted increment in our overall revenue\n",
            "[00:27:21,820 --> 00:27:23,820]  will also go down.\n",
            "[00:27:23,820 --> 00:27:27,460]  So that's the impact.\n",
            "[00:27:27,460 --> 00:27:34,460]  Okay, just to be sure, so on cash basis, are you guys making profit from handset sale,\n",
            "[00:27:34,460 --> 00:27:39,480]  or are you making a net loss on cash basis?\n",
            "[00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:49,790]  On cash basis, during the contract period, I think we are still making a profit.\n",
            "[00:27:49,790 --> 00:27:54,790]  I mean, if you include monthly tax, of course you have to be making profit, right?\n",
            "[00:27:54,790 --> 00:27:59,790]  But if you only look at your handset sale, are you making profit?\n",
            "[00:27:59,790 --> 00:28:05,400]  When you sell one handset, are you making profit, or are you making loss?\n",
            "[00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:11,070]  Are you talking about bundled sales, or just handset sales?\n",
            "[00:28:11,070 --> 00:28:12,070]  Bundled plans.\n",
            "[00:28:12,070 --> 00:28:17,420]  Bundled plans, no, not at the beginning.\n",
            "[00:28:17,420 --> 00:28:24,990]  During the contract period, we are making a profit out of the service.\n",
            "[00:28:24,990 --> 00:28:35,410]  Okay, so under IFR 15, when you sell a handset under a bundled plan, you initially do a loss\n",
            "[00:28:35,410 --> 00:28:39,410]  in P&L, and then later you make profit from monthly tax.\n",
            "[00:28:39,410 --> 00:28:41,410]  That's how accounting works.\n",
            "[00:28:44,740 --> 00:28:46,900]  Kurt, you amortized.\n",
            "[00:28:46,900 --> 00:28:54,900]  So, essentially, we subsidize handsets in a bundled sale situation, and the subsidy\n",
            "[00:28:54,900 --> 00:29:00,900]  under IFRS would be amortized over the length of the contract.\n",
            "[00:29:00,900 --> 00:29:02,580]  Yeah.\n",
            "[00:29:05,700 --> 00:29:08,140]  Yes, go ahead.\n",
            "[00:29:08,140 --> 00:29:10,620]  Yes, thank you.\n",
            "[00:29:10,620 --> 00:29:14,620]  So, I guess I sort of understand the basics of IFRS 15, right?\n",
            "[00:29:14,620 --> 00:29:21,620]  So, my question is, I mean, your competitors should be conducting the same accounting standards,\n",
            "[00:29:21,620 --> 00:29:22,620]  right?\n",
            "[00:29:22,620 --> 00:29:23,620]  Yeah.\n",
            "[00:29:23,620 --> 00:29:26,620]  And then you are the only one who actually booked a profit, accounting profit decline\n",
            "[00:29:26,620 --> 00:29:28,620]  in the second quarter.\n",
            "[00:29:28,620 --> 00:29:34,620]  So, it looks like it's because of the IFRS 15 bundled adjustment, right?\n",
            "[00:29:34,620 --> 00:29:39,620]  Because that's clearly stated at the very top of your financial statement.\n",
            "[00:29:39,620 --> 00:29:42,620]  So, I'd like to better understand what is really going on.\n",
            "[00:29:44,290 --> 00:29:51,290]  Well, I think Firestone also experienced a decline in their revenues in the second quarter.\n",
            "[00:29:54,760 --> 00:30:03,790]  And we are also the one that's suffering from fewer handsets sold during the period.\n",
            "[00:30:05,660 --> 00:30:06,660]  Okay.\n",
            "[00:30:06,660 --> 00:30:10,660]  So, overall, when you sell handsets on a standalone basis, you are making profit, right?\n",
            "[00:30:10,660 --> 00:30:14,660]  Then, because of COVID-19, handset sales overall declined a lot.\n",
            "[00:30:14,660 --> 00:30:17,660]  Therefore, that had a negative impact on your earnings.\n",
            "[00:30:17,660 --> 00:30:19,660]  Is that correct understanding?\n",
            "[00:30:20,750 --> 00:30:22,910]  Partially so.\n",
            "[00:30:22,910 --> 00:30:31,300]  Partially no, because we are entering the 5G era.\n",
            "[00:30:31,300 --> 00:30:42,300]  So, most of the subscribers are probably sidelined to wait for the launch of 5G.\n",
            "[00:30:43,300 --> 00:30:52,300]  And also waiting for 5G handsets to be put on the market.\n",
            "[00:30:52,300 --> 00:30:59,300]  So, the overall handsets sold in the first half declined a lot.\n",
            "[00:31:00,460 --> 00:31:05,460]  And did that have a negative impact on your P&L or positive impact on your P&L?\n",
            "[00:31:05,460 --> 00:31:08,770]  Negatively.\n",
            "[00:31:08,770 --> 00:31:12,760]  Negatively, right? Okay, that's fine. Thank you.\n",
            "[00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:16,760]  And then, maybe let's move on to the second question.\n",
            "[00:31:16,760 --> 00:31:18,760]  5G competitive environment.\n",
            "[00:31:20,820 --> 00:31:21,820]  Yes.\n",
            "[00:31:21,820 --> 00:31:25,820]  So, in terms of 5G competitive environment, we see the big three.\n",
            "[00:31:25,820 --> 00:31:41,040]  Being able to offer high quality, wide coverage, good reception 5G networks.\n",
            "[00:31:42,040 --> 00:31:49,040]  In terms of smaller players, if they don't engage into network sharing with the bigger players,\n",
            "[00:31:50,040 --> 00:31:57,390]  we do not expect them in the short run, without a lot of fundraising,\n",
            "[00:31:57,390 --> 00:32:01,390]  being able to offer the network at the same quality.\n",
            "[00:32:01,390 --> 00:32:06,390]  So, because of the quality difference, they would have to price the service differently.\n",
            "[00:32:06,390 --> 00:32:16,390]  And they would have to convince the market that a partial 5G service is what they want.\n",
            "[00:32:16,390 --> 00:32:22,390]  So, maybe there will be a percentage of the market that would want a service from that type of network.\n",
            "[00:32:23,390 --> 00:32:37,940]  But we see the vast majority of users would prefer the high quality 5G network that the big three are offering.\n",
            "[00:32:37,940 --> 00:32:51,030]  And the big three, like we said, have come to a very restrained consensus on pricing.\n",
            "[00:32:51,030 --> 00:32:55,190]  So, that's what the competitive landscape is right now.\n",
            "[00:32:56,190 --> 00:33:03,190]  Of course, nobody knows how it's going to turn out to be a few months from now.\n",
            "[00:33:03,190 --> 00:33:07,190]  So, we'll continue to navigate methodically and carefully.\n",
            "[00:33:09,060 --> 00:33:10,060]  Thank you. Very helpful.\n",
            "[00:33:11,150 --> 00:33:14,940]  Thank you, Kurt.\n",
            "[00:33:14,940 --> 00:33:15,940]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:33:15,940 --> 00:33:20,160]  Ladies and gentlemen, if you have other questions, please press star 1.\n",
            "[00:33:20,160 --> 00:33:21,160]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:33:21,160 --> 00:33:30,980]  Once again, it's star 1 to ask a question.\n",
            "[00:33:30,980 --> 00:33:31,980]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:33:31,980 --> 00:33:44,800]  Now, Jack has another follow-up question.\n",
            "[00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:45,800]  Please go ahead, Jack.\n",
            "[00:33:45,800 --> 00:33:47,150]  Okay, thank you.\n",
            "[00:33:47,150 --> 00:33:53,150]  Also, thanks for giving me the chance to ask questions.\n",
            "[00:33:53,150 --> 00:33:55,150]  My question is about cable TV.\n",
            "[00:33:55,150 --> 00:34:02,150]  We see the QOQ and the YOY cable TV business also grow steadily.\n",
            "[00:34:02,150 --> 00:34:10,150]  So, could you give us some kind of other cable TV business in the second half of the year?\n",
            "[00:34:11,150 --> 00:34:15,580]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:34:15,580 --> 00:34:22,580]  So, Jack, are you referring to our EBIT growing for our cable TV business?\n",
            "[00:34:22,580 --> 00:34:23,670]  Oh, yes.\n",
            "[00:34:23,670 --> 00:34:24,670]  Cable TV.\n",
            "[00:34:24,670 --> 00:34:26,670]  Sorry, my sound may be not clear.\n",
            "[00:34:26,670 --> 00:34:29,790]  Yes, it's correct.\n",
            "[00:34:29,790 --> 00:34:30,790]  Cable TV.\n",
            "[00:34:30,790 --> 00:34:33,790]  Cable TV is a viewpoint in the second half of 2020.\n",
            "[00:34:33,790 --> 00:34:34,790]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:34:45,550 --> 00:34:58,420]  Jack, we traditionally don't give out guidance to specific subsidiaries or business units.\n",
            "[00:34:58,420 --> 00:35:12,570]  So, I don't think there's much we can say about the outlook of the cable business in the second half of 2020.\n",
            "[00:35:12,570 --> 00:35:13,570]  Okay.\n",
            "[00:35:13,570 --> 00:35:22,620]  So, will the cable TV business grow in the second half of 2020?\n",
            "[00:35:22,620 --> 00:35:23,620]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:35:23,620 --> 00:35:26,680]  Well, there are a few factors, right?\n",
            "[00:35:26,680 --> 00:35:32,680]  So, it depends on if there are new entrants into the marketplace.\n",
            "[00:35:32,680 --> 00:35:37,840]  So, there's always a risk of that.\n",
            "[00:35:37,840 --> 00:35:51,840]  And then the second factor would be our ability to sign up more customers, especially in terms of broadband and DTV penetration.\n",
            "[00:35:51,840 --> 00:35:56,840]  And our DoublePlay product is actually providing tailwind to that.\n",
            "[00:35:56,840 --> 00:36:08,840]  So, it's hard to gauge between these two forces what the end result will be for the second half of 2020.\n",
            "[00:36:08,840 --> 00:36:20,840]  So, I'm sorry, but you'll have to wait for our next conference call to hear how things turn out in the next quarter, in this quarter.\n",
            "[00:36:20,840 --> 00:36:22,190]  I see.\n",
            "[00:36:22,190 --> 00:36:25,190]  So, about the DoublePlay strategy.\n",
            "[00:36:25,190 --> 00:36:31,190]  So, they will combine the mobile phone and the cable TV.\n",
            "[00:36:31,190 --> 00:36:47,190]  So, does that mean the DoublePlay strategy has a very good development in the future?\n",
            "[00:36:47,190 --> 00:36:54,310]  And does that also mean the cable TV revenue will also grow in the future?\n",
            "[00:36:55,310 --> 00:37:09,660]  So, we see the DoublePlay as a win-win situation for both our mobile business and our cable business.\n",
            "[00:37:09,660 --> 00:37:18,660]  So, our mobile business, in terms of 5G, we all know that the indoor coverage for 5G is more challenging.\n",
            "[00:37:18,660 --> 00:37:31,660]  So, the ability to bundle home broadband helps the mobile business provide seamless coverage at home for our customers.\n",
            "[00:37:31,660 --> 00:37:37,660]  On the other hand, yes, our cable TV business also looks to grow its broadband penetration.\n",
            "[00:37:37,660 --> 00:37:45,820]  So, with DoublePlay, it also helps our cable TV business grow its broadband penetration.\n",
            "[00:37:45,820 --> 00:37:53,820]  So, we see DoublePlay as sort of this product that provides win-win for both of our businesses.\n",
            "[00:37:53,820 --> 00:37:54,820]  Okay, thank you.\n",
            "[00:37:54,820 --> 00:37:57,520]  Thank you, Jeff.\n",
            "[00:37:57,520 --> 00:37:58,520]  Thank you, Jack.\n",
            "[00:37:58,520 --> 00:38:00,130]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:38:00,130 --> 00:38:07,110]  Ladies and gentlemen, if you have other questions, please press star 1.\n",
            "[00:38:07,110 --> 00:38:08,110]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:38:08,110 --> 00:38:17,740]  Jamie and Rosie, there seems to be no other questions online.\n",
            "[00:38:17,740 --> 00:38:19,740]  Do you have other comments?\n",
            "[00:38:19,740 --> 00:38:20,740]  No.\n",
            "[00:38:20,740 --> 00:38:22,340]  Thank you, everyone.\n",
            "[00:38:22,340 --> 00:38:24,340]  Thanks for joining us this afternoon.\n",
            "[00:38:24,340 --> 00:38:27,340]  We look forward to speaking to you again next quarter.\n",
            "[00:38:27,340 --> 00:38:28,340]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:38:28,340 --> 00:38:29,340]  Have a good evening.\n",
            "[00:38:29,340 --> 00:38:30,340]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:38:30,340 --> 00:38:31,340]  Thank you.\n",

            "[00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:35,760]  This concludes the conference then.\n",
            "[00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:36,760]  Goodbye.\n"

            "[00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:06,000]  Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to the conference call. Today with us, we have Jamie. Please go ahead. Thank you.\n",
            "[00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:15,340]  Good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to Taiwan Mobile's first quarter 2020 investor conference call.\n",
            "[00:00:15,340 --> 00:00:22,430]  Before I start our presentation, I would like to direct your attention to our disclaimer page, which states,\n",

            "[00:01:02,780 --> 00:01:10,900]  Now let's look at the business overview. I would like to start with the operational highlights of Q1 2020.\n",
            "[00:01:10,900 --> 00:01:18,220]  First, I would like to point out three key highlights in our Q1 results.\n",
            "[00:01:19,220 --> 00:01:31,220]  Point number one, while the telecom operating environment continues to be challenging, Taiwan Mobile managed to deliver outstanding results in Q1, posting EBIT growth across all of our businesses.\n",
            "[00:01:31,220 --> 00:01:41,310]  Point number two, ahead of 5G commercial launch in 3Q, we are accelerating our infrastructure rollout and early-birth sign-ups.\n",
            "[00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:50,310]  And point number three, the boom of stay-at-home economy triggered by COVID-19 has boded well for our e-commerce business, Momo,\n",
            "[00:01:50,310 --> 00:02:01,580]  while increased demand for high-speed home broadband access has provided solid tailwind to our wireline business.\n",
            "[00:02:01,580 --> 00:02:07,580]  As a result of our excelling efforts through our double-play bundles and 5G early-birth plans,\n",
            "[00:02:07,580 --> 00:02:17,580]  the average monthly tariff of our new sign-ups for both bundle and SIM-only plans increased significantly in Q1.\n",
            "[00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:26,670]  On the enterprise side, demand for IoT connectivity continued to be solid with 36% worldwide increase in the quarter.\n",
            "[00:02:26,670 --> 00:02:35,670]  The enterprise wireline business, which represents close to 10% of our telecom service revenue, posted a healthy 4% worldwide growth,\n",
            "[00:02:35,670 --> 00:02:42,280]  of which cloud, ICT, and IoT revenues grew by 36% worldwide.\n",
            "[00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:47,950]  Next up, let's turn to our resilience in pay TV business page.\n",
            "[00:02:47,950 --> 00:02:53,950]  So turning to our pay TV business, once again, we fared better than our other leading MSOs,\n",
            "[00:02:54,950 --> 00:03:02,950]  posting a smaller loss in basic TV subscriptions and much higher broadband and DTV penetration,\n",
            "[00:03:02,950 --> 00:03:06,950]  added by our cross-selling efforts, especially through the double-play products.\n",
            "[00:03:06,950 --> 00:03:17,750]  The percentage of customers subscribing to speeds of 100Mbps and higher improved by 6 percentage points from a year ago.\n",
            "[00:03:17,750 --> 00:03:30,930]  On the financial side, with a 38% worldwide decline in depreciation and amortization, EBIT saw a 10% worldwide growth in the first quarter.\n",
            "[00:03:30,930 --> 00:03:34,930]  And last but not least, let's take a look at Momo, our star business.\n",
            "[00:03:34,930 --> 00:03:39,930]  In Q1, benefiting from stronger demand from stay-at-home economy,\n",
            "[00:03:39,930 --> 00:03:46,930]  Momo's B2C revenue grew by 35% worldwide as people stocked up on essential items.\n",
            "[00:03:46,930 --> 00:03:54,150]  Not only did the number of transactions per customer increase 14% worldwide,\n",
            "[00:03:54,150 --> 00:04:04,150]  Momo also added one satellite warehouse in Q1, taking its total number of satellite warehouses to 15, that is 10 more than a year ago.\n",
            "[00:04:04,150 --> 00:04:13,180]  It continued to take more pocket share from the brick-and-mortar retailers while widening its lead over its peers.\n",
            "[00:04:13,180 --> 00:04:20,860]  Despite rising logistics costs, Momo's e-commerce business EBIT grew by 45% worldwide,\n",
            "[00:04:20,860 --> 00:04:25,860]  which is higher than its revenue growth, thanks to margin expansions.\n",
            "[00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:35,950]  That helped Momo set a significant milestone in our group, scoring No. 2 in bottom-line contribution, outpacing PayTV two quarters in a row.\n",
            "[00:04:35,950 --> 00:04:45,670]  And finally, I would like to end my section of the presentation with this superior overall performance slide,\n",
            "[00:04:45,670 --> 00:04:50,670]  which shows in Q1 Taiwan Mobile delivered the best results among our peers,\n",
            "[00:04:50,670 --> 00:04:54,670]  posting worldwide growth in its revenue, EBIT, and net income.\n",
            "[00:04:54,670 --> 00:04:59,670]  Our guidance achievement ratio was also the best among the three major players.\n",
            "[00:04:59,670 --> 00:05:04,670]  Now with that, let me turn over the presentation to Rosie for our financial overview.\n",
            "[00:05:04,670 --> 00:05:12,790]  Hi, good afternoon. Let's look at the performance by business on page 10.\n",
            "[00:05:12,790 --> 00:05:21,020]  In the first quarter, these businesses have proven to be resilient even in times of COVID-19 crisis.\n",
            "[00:05:21,020 --> 00:05:28,180]  In the first quarter of 2020, our consolidated revenue grew by 7% year-on-year,\n",
            "[00:05:28,180 --> 00:05:32,210]  mainly driven by Momo's robust e-commerce revenue growth.\n",
            "[00:05:32,210 --> 00:05:42,940]  While telecom and cable TV EBITDA declined year-on-year, at the EBIT level, both showed year-on-year growth.\n",
            "[00:05:42,940 --> 00:05:51,230]  As CNA continued to taper off, therefore, all three major businesses saw year-on-year growth in EBIT.\n",
            "[00:05:51,230 --> 00:05:57,230]  And the rate of growth accelerated to 6% versus previous quarter.\n",
            "[00:05:57,230 --> 00:06:00,840]  Let's move to results summary page.\n",
            "[00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:11,300]  Overall, our operating income for all major businesses exceeded guidance in the first quarter.\n",
            "[00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:19,460]  Non-operating expenses came in lower than expected on account of lower interest expenses.\n",
            "[00:06:19,460 --> 00:06:26,000]  As a result, net income exceeded our first quarter guidance by 12%.\n",
            "[00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,990]  Now let's look at the balance sheet.\n",
            "[00:06:29,990 --> 00:06:39,240]  On the asset side, concessions surged after making the payment for the 5G spectrum in February.\n",
            "[00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:46,530]  On the liability front, to lock in long-term capital in a low-interest rate environment,\n",
            "[00:06:46,530 --> 00:06:51,530]  we completed the $20 billion anti-dollar corporate bond issuance during the quarter,\n",
            "[00:06:51,530 --> 00:07:04,190]  with maturities ranging from 5 to 10 years, as interest rates ranging from 0.64% to 0.72%.\n",
            "[00:07:04,190 --> 00:07:13,800]  Accordingly, growth debt saw a year-on-year increase to $67 billion in the first quarter.\n",
            "[00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:22,800]  Despite taking on more debt after the 5G spectrum auction, net debt to EBITDA only rose to 1.8 times,\n",
            "[00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:26,410]  while interest coverage further improved.\n",
            "[00:07:26,410 --> 00:07:32,410]  As for shareholders' equity, the increase in paid-in capital and capital surplus\n",
            "[00:07:32,410 --> 00:07:36,410]  is reflective of the conversion of our convertible bonds,\n",
            "[00:07:36,410 --> 00:07:44,890]  which had an outstanding balance of only $0.93 billion at the end of the first quarter.\n",
            "[00:07:44,890 --> 00:07:49,520]  Now let's look at the cash flow.\n",
            "[00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:55,090]  In the first quarter, the year-on-year increase in operating cash flow\n",
            "[00:07:55,090 --> 00:08:00,090]  was due mainly to the undersupply of iPhone 11 amidst the pandemic,\n",
            "[00:08:00,090 --> 00:08:04,180]  which resulted in the decrease in mobile handset inventory.\n",
            "[00:08:04,180 --> 00:08:11,220]  The quarter-on-quarter increase stemmed from higher outflows in the fourth quarter last year\n",
            "[00:08:11,220 --> 00:08:16,220]  as mobile third-quarter payables were delayed into fourth quarter.\n",
            "[00:08:16,220 --> 00:08:25,890]  Investing cash outflows surged as we spent $30.6 billion to acquire the 5G spectrum.\n",
            "[00:08:26,890 --> 00:08:32,300]  On the financing front, to pay for the 5G licensing fees,\n",
            "[00:08:32,300 --> 00:08:40,720]  $24.09 billion was raised through short-term bank borrowings and corporate bond issuance.\n",
            "[00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:48,100]  With capex falling year-on-year as we approached the tail end of 4G investment cycle,\n",
            "[00:08:48,100 --> 00:08:54,100]  pre-cash flow calculated with pre-IFR16 operating cash flow,\n",
            "[00:08:54,100 --> 00:09:03,100]  excluding 5G licensing fees, reached $6.6 billion, up 20% year-on-year.\n",
            "[00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:08,450]  Let me turn the presentation over to Jamie for event updates and key messages.\n",
            "[00:09:08,450 --> 00:09:11,180]  Thanks, Rosie.\n",
            "[00:09:11,180 --> 00:09:14,180]  So let's take a look at event updates.\n",
            "[00:09:14,180 --> 00:09:18,180]  With lower visibility into the broader economic outlook,\n",
            "[00:09:18,180 --> 00:09:29,180]  the board has proposed to pay DPS of $4.75 NT, i.e., 70% of our 2019 pre-cash flow.\n",
            "[00:09:29,180 --> 00:09:36,410]  That translates into around 4.4% dividend yield based on today's closing price,\n",
            "[00:09:36,410 --> 00:09:41,360]  same level as a year ago.\n",
            "[00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:46,520]  Next, I'd like to turn to the awards and recognition page.\n",
            "[00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:54,700]  This page summarizes the awards and recognitions we received during the quarter for your reference.\n",
            "[00:09:54,700 --> 00:09:58,700]  And finally, let's take a look at the key message page.\n",
            "[00:09:58,700 --> 00:10:04,860]  To wrap our presentation, here is the key message that we would like for you to take away with.\n",
            "[00:10:04,860 --> 00:10:10,860]  B2C commerce as well as subscription-based wireless broadband and enterprise solutions\n",
            "[00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:15,860]  are increasingly essential to everyday life under this new normal.\n",
            "[00:10:15,860 --> 00:10:24,620]  As such, we are better poised for the extended stress on the economy caused by COVID-19.\n",
            "[00:10:24,620 --> 00:10:31,620]  Secondly, investing in critical areas like 5G, broadband, and e-commerce remains our top priority\n",
            "[00:10:31,620 --> 00:10:37,620]  as we accelerate growth and our transformation into a tech plus telco group.\n",
            "[00:10:37,620 --> 00:10:42,620]  At the same time, we will strive to resume FCA stability in a sound manner\n",
            "[00:10:42,620 --> 00:10:47,300]  so that we can uphold our commitment to shareholders.\n",
            "[00:10:47,300 --> 00:10:51,300]  With that, I would like to open the floor up for Q&A session. Thank you.\n",
            "[00:10:51,300 --> 00:10:53,100]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:58,700]  Ladies and gentlemen, should you like to raise a question, please star one on your telephone keypad.\n",
            "[00:10:58,700 --> 00:11:18,810]  Our first question comes from James from UBS. Please go ahead with your question.\n",
            "[00:11:18,810 --> 00:11:21,220]  Hey guys, good afternoon.\n",
            "[00:11:21,220 --> 00:11:26,220]  So, my first question is around how you're looking to position the 5G product.\n",
            "[00:11:26,220 --> 00:11:32,220]  In Taiwan, most customers are accustomed to unlimited data plans in 4G.\n",
            "[00:11:32,220 --> 00:11:38,220]  In 5G, how do you entice customers to pay a bit more for this new product?\n",
            "[00:11:38,220 --> 00:11:41,220]  And the second question is just around the government subsidy fund,\n",
            "[00:11:41,220 --> 00:11:45,220]  and that looks like it's going to be about $60 billion.\n",
            "[00:11:45,220 --> 00:11:47,220]  When do you think that's going to be in place,\n",
            "[00:11:47,220 --> 00:11:51,220]  and how do you think that's going to help small operators like ourselves?\n",
            "[00:11:51,220 --> 00:11:56,480]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:57,480]  Thank you, James.\n",
            "[00:11:57,480 --> 00:12:02,480]  So, in terms of positioning the 5G product,\n",
            "[00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:09,480]  right now it looks like there are sort of a consensus in the marketplace.\n",
            "[00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:23,510]  So, the big three players are all offering early bird packages at around $1,400 tariff.\n",
            "[00:12:23,510 --> 00:12:30,510]  And right now we're seeing pretty healthy early bird sign-ups from our customer base.\n",
            "[00:12:30,510 --> 00:12:37,510]  So, I think right now that's the direction the market is going.\n",
            "[00:12:37,510 --> 00:12:47,990]  Hopefully, with 5G, our whole erosion will happen a bit slower than 4G.\n",
            "[00:12:47,990 --> 00:12:51,020]  Yeah, so that's that for your question number one.\n",
            "[00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:53,020]  For your question number two,\n",
            "[00:12:54,020 --> 00:13:02,020]  there has been some sort of frameworks in terms of some of these subsidy funds,\n",
            "[00:13:02,020 --> 00:13:10,020]  but so far we haven't received any sort of confirmed details.\n",
            "[00:13:10,020 --> 00:13:20,400]  So, we'll need to wait until things are more clear to be able to share that with you guys.\n",
            "[00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:23,420]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:13:23,420 --> 00:13:24,450]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:13:24,450 --> 00:13:27,500]  Our next question comes from HSBC.\n",
            "[00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:31,160]  Please go ahead.\n",
            "[00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:32,160]  Thanks very much.\n",
            "[00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:33,160]  Good afternoon.\n",
            "[00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:34,160]  Two questions, please.\n",
            "[00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:37,160]  The first is on the mobile service revenue.\n",
            "[00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:44,320]  It's down 9% year-on-year or 7% depending on the accounting standard.\n",
            "[00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:53,020]  I wondered if you had any better visibility for when that might start to stabilize.\n",
            "[00:13:53,020 --> 00:13:57,020]  And the second question is on the DNA.\n",
            "[00:13:57,020 --> 00:14:03,020]  Obviously, you've been able to offset this impact for both ATV and mobile\n",
            "[00:14:03,020 --> 00:14:07,500]  with lower depreciation and monetization in the first quarter.\n",
            "[00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:12,500]  Do you expect that to continue, that lower DNA, into the third quarter\n",
            "[00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:15,500]  and then we start to get some of the 5G costs coming through?\n",
            "[00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:17,660]  Is that how you're thinking about it?\n",
            "[00:14:17,660 --> 00:14:21,900]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:14:21,900 --> 00:14:22,900]  All right.\n",
            "[00:14:22,900 --> 00:14:27,900]  So, in terms of mobile service revenue decline,\n",
            "[00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:37,900]  so in the recent quarters we have been observing a stronger preference towards\n",
            "[00:14:37,900 --> 00:14:45,900]  SIM-only plans from our customers that are renewing their contracts with us.\n",
            "[00:14:45,900 --> 00:14:54,900]  We suspect that's due to this period leading to 5G.\n",
            "[00:14:54,900 --> 00:15:02,900]  More customers are waiting to buy 5G phones instead of investing in 4G phones.\n",
            "[00:15:02,900 --> 00:15:18,090]  So, in this period we do not want to essentially force them to\n",
            "[00:15:18,090 --> 00:15:24,250]  or use heavy subsidies to entice them to buy 4G phones.\n",
            "[00:15:24,250 --> 00:15:31,250]  And only in a few quarters for them to come back and complain to us that\n",
            "[00:15:31,250 --> 00:15:33,250]  they really wanted a 5G phone.\n",
            "[00:15:33,250 --> 00:15:40,250]  So, that is why we're observing a larger than peers mobile service revenue decline.\n",
            "[00:15:40,250 --> 00:15:45,250]  But if you look at our bottom line, we are actually doing much better than our peers.\n",
            "[00:15:45,250 --> 00:15:51,250]  And, yes, we're expecting it to stabilize within the next two quarters,\n",
            "[00:15:51,250 --> 00:15:53,250]  especially when 5G roads are on.\n",
            "[00:15:53,250 --> 00:16:01,250]  The customers that are waiting to upgrade to 5G phones will be then increasing\n",
            "[00:16:01,250 --> 00:16:06,250]  the up for phone bundle plan.\n",
            "[00:16:06,250 --> 00:16:11,250]  In terms of DNA, I'll let Rosie speak a little bit on it.\n",
            "[00:16:11,250 --> 00:16:20,110]  Well, DNA, actually, after the 5G launch, the DNA will go up inevitably.\n",
            "[00:16:20,110 --> 00:16:28,540]  So, that will be a fact in the second half.\n",
            "[00:16:28,540 --> 00:16:29,540]  Thank you, Neon.\n",
            "[00:16:29,540 --> 00:16:32,880]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:35,880]  Once again, ladies and gentlemen, Star 1 Geeks for questions.\n",
            "[00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:38,880]  And our next question comes from Jack Xu from Sinopec.\n",
            "[00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:39,880]  Please go ahead. Thank you.\n",
            "[00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:47,240]  Good afternoon, and thanks for giving me the chance to ask questions.\n",
            "[00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:49,240]  I have two questions.\n",
            "[00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:54,240]  My first question is about do we have any goal for our 5G subscribers\n",
            "[00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:59,240]  in the end of 2020 and 2021?\n",
            "[00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:03,720]  This is the first question.\n",
            "[00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:14,010]  And my second question is about right now we see fewer 5G phones in the market.\n",
            "[00:17:15,010 --> 00:17:23,010]  I'm also confused about if there is not enough 5G phone,\n",
            "[00:17:23,010 --> 00:17:29,870]  the 5G environment cannot be built easily.\n",
            "[00:17:29,870 --> 00:17:41,870]  So, do we see any sign or will there more 5G phone will be\n",
            "[00:17:42,870 --> 00:17:48,870]  publicly in the second half of 2020?\n",
            "[00:17:48,870 --> 00:17:51,180]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:17:51,180 --> 00:17:52,180]  Thank you, Jack.\n",
            "[00:17:52,180 --> 00:17:56,180]  I think the goal for 5G subscribers,\n",
            "[00:17:56,180 --> 00:18:05,280]  all we can say is we're aiming to increase our market share in the 5G market.\n",
            "[00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:12,280]  But it really depends on the speed that the market adapts to this new technology.\n",
            "[00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:19,280]  So, right now it's hard for us to comment exactly on the absolute number of 5G subscribers\n",
            "[00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:23,280]  we're targeting to acquire going forward.\n",
            "[00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:28,280]  The second question in terms of 5G phones,\n",
            "[00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:33,280]  based on the information we're getting from the OEMs,\n",
            "[00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:40,280]  it looks like there will be around 20 SKUs by the end of the year.\n",
            "[00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:49,280]  So, we suspect that's enough of variety for the end consumers\n",
            "[00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:52,280]  that want to upgrade to 5G great plans to choose from.\n",
            "[00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:55,280]  And based on our understanding,\n",
            "[00:18:55,280 --> 00:19:01,280]  there will be both high-end phones and mid- and low-end phones.\n",
            "[00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:09,230]  So, it will have enough options to serve different segments of the market.\n",
            "[00:19:09,230 --> 00:19:11,230]  I hope that answers your question, Jack.\n",
            "[00:19:11,230 --> 00:19:13,710]  Yes, thank you.\n",
            "[00:19:13,710 --> 00:19:15,710]  Just one final question.\n",
            "[00:19:15,710 --> 00:19:19,710]  So, what's the average price of the phone?\n",
            "[00:19:19,710 --> 00:19:31,320]  Will it be the average price below $500?\n",
            "[00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:34,820]  Based on our understanding,\n",
            "[00:19:34,820 --> 00:19:43,370]  there will be products in the $500 or less range.\n",
            "[00:19:43,370 --> 00:19:48,370]  There will also be products in the $500 to $1,000 range.\n",
            "[00:19:48,370 --> 00:19:52,370]  And also, of course, the above $1,000 range.\n",
            "[00:19:52,370 --> 00:19:58,450]  So, really, there will be options for everybody.\n",
            "[00:19:58,450 --> 00:20:00,450]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:20:00,450 --> 00:20:09,380]  And our next question comes from Billy Lee from Credit Suisse.\n",
            "[00:20:09,380 --> 00:20:12,380]  Hi. Thanks, Jamie and Rosie.\n",
            "[00:20:12,380 --> 00:20:14,380]  I've got three questions.\n",
            "[00:20:14,380 --> 00:20:18,380]  The first one is, can you talk about your dividend policy?\n",
            "[00:20:18,380 --> 00:20:23,380]  I know the dividend is down for the first time in quite a while.\n",
            "[00:20:23,380 --> 00:20:27,380]  So, I wonder what's going to be the dividend policy going forward.\n",
            "[00:20:27,380 --> 00:20:29,380]  Is it based on free cash flow\n",
            "[00:20:29,380 --> 00:20:32,380]  or is it going to be based on the earnings per share?\n",
            "[00:20:32,380 --> 00:20:36,380]  And the second question is about the 5G launch.\n",
            "[00:20:36,380 --> 00:20:41,380]  So far, has the launch been affected by the COVID-19 outbreak?\n",
            "[00:20:41,380 --> 00:20:45,380]  And how many 5G-based stations are you going to build this year?\n",
            "[00:20:45,380 --> 00:20:47,380]  And the third question is,\n",
            "[00:20:47,380 --> 00:20:52,380]  could you provide us an update on your cooperation strategy\n",
            "[00:20:52,380 --> 00:20:55,380]  with potentially partners like PowerStar and APP?\n",
            "[00:20:55,380 --> 00:20:56,380]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:20:56,380 --> 00:21:02,850]  Okay, let me answer your dividend policy question first.\n",
            "[00:21:02,850 --> 00:21:12,880]  Well, actually, this year is a very difficult year\n",
            "[00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:16,880]  for the board to make a decision on the dividend.\n",
            "[00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:20,980]  Well, I think, as you all understand,\n",
            "[00:21:20,980 --> 00:21:26,980]  the COVID-19 brings a lot of uncertainty.\n",
            "[00:21:26,980 --> 00:21:30,330]  So, just as Jamie mentioned,\n",
            "[00:21:30,330 --> 00:21:34,330]  with lower visibility into the broader economic outlook,\n",
            "[00:21:34,330 --> 00:21:40,330]  the board has proposed to pay DPS of 4.75.\n",
            "[00:21:40,330 --> 00:21:44,330]  Looking forward, I have no answer for you\n",
            "[00:21:44,330 --> 00:21:49,330]  because we are very committed to a stable dividend policy.\n",
            "[00:21:49,330 --> 00:21:52,330]  But given the current situation,\n",
            "[00:21:52,330 --> 00:21:56,330]  we think it could be in the best interest of the shareholders\n",
            "[00:21:56,330 --> 00:21:59,330]  to pay 4.75 this year.\n",
            "[00:21:59,330 --> 00:22:03,330]  But for the future,\n",
            "[00:22:03,330 --> 00:22:08,330]  it's always decided by the board every April.\n",
            "[00:22:08,330 --> 00:22:11,550]  So, I don't have a clear answer to you\n",
            "[00:22:11,550 --> 00:22:14,550]  because if you look back,\n",
            "[00:22:14,550 --> 00:22:25,940]  well, the DPS may not only hinge on DPS\n",
            "[00:22:26,940 --> 00:22:30,030]  or pre-cash flow.\n",
            "[00:22:30,030 --> 00:22:31,030]  It depends.\n",
            "[00:22:31,030 --> 00:22:35,030]  Okay, so it's always decided by the board every April.\n",
            "[00:22:35,030 --> 00:22:38,110]  All right, thanks, Rosie.\n",
            "[00:22:38,110 --> 00:22:42,110]  And in terms of 5G base station,\n",
            "[00:22:42,110 --> 00:22:48,110]  right now we're looking to build as aggressively,\n",
            "[00:22:48,110 --> 00:22:54,110]  if not more aggressively than all of our peers\n",
            "[00:22:55,110 --> 00:22:58,110]  leading into the early deployment of 5G.\n",
            "[00:22:58,110 --> 00:23:01,110]  In terms of the exact number of base stations,\n",
            "[00:23:01,110 --> 00:23:06,110]  it's sort of a strategic decision.\n",
            "[00:23:06,110 --> 00:23:10,110]  So, please forgive me for not being able to share\n",
            "[00:23:10,110 --> 00:23:12,210]  the exact number of base stations.\n",
            "[00:23:12,210 --> 00:23:16,210]  In terms of collaboration with smaller players,\n",
            "[00:23:16,210 --> 00:23:22,210]  all I can comment on is the industry is always talking.\n",
            "[00:23:22,210 --> 00:23:23,210]  We're always talking to each other\n",
            "[00:23:23,210 --> 00:23:26,210]  in terms of what kind of collaboration we can have.\n",
            "[00:23:26,210 --> 00:23:28,210]  Right now, nothing is set to stone yet.\n",
            "[00:23:28,210 --> 00:23:35,210]  So, please allow me to provide no comment for now.\n",
            "[00:23:35,210 --> 00:23:38,210]  And whenever we have a more solid progress,\n",
            "[00:23:38,210 --> 00:23:43,010]  please be assured that I will share them with you.\n",
            "[00:23:43,010 --> 00:23:45,010]  Sure, thank you.\n",
            "[00:23:45,010 --> 00:23:49,010]  Just another quick one I already raised\n",
            "[00:23:49,010 --> 00:23:54,010]  about the impact of COVID-19 on the 5G launch schedule.\n",
            "[00:23:54,010 --> 00:23:57,940]  Are you seeing any impact so far?\n",
            "[00:23:57,940 --> 00:24:00,940]  Right now, we're seeing no impact.\n",
            "[00:24:00,940 --> 00:24:08,940]  If anything, because of the slowdown of the COVID-19,\n",
            "[00:24:08,940 --> 00:24:14,970]  the countries are hit harder by COVID-19.\n",
            "[00:24:14,970 --> 00:24:16,970]  Essentially, those are in a lockdown.\n",
            "[00:24:16,970 --> 00:24:20,970]  Their 5G rollout activities have been slowed down.\n",
            "[00:24:20,970 --> 00:24:25,970]  So, if anything, that makes equipment more readily available\n",
            "[00:24:25,970 --> 00:24:27,970]  for countries like Taiwan.\n",
            "[00:24:27,970 --> 00:24:30,970]  So, right now, I think things are neutral.\n",
            "[00:24:30,970 --> 00:24:34,700]  Okay, thank you.\n",
            "[00:24:34,700 --> 00:24:35,700]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:24:35,700 --> 00:24:38,390]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:24:38,390 --> 00:24:40,550]  Once again, ladies and gentlemen,\n",
            "[00:24:40,550 --> 00:24:41,550]  star 1G for questions.\n",
            "[00:24:41,550 --> 00:25:03,370]  Next, we have a follow-up question from Jeff from Sinopec.\n",
            "[00:25:03,370 --> 00:25:08,640]  Thanks for giving me another chance.\n",
            "[00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:11,640]  Jeff, I have two questions.\n",
            "[00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:13,640]  My personal question is about,\n",
            "[00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:24,990]  will the company add more stores in Taiwan?\n",
            "[00:25:24,990 --> 00:25:33,990]  And will that help for the development in the future for the TWM?\n",
            "[00:25:33,990 --> 00:25:34,990]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:25:34,990 --> 00:25:36,990]  This is my personal question.\n",
            "[00:25:37,990 --> 00:25:57,520]  My second question is about our telecom in 2020.\n",
            "[00:25:57,520 --> 00:26:01,220]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:26:01,220 --> 00:26:02,220]  Thank you, Jeff.\n",
            "[00:26:02,220 --> 00:26:05,220]  So, right now, if you look at telecom players,\n",
            "[00:26:05,220 --> 00:26:07,220]  especially among the big three,\n",
            "[00:26:08,220 --> 00:26:14,220]  all of us are in the process of consolidating our stores.\n",
            "[00:26:14,220 --> 00:26:17,220]  But if you look at Taiwan Mobile's number,\n",
            "[00:26:17,220 --> 00:26:25,250]  we're actually reducing a lot less stores than our other big three peers.\n",
            "[00:26:25,250 --> 00:26:30,250]  So, essentially, we're stabilizing in terms of our store numbers.\n",
            "[00:26:30,250 --> 00:26:33,250]  Going forward, will we add more stores again?\n",
            "[00:26:33,250 --> 00:26:42,250]  It really depends on 5G take-up speed and the need for us to invest\n",
            "[00:26:42,250 --> 00:26:46,340]  in some of the local, faster-growing markets.\n",
            "[00:26:46,340 --> 00:26:49,340]  So, right now, that's an option,\n",
            "[00:26:49,340 --> 00:26:52,340]  but we haven't committed to any strategies yet.\n",
            "[00:26:52,340 --> 00:26:54,340]  In terms of 5G rate plan,\n",
            "[00:26:54,340 --> 00:26:58,340]  like I communicated with James from UBS before,\n",
            "[00:26:58,340 --> 00:27:05,340]  right now, it looks like the big three players have come to a consensus\n",
            "[00:27:05,340 --> 00:27:10,440]  on a rate plan around $1,400.\n",
            "[00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:16,440]  And we have been the first telecom company to offer that early-birth product\n",
            "[00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:23,440]  for people who are interested in 5G to sign up right now in the Taiwanese market.\n",
            "[00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:30,440]  And we're seeing healthy sign-ups by our existing 4G customers.\n",
            "[00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:38,440]  So, we don't expect the actual 5G rate plan to be too far from the $1,400\n",
            "[00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:43,440]  prevailed rate level by the market.\n",
            "[00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:48,440]  But in terms of how fast our pool will erode,\n",
            "[00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:56,250]  that is, right now, we'll need to observe.\n",
            "[00:27:56,250 --> 00:27:57,250]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:27:57,250 --> 00:27:58,250]  It's very helpful.\n",
            "[00:27:58,250 --> 00:27:59,280]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:27:59,280 --> 00:28:03,190]  Thank you, Jack.\n",
            "[00:28:03,190 --> 00:28:04,190]  Ladies and gentlemen,\n",
            "[00:28:04,190 --> 00:28:05,190]  should you like to raise a question,\n",
            "[00:28:05,190 --> 00:28:08,350]  please press Star 1 on your telephone keypad.\n",
            "[00:28:08,350 --> 00:28:28,650]  Ladies and gentlemen,\n",
            "[00:28:28,650 --> 00:28:30,650]  Star 1 keys for questions.\n",
            "[00:28:30,650 --> 00:28:41,340]  All right.\n",
            "[00:28:41,340 --> 00:28:42,340]  If we have no more questions,\n",
            "[00:28:42,340 --> 00:28:49,340]  may I propose that we conclude today's investor conference?\n",
            "[00:28:49,340 --> 00:28:52,340]  Thank you, everyone, for participating,\n",
            "[00:28:52,340 --> 00:28:55,340]  and we look forward to talking to you again next quarter.\n",

            "[00:00:09,350 --> 00:00:14,350]  Thank you. Good afternoon. Welcome to TeleMobile's fourth quarter 2019 investor conference call.\n",
            "[00:00:15,350 --> 00:00:21,350]  Before I start our presentation, I'd like to direct your attention to our disclaimer page, which states,\n",

            "[00:00:58,380 --> 00:01:05,380]  All right, let's look at the business overview. I would like to start with operational highlights of fourth quarter 2019.\n",
            "[00:01:06,380 --> 00:01:08,380]  Please turn to page four.\n",
            "[00:01:09,380 --> 00:01:17,380]  We're in an operating environment where customers continue to seek lower rate plans, delay their device upgrades in anticipation of 5G,\n",
            "[00:01:18,380 --> 00:01:23,380]  as well as using fewer paid voice minutes.\n",
            "[00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:27,420]  Despite all the headwinds the entire telecom industry faces,\n",
            "[00:01:28,420 --> 00:01:36,420]  TeleMobile managed to deliver outstanding results and turn our telecom eBid into positive YOY territory in 4Q 2019,\n",
            "[00:01:37,420 --> 00:01:41,420]  the first time since the Q2 2018 499 frenzy.\n",
            "[00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:47,960]  The results can be attributed to our successful efforts in upselling our new and existing customers.\n",
            "[00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:51,960]  The commendable momentum in double-play, so-called Â•ΩÈÄüÊàêÈõô,\n",
            "[00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:56,960]  unlimited mobile data and high-speed home broadband bundled plans,\n",
            "[00:01:58,380 --> 00:02:00,380]  and the successful launch of our Smarter Home business,\n",
            "[00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:10,380]  where we partnered with Google to bring its first Chinese-speaking smart speaker, the Google Nest Mini, to Taiwanese market in 4Q 2019.\n",
            "[00:02:11,540 --> 00:02:15,540]  Also, as importantly, MOMO continued to widen its lead in the e-commerce realm,\n",
            "[00:02:16,820 --> 00:02:20,820]  which we will dive deeper into in later slides.\n",
            "[00:02:21,980 --> 00:02:25,980]  As a result of our solid 4Q performance, for the four-year 2019,\n",
            "[00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:30,980]  TeleMobile was able to deliver net income that beat our guidance by 1%.\n",
            "[00:02:33,550 --> 00:02:38,550]  Now let me talk about our versatile strategy and results on page five.\n",
            "[00:02:39,550 --> 00:02:46,550]  During the quarter, we increased the monthly tariff on our handset bundled plans by $160.\n",
            "[00:02:47,550 --> 00:02:51,550]  The enterprise segment also continued to produce solid growth,\n",
            "[00:02:52,550 --> 00:02:59,550]  with IoT connections rising by 25% on the back of Tailwind from smart meters and connected cards.\n",
            "[00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:04,840]  Cloud service revenue rose by 15% thanks to solid IDC demand.\n",
            "[00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:12,130]  On the right-hand side of the slide, you can see that under our double-play Â•ΩÈÄüÊàêÈõô brand,\n",
            "[00:03:12,130 --> 00:03:18,130]  we offered unlimited mobile data services bundled with different speeds of home broadband services,\n",
            "[00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:23,160]  coupled with free video and music streaming and DTV subscription,\n",
            "[00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:30,160]  plus a complimentary Google Nest Mini smart speaker to enable voice command on your TV and smart home appliances,\n",
            "[00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:38,160]  all together at a very competitive price to what a stand-alone same-speed home broadband would cost from incumbents.\n",
            "[00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:46,320]  That is why our double-play products have proven to provide strong incentives for customers to sign up to higher rate plans\n",
            "[00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:51,320]  while at the same time position us to be a leader in the smarter home business.\n",
            "[00:03:56,510 --> 00:04:04,510]  Now turning to our paid TV business on page six, once again we fare better than other leading MSOs,\n",
            "[00:04:05,510 --> 00:04:10,510]  with the smallest loss in basic TV subscriptions and much higher broadband and DTV adoptions,\n",
            "[00:04:10,510 --> 00:04:13,510]  aided by our double-play bundle plans.\n",
            "[00:04:14,510 --> 00:04:19,510]  Not only do we continue to increase broadband and DTV penetration in our cable TV customer base,\n",
            "[00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:24,510]  we also made more strides in higher speed broadband take-up rates.\n",
            "[00:04:25,510 --> 00:04:33,610]  During the quarter, the percentage of customers subscribed to broadband plans with speeds of 100Mbps and higher\n",
            "[00:04:34,610 --> 00:04:36,610]  rose by 7 percentage points from a year ago.\n",
            "[00:04:38,980 --> 00:04:42,980]  Last but not least, on page seven, let's take a look at Momo.\n",
            "[00:04:43,980 --> 00:04:49,980]  In Q4, Momo once again outpaced its peers by growing speed-to-speed revenue by 33% YOY.\n",
            "[00:04:50,980 --> 00:04:53,980]  Thanks to market share gains in a growing online retail market,\n",
            "[00:04:54,980 --> 00:04:59,270]  average ticket size and number of transactions for customers were both higher,\n",
            "[00:05:00,270 --> 00:05:05,270]  SKUs further increased, and a private-label credit card was successfully launched.\n",
            "[00:05:05,270 --> 00:05:12,070]  Throughout the 2019 year, Momo also added 10 new satellite warehouses to further shorten its delivery time\n",
            "[00:05:13,070 --> 00:05:15,070]  and solidify its leadership position against peers.\n",
            "[00:05:16,070 --> 00:05:21,100]  Overall growth margin and operating margin have declined as Momo leaned towards growth\n",
            "[00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:24,100]  and investing in its logistic capabilities.\n",
            "[00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:30,100]  Over time, we expect profitability to improve as scale benefits and operating leverage kick in.\n",
            "[00:05:31,100 --> 00:05:34,650]  Now let me turn over the slide to Rosie for our financial overview.\n",
            "[00:05:35,650 --> 00:05:36,940]  Hi, good afternoon.\n",
            "[00:05:37,940 --> 00:05:45,190]  On the performance by business, on page nine, the reduced dealer commission,\n",
            "[00:05:46,190 --> 00:05:52,190]  lower interconnecting costs and spectrum usage fees helped us contain the year-on-year decline\n",
            "[00:05:53,190 --> 00:05:57,190]  in pre-IFR16 telecom EBITDA at 5% in the fourth quarter.\n",
            "[00:05:58,190 --> 00:06:03,420]  Telecom EBIT, however, went up by 1% year-on-year as DNA tapered off.\n",
            "[00:06:03,420 --> 00:06:09,830]  Reflecting the latest channel leasing pricing, we charged TV home shopping companies\n",
            "[00:06:10,830 --> 00:06:17,830]  pre-IFR16 cable TV EBITDA in the fourth quarter dropped by 11% year-on-year.\n",
            "[00:06:18,830 --> 00:06:27,830]  However, its EBIT increased by 6% year-on-year, aided by falling depreciation of set-up boxes.\n",
            "[00:06:28,830 --> 00:06:36,700]  As for Momo, in addition to its robust revenue growth, EBITDA also grew by 14% year-on-year\n",
            "[00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:44,240]  in the fourth quarter due to improved profitability in its businesses.\n",
            "[00:06:46,940 --> 00:06:49,940]  Now let's move to the results summary page.\n",
            "[00:06:50,940 --> 00:06:59,850]  In the fourth quarter, operating costs increased along with the growing e-commerce business\n",
            "[00:06:59,850 --> 00:07:06,200]  and hence itself. However, our consolidated operating income showed year-on-year growth\n",
            "[00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:12,360]  for the second consecutive quarter thanks to effective expense rationalization.\n",
            "[00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:18,840]  The low single-digit year-on-year decline in pre-tax and net income was mainly due to\n",
            "[00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:24,450]  one-off equipment write-off losses. For the full year of last year,\n",
            "[00:07:25,450 --> 00:07:28,610]  telecom EBIT came in ahead of our expectations.\n",
            "[00:07:28,610 --> 00:07:34,640]  While the combined EBIT of cable TV and Momo also surpassed our expectations,\n",
            "[00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:40,640]  accounting for 22% of our total EBIT in 2019.\n",
            "[00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:45,630]  Now let's turn to balance sheet analysis.\n",
            "[00:07:46,630 --> 00:07:54,260]  On the asset and liability front, the year-on-year surge in inventory and accounts payable\n",
            "[00:07:55,260 --> 00:07:59,260]  was driven by Momo's business expansion and solid iPhone demand.\n",
            "[00:07:59,260 --> 00:08:05,490]  Growth debt declined by 17% year-on-year to $43 billion\n",
            "[00:08:06,490 --> 00:08:13,840]  following CB holders' conversions and repayment of our 7-year straight bond matured in 2019.\n",
            "[00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:21,900]  As for shareholders' equity, the increase in paid-in capital and capital surplus\n",
            "[00:08:22,900 --> 00:08:26,900]  is reflective of the conversion of our convertible bonds,\n",
            "[00:08:27,900 --> 00:08:37,760]  which had an outstanding balance of $0.93 billion at the end of the fourth quarter last year.\n",
            "[00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:46,790]  As a result, share accounts for 2019 EPS calculation totaled 2.768 billion shares.\n",
            "[00:08:47,790 --> 00:08:57,940]  Benefiting from a lower debt, our net debt to pre-IFR 16 EBIT remained at a low level of 1.16 times.\n",
            "[00:08:58,940 --> 00:09:04,830]  Now let's turn to page 12 cash flow analysis.\n",
            "[00:09:07,590 --> 00:09:13,590]  The fourth quarter quarter-on-quarter and year-on-year drop in pre-IFR 16 operating cash flow\n",

            "[00:15:04,780 --> 00:15:07,780]  how much of the $11 billion CAFX for mobile\n",
            "[00:15:08,780 --> 00:15:10,780]  is specifically for 5G?\n",
            "[00:15:11,780 --> 00:15:14,780]  And secondly, what's driving the more aggressive thinking\n",

            "[00:15:18,780 --> 00:15:28,900]  The 5G CAFX actually is not over $9 billion for us.\n",

            "[00:15:36,670 --> 00:15:41,670]  So actually, our mobile CAFX is very similar to our peers.\n",

            "[00:16:27,670 --> 00:16:36,340]  we are expecting quite some level of savings\n",
            "[00:16:37,340 --> 00:16:42,340]  in terms of spectrum amortization versus our peers.\n",
            "[00:16:43,340 --> 00:16:52,500]  So even if we would incur similar amount of network CAFX,\n",
            "[00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:56,500]  we're still in a much better position financially.\n",

            "[00:17:01,650 --> 00:17:04,650]  But the $9 billion still looks a bit higher than your peers.\n",
            "[00:17:05,650 --> 00:17:09,650]  Does that mean that for the less spending on amortization\n",
            "[00:17:10,650 --> 00:17:14,650]  will be going into CAFX and resulting in depreciation\n",

            "[00:17:23,620 --> 00:17:28,100]  What we understand is we're spending similar amount\n",

            "[00:17:30,100 --> 00:17:35,100]  In terms of the year after, we will comment once we have\n",
            "[00:17:36,100 --> 00:17:37,100]  our CAFX plan approved by the board.\n",
            "[00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:40,920]  Okay.\n",
            "[00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:44,920]  For the guided DNA of around $16 billion for this year,\n",
            "[00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:47,920]  do we have the respective number on depreciation\n",
            "[00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:49,920]  and amortization?\n",
            "[00:17:56,970 --> 00:17:57,970]  No, we don't disclose the number.\n",
            "[00:17:58,970 --> 00:18:00,970]  Well, amortization is quite straightforward.\n",
            "[00:18:01,970 --> 00:18:05,970]  We will amortize the new 5G spectrum.\n",
            "[00:18:05,970 --> 00:18:08,970]  Over the 20-year period.\n",
            "[00:18:09,970 --> 00:18:11,700]  And for the existing one,\n",
            "[00:18:12,700 --> 00:18:14,700]  the amortization expense will stay the same.\n",
            "[00:18:15,700 --> 00:18:18,460]  Okay.\n",

            "[00:47:30,160 --> 00:47:31,160]  but since 5G\n",
            "[00:47:32,160 --> 00:47:33,160]  launch is really\n",
            "[00:47:34,160 --> 00:47:35,160]  in Q3,\n",
            "[00:47:36,160 --> 00:47:37,160]  we'll have a more clear view\n",
            "[00:47:38,160 --> 00:47:41,160]  the next time we have this conference.\n",
            "[00:47:43,980 --> 00:47:44,980]  Okay. Thank you, sir.\n",
            "[00:47:49,150 --> 00:47:50,150]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:47:51,150 --> 00:47:52,150]  Once again, ladies and gentlemen,\n",
            "[00:48:00,030 --> 00:48:01,030]  there is still one queue for questions.\n",
            "[00:48:02,030 --> 00:48:03,030]  Once again, ladies and gentlemen,\n",
            "[00:48:08,480 --> 00:48:09,480]  there is still one queue for questions.\n",
            "[00:48:10,480 --> 00:48:11,480]  Excuse me, Mr. Lin,\n",
            "[00:48:12,510 --> 00:48:13,510]  but thank you.\n",

            "[00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:08,000]  Good morning, good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to the conference call. Our chairperson today is Mr. Jamie Lin. Mr. Lin, please begin your call, and I'll be standing by for the Q&A. Thank you.\n",
            "[00:00:10,310 --> 00:00:16,310]  Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to Taiwan Mobile's third quarter 2019 semester conference call.\n",
            "[00:00:17,310 --> 00:00:23,310]  Before I start our presentation, I would like to direct your attention to our disclaimer page, which states,\n",

            "[00:01:00,310 --> 00:01:06,470]  All right, let's start with the business overview. I'll start with the operating performance of our telecom business.\n",
            "[00:01:09,100 --> 00:01:19,100]  So please turn to page four. In the third quarter, Taiwan Mobile outgrew the overall market in telecom revenue as we rolled off the tougher pre-99-based in-service revenue\n",
            "[00:01:19,100 --> 00:01:25,100]  and recorded strong device sales from ICT projects and increased handset sales.\n",
            "[00:01:26,260 --> 00:01:36,260]  Thanks to mobile rate plan profit rationalization and superior spectrum yield, Taiwan Mobile posted the smallest worldwide decline in telecom EBIT for the third quarter.\n",
            "[00:01:37,260 --> 00:01:44,730]  Now let's talk about Taiwan Mobile's versatile telecom strategy.\n",
            "[00:01:45,730 --> 00:01:51,730]  With the launch of iPhone 11, we saw an upbeat increase in our third quarter iPhone bundle sales.\n",
            "[00:01:52,730 --> 00:01:58,730]  Additionally, our ongoing upselling effort via promoting non-headset bundle plans yielded strong results.\n",
            "[00:01:59,730 --> 00:02:07,020]  Sign-ups for NT99 and higher rate plans more than doubled during the quarter.\n",
            "[00:02:08,020 --> 00:02:16,020]  The collaboration with SYN group companies also took further steps during the quarter as we introduced new digital convergence plans,\n",
            "[00:02:17,020 --> 00:02:21,020]  which consist of high-speed broadband and unlimited mobile data services.\n",
            "[00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:31,020]  The launch of the Taiwan Mobile store pickups for MOMO purchases has increased significantly broadened business opportunities for both parties as well.\n",
            "[00:02:32,020 --> 00:02:43,020]  As for the enterprise segment, ICT cloud and IoT services recorded healthy growth on the back of new customer wins and increasing demand for M2M connectivity.\n",
            "[00:02:44,020 --> 00:02:53,180]  For IoT connectivity, we saw tailwind on connected cars, smart lighting, and we expected it to accelerate in the next few quarters.\n",
            "[00:02:53,180 --> 00:03:10,510]  Turning to our pay TV business, again, we fared better than other leading MSOs with smaller losses in basic TV subscription and much higher broadband and DTV adoptions with the help of convergence.\n",
            "[00:03:11,510 --> 00:03:21,610]  Not only did we continue to increase broadband and DTV penetration in our cable TV customer base, we also made more strides in higher-speed broadband take-up.\n",
            "[00:03:24,430 --> 00:03:34,460]  Moving on to MOMO, as we mentioned in last quarter, MOMO remains one of the few e-commerce platforms that have delivered stable profits.\n",
            "[00:03:35,460 --> 00:03:50,460]  In the third quarter, MOMO once again outpaced its peers by growing its B2C revenue by 31% year-over-year, thanks to higher average ticket size and number of transactions, increasing SKUs plus collecting via Taiwan Mobile.\n",
            "[00:03:51,460 --> 00:04:11,500]  Overall, gross margin was stable despite the rising contribution from 3C and home appliances in the B2C product mix, while operating margin also grew year-over-year as a result of cost rationalization in TV shopping business and operating leverage from B2C business.\n",
            "[00:04:13,100 --> 00:04:16,100]  Now, let me turn over the presentation to Rosie for our financial overview.\n",
            "[00:04:17,710 --> 00:04:18,710]  Hi. Good afternoon.\n",
            "[00:04:19,810 --> 00:04:39,670]  In the third quarter of 2019, the year-on-year decline in pre-IFR16 telecom EBITDA decelerated to 4% as we rolled off the tough pre-499 base and had lower dealer commissions, interconnecting costs and spectrum usage fees.\n",
            "[00:04:40,670 --> 00:04:53,900]  Pre-IFR16 cable TV EBITDA dipped by 5% year-on-year due to market competition, but EBITDA still grew by 13% as a result of falling depreciation of set-up boxes.\n",
            "[00:04:55,120 --> 00:05:02,120]  As for MOMO, in addition to its robust revenue growth, EBITDA surged by 26% year-on-year in the third quarter.\n",
            "[00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:05,410]  Let's move to the results summary page.\n",
            "[00:05:06,410 --> 00:05:17,700]  We are delighted to see that the year-on-year trend in overall operating income turned positive for the first time this year.\n",
            "[00:05:18,930 --> 00:05:29,930]  In addition to the easier base mentioned earlier, effective cost control in MOMO's legacy business and its strong operating leverage were key factors in bringing about a solid performance.\n",
            "[00:05:30,930 --> 00:05:37,930]  Meanwhile, the uptick in dividend income and the decrease in interest expenses caused non-operating expenses to plummet.\n",
            "[00:05:38,930 --> 00:05:51,920]  Overall, operating income for all major businesses was within management expectations for the first three quarters, and net income reached 77% of the company's full-year guidance.\n",
            "[00:05:56,280 --> 00:06:21,350]  On the balance sheet, on the asset and liability front, the year-on-year surge in cash and accounts payable was driven mainly by MOMO's payments that were delayed by the typhoon holiday on September 30, followed by MOMO's continuous growth and a more optimistic iPhone launch.\n",
            "[00:06:21,350 --> 00:06:26,510]  Growth debt declined by 15% year-on-year following CB holder's conversion.\n",
            "[00:06:27,510 --> 00:06:40,860]  As for shareholders' equity, the increase in paying capital and capital surplus reflects the conversion hour CB, which had an outstanding balance of $2.27 billion at the end of the third quarter.\n",
            "[00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:51,860]  Looking at the ratios, the sequential hike in current ratio was within the seasonal pattern as we pay the accrued dividends payable in the third quarter.\n",
            "[00:06:52,860 --> 00:07:00,860]  Benefiting from lower debt, our net debt to pre-IPAS 16 EBITDA remained at a low level of 1.16 times.\n",
            "[00:07:00,860 --> 00:07:34,500]  Moving on to our cash flow analysis, now that the rental expenses are classified as financial cash flow as opposed to the operating cash flow after the adoption of IPAS 16 in this year, comparing on the same base, our third quarter pre-IPAS 16 operating cash flow still showed a year-on-year increase, even with the exclusion of the typhoon holiday payable increase.\n",
            "[00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:45,050]  The increase in investing cash outflow was due to a higher inflow from the guaranteed deposits we took back in the third quarter a year ago.\n",
            "[00:07:46,050 --> 00:07:56,050]  As for the financing activities, the net outflow was the result of dividend payments, which were mostly funded by an expansion in short-term borrowings.\n",
            "[00:07:57,050 --> 00:08:13,100]  The cumulative capex for the first three quarters declined year-on-year as we approached 4G spending late cycle, combined with MOMO's high capex base from the warehouse built last year.\n",
            "[00:08:14,330 --> 00:08:26,330]  After adjusting for the typhoon-related one-off payment delay, our free cash flow for the first three quarters was flat year-on-year, owing to lower capex and higher operating cash flow.\n",
            "[00:08:27,420 --> 00:08:31,420]  Now let me turn the presentation back to Jamie for event updates and key messages.\n",
            "[00:08:32,420 --> 00:08:36,420]  All right, so now let's turn to the 5G spectrum auction slide.\n",
            "[00:08:37,420 --> 00:08:43,420]  This slide summarizes the key information with regards to the upcoming 5G spectrum auction.\n",
            "[00:08:44,420 --> 00:08:51,420]  The auction is scheduled to begin on the 10th of December this year, and we expect it to conclude late December or early January next year.\n",
            "[00:08:52,420 --> 00:09:06,650]  For the mainstream 3.5 GHz frequency band, a total of 270 MHz are available for auction with a floor price of $24.3 billion NT.\n",
            "[00:09:07,650 --> 00:09:14,650]  The rollout requirement is 1,000 base stations and 50% population coverage in five years.\n",
            "[00:09:15,810 --> 00:09:22,810]  Note that the rollout obligation applies to all successful bidders, regardless of bandwidth 1.\n",
            "[00:09:24,030 --> 00:09:37,030]  Furthermore, the second stage of the auction may not take place if the bidders come to an agreement with regards to location after the first stage of the auction.\n",
            "[00:09:39,020 --> 00:09:53,180]  Moving on to our capex update, MOMO's board of directors approved an additional capex of $630 million NT to purchase a parcel of land for its south distribution center.\n",
            "[00:09:54,180 --> 00:10:06,180]  Subsequently, Taiwan Mobile's financial year 2019 consolidated capex guidance was revised to $7.1 billion NT from $6.4 billion previously.\n",
            "[00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:14,280]  The second part of this slide summarizes the awards and recognitions we received in the third quarter for your reference.\n",
            "[00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:22,400]  Finally, to wrap up our presentation, this slide summarizes the key message that we would like to deliver.\n",
            "[00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:28,820]  Margins disciplines have contributed to our operating income growth in the third quarter of 2019.\n",
            "[00:10:29,820 --> 00:10:33,820]  Free cash flow stability provides good visibility to shareholder returns.\n",
            "[00:10:34,820 --> 00:10:45,820]  Looking ahead, efforts to extend our business value chains would be a long-term growth driver for Taiwan Mobile, besides satisfactory earnings growth contributing from e-commerce business.\n",
            "[00:10:46,820 --> 00:10:49,820]  Thank you. Now I would like to open the floor up for Q&A session.\n",
            "[00:10:50,820 --> 00:10:59,640]  Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, we will now open for questions. If you would like to register for a question, please press star 1 on your telephone. Thank you.\n",
            "[00:11:13,340 --> 00:11:17,340]  Our first question comes from Jeff Xu with SANA Securities in Taipei. Thank you.\n",
            "[00:11:18,340 --> 00:11:25,460]  Good afternoon and also thanks for giving me the chance to ask a question. I have two questions.\n",
            "[00:11:26,460 --> 00:11:36,740]  First, I just want to make sure about the capex because we see the capex increase from the second quarter.\n",
            "[00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:51,970]  And so could you give us about the reason? Is the TWN field the new best station or something else? This is the first question.\n",
            "[00:11:52,970 --> 00:12:06,220]  And my second question is about the 5G because according to the information, the auction will maybe start in December.\n",
            "[00:12:07,220 --> 00:12:18,220]  So could you give us some colors about the strategy, the TWN strategy in the 5G spectrum auction? Thank you.\n",
            "[00:12:19,220 --> 00:12:28,180]  For your first question, the mobile capex in the third quarter increased slightly from the second quarter.\n",
            "[00:12:29,180 --> 00:12:37,180]  It's more of a timing issue, but for the whole year, our mobile capex was still within the guidance.\n",
            "[00:12:38,180 --> 00:12:44,180]  And compared to 2018, 2019's mobile capex will still be lower than a year ago.\n",
            "[00:12:45,180 --> 00:13:01,830]  And Jeff, in terms of 5G auction strategy, I think that is more difficult for us to share that because all of our competitors would be listening.\n",
            "[00:13:02,830 --> 00:13:07,830]  But in terms of 5G strategy overall, we have expressed that we're going to be methodical about it.\n",
            "[00:13:07,830 --> 00:13:16,830]  We see it as a 10 to 20-year process. We're going to participate, but we're going to be rational about it. Thank you.\n",
            "[00:13:17,830 --> 00:13:27,340]  Okay. Thank you, sir. Just one follow-up question. And could you give us about your viewpoint for the iPhone 11?\n",
            "[00:13:28,340 --> 00:13:42,620]  Because the sales in the telecom still has good news. So what's your viewpoint for the iPhone 11 sales?\n",
            "[00:13:43,620 --> 00:13:54,420]  Will the sales beat the almost same revenue in 2017 or 2016? Thank you.\n",
            "[00:13:54,420 --> 00:14:07,480]  Thank you, Jeff. So we continue to observe stronger iPhone sales than the previous year. We're right now feeling pretty good about it.\n",
            "[00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:23,580]  But when will the party end is a harder question. So of course, we would like for the party to continue to go on for a long time.\n",
            "[00:14:24,580 --> 00:14:26,180]  Thank you, sir.\n",
            "[00:14:27,180 --> 00:14:50,480]  Thank you. Once again, ladies and gentlemen, that is all 1Q4 questions. Our next question comes from Peter Milken with Deutsche Bank in Hong Kong. Please go ahead.\n",
            "[00:14:51,480 --> 00:15:04,830]  Hi. Good afternoon. A question about the 5G auction. Any thoughts on the cost of rolling out 1,000 base stations and 50% population coverage on the 3.5 GHz?\n",
            "[00:15:04,830 --> 00:15:11,830]  And related to that, is it expected that all five telcos will bid in the auction? Thanks.\n",
            "[00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:43,590]  Thank you, Peter. So in terms of the cost, we have said in the press before that we're expecting each station to cost anywhere between US$100,000 to US$200,000,\n",
            "[00:15:43,590 --> 00:16:05,690]  depending on the actual vendor and actual technology you choose. So if you time that by 1,000, and then of course you need to add on top the core, then you get a pretty close ballpark of the actual capex you'll have to spend in terms of rolling out the first 1,000 stations.\n",
            "[00:16:06,690 --> 00:16:18,690]  In terms of covering 50% of the population, it takes anywhere between 4,000 to 6,000 stations, depending on your deployment strategy.\n",
            "[00:16:23,180 --> 00:16:30,180]  Okay. Thank you for that. And has there been any word on whether all five companies are still looking to bid?\n",
            "[00:16:31,270 --> 00:16:49,270]  I'm sorry. So yes, the authority did share with us, and it's also public information, that all five mobile carriers have submitted their application, but we have no idea if other players are committed to participate in the bidding.\n",
            "[00:16:49,270 --> 00:17:05,560]  And also, there's going to be an interview process. There's also a slight chance the authority might decide or disqualify applicants if they so deem fair.\n",
            "[00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:35,520]  Got it. And one final question from me. Your key message on the last page of the presentation includes a statement, looking ahead, efforts to extend our business value chains would be long-term growth drivers for Taiwan Mobile. Those business value chains, is that referring to MoMo and IoT-type things, or is there more to it that I might be missing? Thanks.\n",
            "[00:17:37,640 --> 00:18:04,800]  Yes, Peter. So I think you got us correct. We talked a little bit about the collaboration or the convergence between us and our mobile business and our cable business, also our telecom business and our e-commerce business. And looking forward, we see these type of vertical integration as a key growth driver for our longer-term value generation.\n",
            "[00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:08,470]  Got it. Hey, that's great. Thank you very much.\n",
            "[00:18:08,470 --> 00:18:09,470]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:18:09,470 --> 00:18:15,270]  Thank you. Our next question comes from Emerald Lee with Yuen Tai in Taiwan. Please go ahead.\n",
            "[00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:27,200]  Hi. I have one follow-up about the cost per base station. So that number was for 5G. What about 4G? What was the cost in past years?\n",
            "[00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:48,250]  Thanks, Emerald. So 5G per base station is two to four times more expensive than 4G. If you want to look at the multiple, that's the ballpark.\n",
            "[00:18:51,710 --> 00:18:52,710]  Okay, thanks.\n",
            "[00:18:52,710 --> 00:19:14,620]  Thank you. Once again, ladies and gentlemen, that is all we have for questions.\n",
            "[00:19:18,020 --> 00:19:22,020]  And next, we have a follow-up question from Jeff Hsu with Sino Securities. Please go ahead.\n",
            "[00:19:23,020 --> 00:19:41,490]  Okay. Thank you, sir. I just have two first questions. So right now, will we change our financial forecast for the whole year? This is my first question.\n",
            "[00:19:41,490 --> 00:20:00,160]  And my second question is about ‚Äì so how about the cable business? Because recently, we get information from your peers, they say the price competition is still fear.\n",
            "[00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:14,160]  So will the company to maybe ‚Äì what's the strategy for your company to face this kind of situation? Thank you.\n",
            "[00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:38,880]  We don't have any plan to change our forecast for this year. And for cable TV competition, the current competition is not in the areas that we provide services. And longer term, we will sell more services into the same household. That's the way that we grow the business.\n",
            "[00:20:41,580 --> 00:21:02,860]  Yeah, Jeff, if you look at our DTV and broadband penetration, we're one of the highest among our peers. And one of the reasons ‚Äì and we're also growing at one of the fastest speed in terms of those two sort of services that we provide within the realm of home business.\n",
            "[00:21:02,860 --> 00:21:23,860]  And going forward ‚Äì and one of the reasons is because of the convergence type of bundled packages that we offer as a group. And going forward, we see acceleration in terms of providing bundled packages through our convergence program.\n",
            "[00:21:24,860 --> 00:21:33,860]  So we're probably going to continue to grow our DTV and broadband products much faster than our peers.\n",
            "[00:21:36,620 --> 00:22:07,460]  So just one follow-up question. So right now, our depreciation ‚Äì depreciation ‚Äì the cost of the ‚Äì our cable TV, could you give us about the numbers about that for the whole year or just one season?\n",
            "[00:22:10,730 --> 00:22:15,730]  Actually, if you go to our website, we do have the details that you are looking for.\n",
            "[00:22:16,730 --> 00:22:18,340]  Okay, thank you. Thank you, sir.\n",
            "[00:22:19,340 --> 00:22:21,650]  Thank you, Jeff.\n",
            "[00:22:24,020 --> 00:22:54,940]  Thank you. Once again, ladies and gentlemen, if you'd like to register for questions, please press star-one on your telephone. Thank you. Once again, ladies and gentlemen, there is star-one key for questions. Once again, ladies and gentlemen, there is star-one key for questions.\n",
            "[00:23:01,610 --> 00:23:03,610]  Mr. Lin, there seems to be no further questions at this point in time. Thank you.\n",
            "[00:23:04,610 --> 00:23:15,240]  All right. Thank you, guys, very much for dialing into this quarter's earnings conference call. We look forward to talking to you again next quarter.\n",
            "[00:23:18,190 --> 00:23:20,190]  Thank you for your participation. This concludes the conference.\n"

            "[00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000]  Good morning, good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to the conference call.\n",
            "[00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:10,310]  The chairperson today is Mr. Jamie Lin. Mr. Lin, please begin your call and I'll have you stand by for the Q&A. Thank you.\n",
            "[00:00:10,310 --> 00:00:15,310]  All right. Good afternoon. Welcome to TeleMobile's second quarter 2019 investor conference call.\n",
            "[00:00:15,310 --> 00:00:22,310]  Before I start our presentation, I would like to direct your attention to our disclaimer page, which states,\n",

            "[00:01:01,070 --> 00:01:13,150]  All right. Let's turn to business overview. I'll start with the operating performance of our telecom business.\n",
            "[00:01:13,150 --> 00:01:19,150]  So let's just take a look at trends in the overall telecom market.\n",
            "[00:01:19,150 --> 00:01:28,150]  After the 499 frenzy last year, not only are the majority of consumers locked into contracts with the big three,\n",
            "[00:01:28,150 --> 00:01:35,150]  but the gap in monthly rates between the big three and the two smaller players has narrowed meaningfully.\n",
            "[00:01:35,150 --> 00:01:44,440]  Therefore, the smaller players' YOY decline in telecom revenue has further deteriorated, in spite of extra promotional efforts.\n",
            "[00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:54,540]  The big three, on the other hand, are seeing stabilization in YOY revenue trends, even with last year's high rates from penalty income.\n",
            "[00:01:54,540 --> 00:02:00,630]  As for mobile service revenue, despite the steeper YOY decline in 2Q,\n",
            "[00:02:00,630 --> 00:02:11,920]  TWM still posts higher spectrum yield than our peers, as shown in the bottom left chart, thanks to TWM's superior spectrum investment strategy.\n",
            "[00:02:14,620 --> 00:02:20,710]  Now let's talk about our mobile strategy for consumers.\n",
            "[00:02:20,710 --> 00:02:26,810]  To overcome the headwind on ARPU from customer shifting to SIM-only plans,\n",
            "[00:02:26,810 --> 00:02:32,810]  in addition to promoting iPhone bundles, we have also enhanced our bundle plan offerings,\n",
            "[00:02:32,810 --> 00:02:39,970]  such as bundling handsets plus home appliance products, so-called red plus green.\n",
            "[00:02:39,970 --> 00:02:46,970]  To encourage customers to sign up for higher monthly rate plans, and the results have been very encouraging.\n",
            "[00:02:46,970 --> 00:02:54,380]  As for the enterprise segment, we posted decent growth in a diverse set of cloud-based services,\n",
            "[00:02:54,380 --> 00:03:07,770]  including hybrid cloud, information security solutions, cloud PBX, which stands for private branch exchange services, etc.\n",
            "[00:03:07,770 --> 00:03:12,120]  We were also able to produce new customer wins.\n",
            "[00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:18,120]  For IoT connectivity, the up-beat growth is stemming from our wins in government smart city projects\n",
            "[00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:24,440]  and other opportunities, such as Internet of Vehicles and smart meters.\n",
            "[00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:33,440]  Last but not least, we posted very strong ICT service growth, as we strive to provide integrated solutions to our enterprise customers,\n",
            "[00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:41,460]  from equipment procurement to data center design and to cloud and IoT services.\n",
            "[00:03:41,460 --> 00:03:43,460]  Next is our pay TV business.\n",
            "[00:03:43,460 --> 00:03:50,740]  We fared better versus other leading MSOs, with a smaller loss in base SIG TV subscription.\n",
            "[00:03:50,740 --> 00:04:02,060]  To provide tailwind to our ARPU, we managed to grow customer adoption rates of DTV and broadband services as of 2019.\n",
            "[00:04:02,060 --> 00:04:11,500]  To strengthen customer stickiness, we are getting ready to release a new cross-sell bundle package in 2H this year.\n",
            "[00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:17,500]  Moving on to Momo, let's take a quick look at Taiwan's e-commerce market first.\n",
            "[00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:26,570]  Momo is currently the number one player and is one of the few e-commerce platforms that have delivered stable profits.\n",
            "[00:04:26,570 --> 00:04:33,600]  In 2Q, Momo once again outpaced its peers by growing its B2C revenue by 30% YOY.\n",
            "[00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:45,600]  While growth margins edged down due to 3C's rising share in the product mix, operating margins still grew YOY thanks to economies of scale.\n",
            "[00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:52,620]  Let me turn over the presentation to Rosie for our financial overview.\n",
            "[00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:54,620]  Hi, good afternoon.\n",
            "[00:04:54,620 --> 00:04:59,170]  Let me talk about the performance by business.\n",
            "[00:04:59,170 --> 00:05:13,780]  In the 2Q, Taiwan Mobile's consolidated revenue rose by 4% YOY as Momo's strong e-commerce revenue growth compensated for the decline in mobile service and pay TV revenue.\n",
            "[00:05:13,780 --> 00:05:22,350]  Pre-IFR16 EBITDA for telecom business faced a high base due to the 499 frenzy,\n",
            "[00:05:22,350 --> 00:05:34,450]  but the year-on-year decline had already started to stabilize in June, aided by lessened revenue headwind and savings in traffic costs and selling expenses.\n",
            "[00:05:34,450 --> 00:05:52,080]  For pay TV business, even though pre-IFR16 EBITDA dipped by 3% due to softer basic TV revenue, operating income grew by 11%, a function of falling depreciation of set-up boxes.\n",
            "[00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:55,750]  Let's go to the results summary page.\n",
            "[00:05:55,750 --> 00:06:09,120]  In the 2Q, the combined operating income of pay TV and Momo increased by 9% YOY, helping mitigate the decline in telecom operating income.\n",
            "[00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:20,730]  For the first half of the year, the slight miss in total revenue from weak telecom performance was offset by lower traffic costs and selling expenses.\n",
            "[00:06:22,660 --> 00:06:34,030]  Overall, operating income for all major businesses was within management expectations, and net income also reached companies' guidance.\n",
            "[00:06:34,030 --> 00:06:45,470]  On the balance sheet analysis, the significant drop in other current assets was because of the reversal of interim payments accrued a year ago.\n",
            "[00:06:45,470 --> 00:06:50,570]  The increase in inventory is the result of Momo's expansion.\n",
            "[00:06:50,570 --> 00:07:10,040]  On the liability front, the leverage on the back of our healthy free cash flow coupled with conversion of our CB, our growth debt declined by 22% year-on-year to $37.4 billion.\n",
            "[00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:16,780]  The outstanding CB amount at the end of June was $5.1 billion.\n",
            "[00:07:16,780 --> 00:07:28,580]  As for shareholder's equity, CB conversion value also caused our paid-in capital and capital surplus to go up by $3.5 billion in the second quarter.\n",
            "[00:07:28,580 --> 00:07:39,700]  Our net debt to pre-IFR 16 EBITDA ratio further improved to 1.03 times, thanks to lower debt.\n",
            "[00:07:39,700 --> 00:07:44,690]  Now let's turn to the cash flow analysis page.\n",
            "[00:07:44,690 --> 00:07:58,060]  For operating cash flow, the year-on-year decline in the second quarter reflected not only the decline in pre-tax earnings, but also a higher corporate tax rate on higher taxable income.\n",
            "[00:07:58,060 --> 00:08:13,120]  For investing cash flow, the year-on-year increase in outflow in spite of falling capex was attributable to higher cash inflows from some redemptions in the previous year.\n",
            "[00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:25,270]  For financing activities, the net cash outflow mainly came from debt repayment and cash dividend payments to MOMO's minority shareholders.\n",
            "[00:08:25,270 --> 00:08:41,910]  As to our free cash flow, the free cash flow yield of 5.6% at the end of second quarter still stood higher than our dividend yield, despite the negative impact from lower operating cash flow.\n",
            "[00:08:41,910 --> 00:08:48,710]  Now let me turn the presentation over to Jamie for event updates and key messages.\n",
            "[00:08:48,710 --> 00:08:57,870]  Alright, so the awards and recognitions slide summarizes the awards and recognitions we have received in the second quarter for your reference.\n",
            "[00:08:57,870 --> 00:09:04,870]  And then finally, to wrap up our presentation, we have a key message that we would like to deliver.\n",
            "[00:09:04,870 --> 00:09:12,870]  Taiwan Mobile started seeing improved fundamentals with June operating results stabilized compared with a year ago.\n",
            "[00:09:12,870 --> 00:09:21,870]  Joining forces with digital leaders including MOMO and AdWords companies to offer compelling service bundles will prove to be our winning strategy.\n",
            "[00:09:23,030 --> 00:09:37,060]  Looking forward, as we approach the tail end of 4G deployment, we will be in a good position with more financial flexibility to make strategic moves, expand our footprint and generate healthy returns for our shareholders.\n",
            "[00:09:37,060 --> 00:09:41,610]  With that, I would like to open the floor for Q&A session.\n",
            "[00:09:41,610 --> 00:09:54,980]  Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, we will now open for questions. If you would like to register for a question, please press star 1 on your telephone. Thank you.\n",
            "[00:09:54,980 --> 00:10:00,660]  Our first question comes from Neil Anderson with HSBC in Hong Kong. Thank you.\n",
            "[00:10:00,660 --> 00:10:10,660]  Hi there. Good afternoon. I'd just like to ask about the TV business in terms of the softness and the basic TV revenues.\n",
            "[00:10:10,660 --> 00:10:17,660]  Could you elaborate a bit there? I think, Rosie, you mentioned an increase in other operating income.\n",
            "[00:10:17,660 --> 00:10:21,660]  So that's the first question relating to the TV sector.\n",
            "[00:10:21,660 --> 00:10:28,660]  And then on the cost side, I think you mentioned lower traffic cost as one of the offsetting factors in the quarter.\n",
            "[00:10:28,660 --> 00:10:38,420]  Why is that? Is that likely to continue? That would be very helpful. Thank you.\n",
            "[00:10:38,420 --> 00:10:45,100]  Well, for the TV business, the earnings increase came largely from a much lower depreciation expense.\n",
            "[00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:53,570]  As the set-top boxes that were procured a few years ago, the majority of those have depreciated.\n",
            "[00:10:53,570 --> 00:11:02,760]  And then for the telecom business, the traffic cost decrease was due to the lower interconnecting rate.\n",
            "[00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:07,840]  Got it. Okay. Thank you very much.\n",
            "[00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:13,840]  The rate has been lower and we also have lower minutes of use.\n",
            "[00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:16,640]  I see. Thank you.\n",
            "[00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:22,600]  Thank you. Once again, ladies and gentlemen, that is star 1 key for questions.\n",
            "[00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:37,090]  Once again, ladies and gentlemen, that is star 1 key for questions.\n",
            "[00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:52,880]  Our next question comes from Jack Hsu with SinoPAC in Taiwan. Please go ahead.\n",
            "[00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:57,880]  Okay. Thanks for giving me the chance to ask questions. I have two questions.\n",
            "[00:11:57,880 --> 00:12:05,910]  The first question, the company will change our financial forecast in the following years.\n",
            "[00:12:05,910 --> 00:12:07,910]  And this is my first question.\n",
            "[00:12:07,910 --> 00:12:17,910]  And my second question is, what is our viewpoint for 5G in the future, especially for the TWN?\n",
            "[00:12:17,910 --> 00:12:24,910]  And what is our advantage when we develop the 5G?\n",
            "[00:12:24,910 --> 00:12:30,910]  And what is our disadvantage when we develop the 5G? Thank you.\n",
            "[00:12:30,910 --> 00:12:35,900]  Let me answer your first question on financial forecast.\n",
            "[00:12:36,900 --> 00:12:42,900]  We haven't started doing our financial forecast for the next year.\n",
            "[00:12:42,900 --> 00:12:50,900]  And if you are talking about the second half, we don't have any plan to revise our financial forecast.\n",
            "[00:12:50,900 --> 00:12:59,540]  And in terms of 5G, we're seeing it as a long-term play.\n",
            "[00:12:59,540 --> 00:13:03,540]  So the 5G license will be a 20-year license.\n",
            "[00:13:04,630 --> 00:13:15,720]  So we're going to be methodical about it.\n",
            "[00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:24,490]  In terms of bidding, we're going to consider that confidential.\n",
            "[00:13:24,490 --> 00:13:30,490]  And in terms of 5G business model, like we communicated before,\n",
            "[00:13:30,490 --> 00:13:49,490]  we will be working with services to build end-to-end integrated solutions on top of horizontal connectivity products.\n",
            "[00:13:49,490 --> 00:14:02,430]  So can we say it will start from the IoT, and then we will go to other segments, right?\n",
            "[00:14:04,740 --> 00:14:12,740]  So IoT is definitely a key piece of the puzzle in terms of 5G service offerings.\n",
            "[00:14:12,740 --> 00:14:21,260]  But it depends on the vertical that you're going after.\n",
            "[00:14:21,260 --> 00:14:32,260]  So like we communicated before, with 5G, we're going after verticals such as industry use, medical use, retail use,\n",
            "[00:14:32,260 --> 00:14:36,930]  smart cities, et cetera.\n",
            "[00:14:36,930 --> 00:14:48,220]  So in a lot of these different verticals, we see there will be a need to integrate IoT products\n",
            "[00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:54,220]  to offer the best sort of solutions for these industry uses.\n",
            "[00:14:54,220 --> 00:14:56,910]  Okay, I see.\n",
            "[00:14:56,910 --> 00:14:58,910]  Sorry, just one follow-up question.\n",
            "[00:14:59,910 --> 00:15:06,520]  What's our viewpoint for the cable business in the second half of the year?\n",
            "[00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:12,520]  Because any chance for growth in the second half?\n",
            "[00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:13,520]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:28,930]  I think the overall market is still facing headwinds in terms of subscriber retention.\n",
            "[00:15:28,930 --> 00:15:34,930]  But we will continue to push our DTV and broadband services.\n",
            "[00:15:34,930 --> 00:15:40,930]  Right now, the penetration rate of these two services are still below 50%.\n",
            "[00:15:40,930 --> 00:15:47,930]  So we see a lot of upside in terms of signing up our customers to these services.\n",
            "[00:15:47,930 --> 00:15:56,370]  But will the price competition in this segment be fierce?\n",
            "[00:15:59,380 --> 00:16:05,380]  We don't see price competition to intensify in the second half of the year.\n",
            "[00:16:05,380 --> 00:16:08,380]  But these things are hard to say.\n",
            "[00:16:08,380 --> 00:16:10,380]  Okay, I see.\n",
            "[00:16:10,380 --> 00:16:11,380]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:16:11,380 --> 00:16:12,410]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:16:12,410 --> 00:16:14,460]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:16:14,460 --> 00:16:18,460]  Next, we have a follow-up question from Noah Emerson with HSBC Hong Kong.\n",
            "[00:16:18,460 --> 00:16:19,460]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:16:19,460 --> 00:16:21,900]  Hi there.\n",
            "[00:16:21,900 --> 00:16:22,900]  Sorry, I just have one more.\n",
            "[00:16:22,900 --> 00:16:27,900]  It relates to slide 7 on Momo's Dumpling to the B2C market.\n",
            "[00:16:28,900 --> 00:16:33,900]  Could you give us your view on how sustainable you think that dominance is?\n",
            "[00:16:33,900 --> 00:16:36,900]  Presumably, those other companies, they're not doing so well.\n",
            "[00:16:36,900 --> 00:16:38,900]  They're trying to turn their performance around.\n",
            "[00:16:38,900 --> 00:16:41,900]  Is it feasible to take share from Momo?\n",
            "[00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:48,070]  Or do you believe it's more sustainable than that?\n",
            "[00:16:48,070 --> 00:16:55,070]  Well, I think like we communicated before, e-commerce has gotten to a point\n",
            "[00:16:56,070 --> 00:17:02,100]  where the competition is really in the warehouse build-out.\n",
            "[00:17:02,100 --> 00:17:12,580]  And right now, if you look at where Momo is, it's actually in a leading position\n",
            "[00:17:12,580 --> 00:17:17,620]  with a big gap compared to other players.\n",
            "[00:17:17,620 --> 00:17:24,620]  So, we see that in the short run, there's not going to be any possibility\n",
            "[00:17:24,620 --> 00:17:27,620]  for any other players to catch up to Momo.\n",
            "[00:17:27,620 --> 00:17:31,970]  Of course, in the mid to long run, a lot of things can happen.\n",
            "[00:17:31,970 --> 00:17:38,970]  But at least for the next 12 to 24 months, we don't see any threat to Momo's dominance.\n",
            "[00:17:38,970 --> 00:17:42,240]  Understood.\n",
            "[00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:43,240]  Thanks very much.\n",
            "[00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:44,660]  Sure.\n",
            "[00:17:44,660 --> 00:17:45,820]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:17:45,820 --> 00:17:46,820]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:17:46,820 --> 00:17:49,820]  Next question comes from Billy Lee with Credit Suisse in Hong Kong.\n",
            "[00:17:49,820 --> 00:17:51,940]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:17:51,940 --> 00:17:52,940]  Hello.\n",
            "[00:17:52,940 --> 00:17:56,940]  Thanks for the opportunity to ask a question.\n",
            "[00:17:56,940 --> 00:18:00,940]  I have a question for a question on 5G.\n",
            "[00:18:00,940 --> 00:18:05,940]  May I know what's the latest time based on your expectation\n",
            "[00:18:05,940 --> 00:18:08,940]  that when the spectrum will be auctioned?\n",
            "[00:18:08,940 --> 00:18:20,300]  And then when are you seeing commercialization of 5G?\n",
            "[00:18:20,300 --> 00:18:25,300]  To the best of our knowledge, right now the government is planning\n",
            "[00:18:25,300 --> 00:18:31,300]  on hosting the auction in December of this year.\n",
            "[00:18:31,300 --> 00:18:37,550]  Chances are it will be completed early next year.\n",
            "[00:18:37,550 --> 00:18:43,550]  Once it's completed, then some of the spectrums are trickier.\n",
            "[00:18:44,550 --> 00:18:53,260]  Say a telecom company wins the middle section of the spectrum,\n",
            "[00:18:53,260 --> 00:18:58,260]  which is the cleaner one, then they can immediately start building out.\n",
            "[00:18:58,260 --> 00:19:06,860]  It will probably take another six months-ish from there to the commercial launch.\n",
            "[00:19:06,860 --> 00:19:08,860]  Okay. I see.\n",
            "[00:19:08,860 --> 00:19:11,860]  Also, another follow-up question.\n",
            "[00:19:11,860 --> 00:19:16,860]  I know you earlier mentioned that it's confidential to mention about bidding strategy,\n",
            "[00:19:16,860 --> 00:19:23,860]  but any expectation on the landscape in terms of the competition\n",
            "[00:19:23,860 --> 00:19:25,860]  based on what you are feeling?\n",
            "[00:19:25,860 --> 00:19:36,800]  It's very hard to predict, but right now it looks like 5G,\n",
            "[00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:40,800]  the first wave of 5G deployment will be non-standalone,\n",
            "[00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:48,380]  which means that chances are it's the existing players.\n",
            "[00:19:48,380 --> 00:19:52,460]  Okay. Got it. Got it.\n",
            "[00:19:52,460 --> 00:19:55,460]  Another question, one more.\n",
            "[00:19:55,460 --> 00:20:02,450]  Do you have guidance for dividend payout for this year and probably next year?\n",
            "[00:20:02,450 --> 00:20:07,450]  Well, what we can say is we are always very committal to a stable dividend policy.\n",
            "[00:20:08,450 --> 00:20:16,450]  As to what the definition of stable means, it's up to the board to decide every April.\n",
            "[00:20:16,450 --> 00:20:28,030]  Okay. So it could mean absolutely or as percentage of earnings?\n",
            "[00:20:28,030 --> 00:20:34,960]  It's hard to tell. It's to be decided by the board every April.\n",
            "[00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:39,740]  Okay. Got it. Thank you.\n",
            "[00:20:39,740 --> 00:20:40,740]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:52,860]  Once again, ladies and gentlemen, there is no one here for questions.\n",
            "[00:20:52,860 --> 00:20:55,860]  Once again, ladies and gentlemen, there is no one here for questions.\n",
            "[00:20:55,860 --> 00:21:02,300]  And we have a follow-up question from Mr. Penelly. Please go ahead.\n",
            "[00:21:02,300 --> 00:21:10,260]  Yes, it's me again. Sorry. Another question on the telecom competition space.\n",
            "[00:21:10,260 --> 00:21:18,260]  So I know you mentioned the competition revenue and overall market has been stabilized.\n",
            "[00:21:19,260 --> 00:21:30,650]  On the ground, do you see, is it more like a really stabilized competition between the big three and the small three?\n",
            "[00:21:30,650 --> 00:21:33,650]  Or are the smaller guys becoming more aggressive?\n",
            "[00:21:33,650 --> 00:21:39,650]  And how are the other bigger three players responding to such a stabilized market?\n",
            "[00:21:39,650 --> 00:21:59,080]  Well, so as we presented in the slide, so the smaller players still have been competing pretty hard.\n",
            "[00:21:59,080 --> 00:22:04,110]  But we're seeing their strategies becoming less effective.\n",
            "[00:22:04,110 --> 00:22:10,110]  In terms of the big three, I think we're not seeing intensified competition.\n",
            "[00:22:10,110 --> 00:22:13,740]  Okay. Got it. Thank you.\n",
            "[00:22:13,740 --> 00:22:17,140]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:22:17,140 --> 00:22:32,720]  Once again, ladies and gentlemen, there is no one here for questions.\n",
            "[00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:35,720]  Once again, ladies and gentlemen, there is no one here for questions.\n",
            "[00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:50,820]  So if there's no more questions, we want to thank you for...\n",
            "[00:22:50,820 --> 00:22:53,820]  Sorry, Mr. Lin, we do have another follow-up question.\n",
            "[00:22:53,820 --> 00:22:54,820]  All right.\n",
            "[00:22:54,820 --> 00:22:58,180]  And also that is from Mr. Billy Lee. Please go ahead.\n",
            "[00:22:58,180 --> 00:23:01,180]  Yes. Sorry. Another question.\n",
            "[00:23:01,180 --> 00:23:10,180]  I saw the growth of the new businesses, IoT and cloud solutions, information security are doing pretty well.\n",
            "[00:23:10,180 --> 00:23:22,000]  Could you disclose what's the revenue amount there of these categories?\n",
            "[00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:28,860]  These are all below 10% single-digit percentage.\n",
            "[00:23:28,860 --> 00:23:30,860]  Of the total revenue?\n",
            "[00:23:30,860 --> 00:23:32,790]  Yes.\n",
            "[00:23:32,790 --> 00:23:34,910]  Okay. Thank you.\n",
            "[00:23:34,910 --> 00:23:46,050]  Thank you. Once again, ladies and gentlemen, there is no one here for questions.\n",
            "[00:23:46,050 --> 00:23:48,050]  And we have a follow-up question.\n",
            "[00:23:48,050 --> 00:23:51,050]  Another question comes from Ms. Amber Lee with Yuanda.\n",
            "[00:23:51,050 --> 00:23:52,050]  Please go ahead.\n",
            "[00:23:52,050 --> 00:23:56,100]  Hi. Just a question to follow up Billy's.\n",
            "[00:23:56,100 --> 00:24:05,100]  So on the 5G infrastructure investment, with you mentioned that the commercialization were coming in early next year,\n",
            "[00:24:05,100 --> 00:24:10,100]  when can we see the spike in investment amount?\n",
            "[00:24:10,100 --> 00:24:14,100]  Is it going to be next year or the year after?\n",
            "[00:24:14,100 --> 00:24:22,140]  You mean CapEx amount?\n",
            "[00:24:22,140 --> 00:24:29,140]  The CapEx for next year will be released in January or February next year.\n",
            "[00:24:29,140 --> 00:24:34,140]  We haven't completed our forecast for the next year.\n",
            "[00:24:34,140 --> 00:24:54,130]  Hi. This is Amber. Do you have any follow-up questions?\n",
            "[00:24:54,130 --> 00:24:56,250]  No. Thank you.\n",
            "[00:24:56,250 --> 00:24:59,500]  Thank you. One second, ladies and gentlemen.\n",
            "[00:24:59,500 --> 00:25:02,500]  To register for questions, please press star 1 on your telephone.\n",
            "[00:25:02,500 --> 00:25:03,500]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:25:03,500 --> 00:25:13,620]  And next, we have a follow-up question from Mr. Jiaxin with Sinopad.\n",
            "[00:25:13,620 --> 00:25:16,220]  Please go ahead.\n",
            "[00:25:16,220 --> 00:25:20,220]  Thank you. I have following questions.\n",
            "[00:25:20,220 --> 00:25:29,580]  The first question is I'm interested for the roaming.\n",
            "[00:25:29,580 --> 00:25:39,900]  The roaming business, we have cooperated with the tools model of our peers.\n",
            "[00:25:39,900 --> 00:25:50,380]  But it seems the NCC also agree the roaming plan for cooperation with Yatai.\n",
            "[00:25:51,380 --> 00:25:55,380]  So how do companies viewpoint for the roaming?\n",
            "[00:25:55,380 --> 00:26:00,380]  Especially for the roaming maybe in the 3G, 5G.\n",
            "[00:26:00,380 --> 00:26:06,380]  So what's our viewpoint in this kind of business?\n",
            "[00:26:06,380 --> 00:26:13,380]  How much of the profit we can generate from this kind of business?\n",
            "[00:26:13,380 --> 00:26:18,250]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:26:19,250 --> 00:26:32,280]  So in terms of roaming, since the revision of the Telecom Management Act,\n",
            "[00:26:32,280 --> 00:26:42,280]  the NCC has been supportive of this type of collaboration between telecom companies.\n",
            "[00:26:42,280 --> 00:26:48,950]  So we will continue to look for opportunities to grow this business.\n",
            "[00:26:48,950 --> 00:26:53,370]  In terms of profit, I'll let Rose chime in.\n",
            "[00:26:53,370 --> 00:27:01,370]  Well, I think the roaming agreement or roaming cooperation with smaller players\n",
            "[00:27:01,370 --> 00:27:05,370]  are just commercial negotiations.\n",
            "[00:27:05,370 --> 00:27:11,370]  So it's hard to predict the profit at this stage.\n",
            "[00:27:11,370 --> 00:27:19,370]  And also the agreement to be signed will be kept in strict confidence.\n",
            "[00:27:19,370 --> 00:27:25,260]  So I cannot share with you the profits of the roaming.\n",
            "[00:27:25,260 --> 00:27:26,260]  Okay.\n",
            "[00:27:27,260 --> 00:27:37,260]  So I'm interested for what kind of profit we can get from the fee or the service\n",
            "[00:27:37,260 --> 00:27:43,260]  or will we provide the services by roaming?\n",
            "[00:27:43,260 --> 00:27:48,260]  So I'm interested for the profit.\n",
            "[00:27:48,260 --> 00:27:52,260]  What kind of profit can be generated by the roaming business?\n",
            "[00:27:53,260 --> 00:28:04,260]  Only the roaming fee or we also can sell our services or our content by the roaming?\n",
            "[00:28:04,260 --> 00:28:05,610]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:28:05,610 --> 00:28:08,020]  Just the roaming charge.\n",
            "[00:28:08,020 --> 00:28:14,390]  Just the roaming charge. Okay. Thank you.\n",
            "[00:28:14,390 --> 00:28:38,100]  Thank you. One second, ladies and gentlemen. There is still one key for questions.\n",
            "[00:28:38,100 --> 00:28:42,260]  Excuse me, Mr. Lin. There seems to be no further questions at this point in time. Thank you.\n",
            "[00:28:42,260 --> 00:28:45,260]  All right. Thank you, everyone, for joining today's investors conference.\n",
            "[00:28:45,260 --> 00:28:47,260]  You all have a good evening.\n",

            "[00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,000]  Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to the conference call. Our chairperson today is Mr. Jamie Lin. Mr. Lin, please be on conference. Thank you.\n",

            "[00:01:17,020 --> 00:01:22,020]  So for business overview, I would like to start with the operating performance of our telecom business.\n",
            "[00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:26,250]  Please turn to the increase in free cash flow page.\n",
            "[00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:34,250]  Despite clear challenges we face in today's telecom market, Taiwan Mobile has delivered solid results via rigorous cost control,\n",
            "[00:01:34,250 --> 00:01:38,250]  quick-to-market unique offerings, and successful diversification.\n",
            "[00:01:38,250 --> 00:01:46,250]  I will go through them in more detail in the next few slides, but let's start with some key numbers for our telecom business.\n",
            "[00:01:46,250 --> 00:01:50,600]  Even with the adoption of IFRS 15 last year and IFRS 16 this year,\n",
            "[00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:59,600]  we believe the pre-IFRS telecom service revenue and EBITDA better reflect our operating results and cash generation capabilities,\n",
            "[00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:02,600]  so we're listing them here for your information.\n",
            "[00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:09,600]  In 1Q19, our pre-IFRS telecom service revenue declined by 11% year-over-year,\n",
            "[00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:15,600]  mainly due to the high base in 1Q18 prior to the 499 frenzy.\n",
            "[00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:22,630]  When that started in May last year, pre-IFRS EBITDA also showed similar trends.\n",
            "[00:02:22,630 --> 00:02:29,630]  In spite of the worldwide decline in pre-IFRS operating cash flow, with prudent capex management,\n",
            "[00:02:29,630 --> 00:02:38,500]  we further increased our free cash flow to $5.5 billion NT dollars for the quarter.\n",
            "[00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:41,500]  Next, I want to cover versatility.\n",
            "[00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:51,500]  To cope with a more challenging operating environment, we have taken various measures to reduce costs while finding new growth avenues.\n",
            "[00:02:51,500 --> 00:03:02,980]  In the first quarter, we reduced reliance on third-party by increasing mobile sign-ups via our own channel by 7% worldwide.\n",
            "[00:03:02,980 --> 00:03:08,330]  Our own channels include physical stores, telemarketing, and online stores.\n",
            "[00:03:08,330 --> 00:03:15,330]  We will continue to offer more non-handset bundle options to differentiate from our peers.\n",
            "[00:03:15,330 --> 00:03:26,390]  Our effort results in two percentage points decrease in subscriber acquisition costs as a percentage of our pool versus a year ago.\n",
            "[00:03:26,390 --> 00:03:31,680]  And the post-paid churn rate also fell to a record low of 1.2%.\n",
            "[00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:41,940]  As to new growth avenues, demand for IoT connectivity remains strong with 26% year-over-year growth seen in 1Q.\n",
            "[00:03:41,940 --> 00:03:52,940]  Other enterprise segments such as ICT, cloud, and internet and data access also saw combined revenue rising by 5% year-over-year.\n",
            "[00:03:52,940 --> 00:03:56,540]  Now let's turn to diversification page.\n",
            "[00:03:56,540 --> 00:04:02,540]  This summarizes the progress we've made with our diversification strategy.\n",
            "[00:04:02,540 --> 00:04:07,580]  While our telecom business suffers a worldwide decline in operating income,\n",
            "[00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:20,770]  the combined operating income of cable, TV, and mobile already accounted for 20% of total operating income in 1Q90 up from 19% a year ago.\n",
            "[00:04:20,770 --> 00:04:28,770]  In spite of the revenue pressure on basic TV subscription, we are seeing resilience in our paid TV business\n",
            "[00:04:28,770 --> 00:04:37,990]  thanks to positive factors such as cross-selling to fixed broadband and digital TV as well as falling depreciation.\n",
            "[00:04:37,990 --> 00:04:41,990]  As for mobile, being the largest B2C player in the market,\n",
            "[00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:49,990]  we expect the upward trend to continue for years given the low e-commerce penetration rate in Taiwan's retail market.\n",
            "[00:04:49,990 --> 00:05:00,410]  While the fast-growing low-margin 3C electronic sales underpins the top-line momentum for its B2C business,\n",
            "[00:05:00,410 --> 00:05:09,410]  margins have improved worldwide thanks to better pricing strategy, economies of scale, and operating leverage.\n",
            "[00:05:09,410 --> 00:05:15,270]  Now let's dig a little bit deeper into Momo, our crown jewel's performance.\n",
            "[00:05:15,270 --> 00:05:25,820]  In 1Q90, Momo's total revenue grew by 15% year-over-year on the back of strong momentum from B2C e-commerce division,\n",
            "[00:05:25,820 --> 00:05:33,820]  where average ticket size grew by 5% yoy and number of transactions grew by 14% yoy.\n",
            "[00:05:33,820 --> 00:05:39,820]  The total EBITDA also grew by 17% on a pre-IFRS 16 basis\n",
            "[00:05:39,820 --> 00:05:44,360]  thanks to scale benefits and operating leverage.\n",
            "[00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:48,360]  Now let me turn the presentation over to our CFO, Rosie, for financial overview.\n",
            "[00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:56,130]  Hi, good afternoon. This is Rosie. Let's turn to the performance by business page.\n",
            "[00:05:56,130 --> 00:06:01,130]  In the first quarter, our consolidated revenue declined by only 1% year-on-year\n",
            "[00:06:01,130 --> 00:06:07,540]  as Momo's strong revenue growth largely offset the decline in telecom business.\n",
            "[00:06:07,540 --> 00:06:12,540]  With increasing same-only portion in our subscriber base,\n",
            "[00:06:12,540 --> 00:06:21,540]  the operating expense savings and Momo's strength did not compensate for the accumulated impact on revenue,\n",
            "[00:06:21,540 --> 00:06:28,090]  resulting in a 9% decline in pre-IFRS 16 EBITDA.\n",
            "[00:06:28,090 --> 00:06:35,090]  On the reported basis, EBITDA grew by 3% due to the adoption of IFRS 16,\n",
            "[00:06:35,090 --> 00:06:38,090]  which requires the capitalization of operating leases,\n",
            "[00:06:38,090 --> 00:06:44,090]  resulting in lower operating costs but higher CNA and interest expense.\n",
            "[00:06:44,090 --> 00:06:48,080]  Let's move to the results summary page.\n",
            "[00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:56,220]  The combined operating income of Cable TV and Momo grew by 9% yoy,\n",
            "[00:06:56,220 --> 00:07:04,320]  helping mitigate the yoy decline in telecom operating income in the first quarter of 2019.\n",
            "[00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:10,610]  Overall, operating income for all major businesses exceeded their guidance\n",
            "[00:07:10,610 --> 00:07:16,610]  thanks to the effective cost control and economies of scale in e-commerce business.\n",
            "[00:07:16,610 --> 00:07:23,410]  Please refer to our IR website conference section for more detailed analysis.\n",
            "[00:07:23,410 --> 00:07:27,530]  Now let's turn to the balance sheet analysis.\n",
            "[00:07:27,530 --> 00:07:36,650]  On the asset front, the year-on-year decrease in current asset was driven by lower receivables and contract assets.\n",
            "[00:07:36,650 --> 00:07:40,680]  As a result of rising appetite for same-only plans.\n",
            "[00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:48,100]  For non-current assets, property and equipment and concessions fell significantly year-on-year\n",
            "[00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:52,260]  as a result of the termination of 3G services,\n",
            "[00:07:52,260 --> 00:07:58,260]  while the inclusion of right-of-use assets in accordance with IFRS 16\n",
            "[00:07:58,260 --> 00:08:03,260]  resulted in the slight increase in overall non-current assets.\n",
            "[00:08:03,260 --> 00:08:11,500]  On the liability front, our growth debt decreased nicely year-on-year\n",
            "[00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:15,660]  as we paid down debt with healthy free cash flow.\n",
            "[00:08:15,660 --> 00:08:20,660]  However, our total liabilities remained flat year-on-year\n",
            "[00:08:20,660 --> 00:08:25,660]  due to the inclusion of lease liabilities in accordance with IFRS 16.\n",
            "[00:08:25,660 --> 00:08:32,660]  This balances out the impact from the inclusion of the right-of-use assets\n",
            "[00:08:32,660 --> 00:08:35,660]  we mentioned earlier on non-current assets.\n",
            "[00:08:35,660 --> 00:08:44,140]  In terms of financial ratios, our net debt to pre-IFRS 16 EBITDA improved to 1.3 times.\n",
            "[00:08:44,140 --> 00:08:50,140]  And our current ratio also rose to 73% versus 60% a year ago.\n",
            "[00:08:50,140 --> 00:08:55,330]  Now let's turn to cash flow analysis.\n",
            "[00:08:55,330 --> 00:09:03,450]  Our operating cash inflow increased quarter-on-quarter and year-on-year in the first quarter.\n",
            "[00:09:04,450 --> 00:09:08,450]  This is because of the adoption of IFRS 16.\n",
            "[00:09:08,450 --> 00:09:13,450]  Leasing expenses previously had been under operating activities\n",
            "[00:09:13,450 --> 00:09:19,450]  and were reclassified into repayment of principal and interest of lease liabilities\n",
            "[00:09:19,450 --> 00:09:22,930]  under the financing activities.\n",
            "[00:09:22,930 --> 00:09:29,020]  On a pre-IFRS 16 basis, operating cash inflow declined year-on-year\n",
            "[00:09:29,020 --> 00:09:37,600]  mainly due to MOMO's money market fund redemption in the first quarter of 2018.\n",
            "[00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:42,850]  As for investing cash flow,\n",
            "[00:09:42,850 --> 00:09:47,850]  the outflow in the first quarter was lower than a year ago due to lower capex.\n",
            "[00:09:47,850 --> 00:09:51,710]  In terms of financing activities,\n",
            "[00:09:51,710 --> 00:09:59,510]  the net cash outflow was mainly caused by debt repayment on the back of healthy free cash flow.\n",
            "[00:09:59,510 --> 00:10:02,510]  With capex falling by 27% year-on-year,\n",
            "[00:10:02,510 --> 00:10:12,510]  free cash flow calculated based on pre-IFRS 16 basis reached $5.45 billion,\n",
            "[00:10:12,510 --> 00:10:20,930]  up 5% year-on-year, translating into a free cash flow yield of 7.2%.\n",
            "[00:10:20,930 --> 00:10:27,660]  Let me turn the presentation back over to Jamie for event updates and key messages.\n",
            "[00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:30,660]  Turning to the event updates page,\n",
            "[00:10:30,660 --> 00:10:36,660]  the board has proposed dividend per share of 5.6 NT dollars today.\n",
            "[00:10:36,660 --> 00:10:42,700]  Pending AGM approval, this will mark the sixth consecutive year of paying this dollar amount\n",
            "[00:10:42,700 --> 00:10:46,730]  and implies 113% payout ratio.\n",
            "[00:10:46,730 --> 00:10:54,210]  Also listed here are the recognitions we received in the first quarter of 2019 for your reference.\n",
            "[00:10:54,210 --> 00:10:56,210]  Finally, to wrap up our presentation,\n",
            "[00:10:56,210 --> 00:11:01,240]  this slide summarizes the key messages that we would like to deliver.\n",

            "[00:12:25,690 --> 00:12:28,690]  Could you elaborate a little bit more on that?\n",
            "[00:12:28,690 --> 00:12:33,720]  What particular areas you're looking to expand in?\n",
            "[00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:34,720]  What type of product?\n",
            "[00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:36,720]  And if you can, which particular markets?\n",

            "[00:12:42,740 --> 00:12:49,740]  So let's take our subsidiary MOMO as an example, right?\n",
            "[00:12:49,740 --> 00:12:54,740]  So MOMO is the number one e-commerce player, B2C e-commerce player in Taiwan.\n",
            "[00:12:54,740 --> 00:12:56,740]  Now that they are very successful,\n",
            "[00:12:56,740 --> 00:13:04,340]  they have embarked on expanding their business model across Southeast Asia.\n",
            "[00:13:04,340 --> 00:13:09,340]  Their first stop is Thailand, where they are having pretty good initial success,\n",
            "[00:13:09,340 --> 00:13:14,340]  both on the TV shopping and online B2C shopping.\n",
            "[00:13:14,340 --> 00:13:19,340]  And next up, they will look to replicate this model\n",
            "[00:13:19,340 --> 00:13:26,380]  and this go-to-market strategy across other countries in Southeast Asia.\n",
            "[00:13:26,380 --> 00:13:35,380]  So I think MOMO's initial success in expanding their business model into the region\n",
            "[00:13:35,380 --> 00:13:48,210]  would be an example of our group's future sort of expansion strategies across the region.\n",
            "[00:13:48,210 --> 00:13:54,210]  So going forward, you can expect us to bring our online services\n",
            "[00:13:54,210 --> 00:14:05,820]  and non-telecom products and expand those offerings across Southeast Asia countries.\n",
            "[00:14:05,820 --> 00:14:09,860]  Okay, thank you.\n",
            "[00:14:09,860 --> 00:14:15,860]  So it's primarily MOMO, is it, as opposed to ‚Äì you mentioned the other apps and services.\n",
            "[00:14:16,860 --> 00:14:21,270]  But say, on the enterprise side, for instance,\n",
            "[00:14:21,270 --> 00:14:24,270]  I think Changhua has talked more about going overseas there.\n",
            "[00:14:24,270 --> 00:14:30,990]  Is that also a focus for Tama Mobile, or is it more consumer?\n",
            "[00:14:30,990 --> 00:14:34,990]  Well, I'm only using MOMO as an example.\n",
            "[00:14:34,990 --> 00:14:39,990]  So that is sort of a case study of our online services\n",
            "[00:14:39,990 --> 00:14:43,990]  and OTT business models expanding outside of Taiwan.\n",
            "[00:14:43,990 --> 00:14:53,990]  And going forward, we're expecting many more of our online services\n",
            "[00:14:53,990 --> 00:14:57,990]  and business models that we've built here in Taiwan\n",
            "[00:14:57,990 --> 00:15:03,990]  that would get to a place where we feel that it's competitive across the region,\n",
            "[00:15:03,990 --> 00:15:09,990]  and we will work on bringing them into the rest of greater Southeast Asia\n",
            "[00:15:09,990 --> 00:15:13,790]  and help them become regional champions.\n",
            "[00:15:13,790 --> 00:15:14,790]  Understood. Okay.\n",
            "[00:15:14,790 --> 00:15:17,790]  And the cost of that overseas expansion,\n",
            "[00:15:17,790 --> 00:15:23,790]  is that reflected in the current CAPEX and the current four-year guidance?\n",
            "[00:15:23,790 --> 00:15:28,060]  No.\n",
            "[00:15:28,060 --> 00:15:33,950]  It's not? So there will be additional costs on top of that?\n",
            "[00:15:33,950 --> 00:15:41,950]  Yeah, because we have to evaluate the opportunities and also the strategies first.\n",
            "[00:15:41,950 --> 00:15:47,280]  So it's not yet included.\n",
            "[00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:49,280]  Okay. Thanks, Rosie. Thank you.\n",
            "[00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:55,590]  Thank you. Once again, please press star 1 for questions. Thank you.\n",

            "[00:16:05,660 --> 00:16:18,950]  Next question is from Gary Yu with Morgan Stanley. Thank you.\n",
            "[00:16:18,950 --> 00:16:22,300]  Hi. Thank you for the opportunity to ask questions.\n",
            "[00:16:22,300 --> 00:16:25,300]  I just have one question regarding 5G.\n",
            "[00:16:25,300 --> 00:16:29,300]  What kind of timetable do we expect in terms of spectrum auction,\n",
            "[00:16:29,300 --> 00:16:32,300]  service launch in Taiwan?\n",
            "[00:16:33,300 --> 00:16:40,460]  And then a related question is that is there any potential revenue opportunities\n",
            "[00:16:40,460 --> 00:16:46,990]  that we are particularly more interested in when 5G comes?\n",
            "[00:16:46,990 --> 00:16:50,990]  So right now, based on the best of our knowledge,\n",
            "[00:16:51,990 --> 00:17:05,090]  the administration is working towards having the bidding start towards the end of the year.\n",
            "[00:17:05,090 --> 00:17:15,380]  And hopefully their plan is to maybe have the auction concluded by the early of next year.\n",
            "[00:17:15,380 --> 00:17:21,380]  So after that, if we are successful in winning the auction bid,\n",
            "[00:17:21,380 --> 00:17:28,380]  then it will be up to us to start building the 5G network and business model.\n",
            "[00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:38,540]  Right now, the businesses that we're mostly interested are vertical type of business models\n",
            "[00:17:39,540 --> 00:17:49,540]  industries such as manufacturing, medical, transportation, and or retail\n",
            "[00:17:49,540 --> 00:18:01,540]  to bring vertically integrated 5G type of solutions to the end customers and end users.\n",
            "[00:18:01,540 --> 00:18:05,420]  Hope that answers your question, Gary.\n",

            "[00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:40,480]  There's no further questions at this point in time.\n",
            "[00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:41,480]  Sorry.\n",
            "[00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:45,480]  We have one question from Amber Lee with Yanta Securities.\n",
            "[00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:46,480]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:48,340]  Hi.\n",
            "[00:18:48,340 --> 00:18:51,340]  I have one question on your EBIT contribution.\n",
            "[00:18:51,340 --> 00:18:57,340]  Looks like in the first quarter, Cable TV and Momo contributed 23% of total EBIT.\n",
            "[00:18:58,340 --> 00:19:06,340]  I know in the last quarter, you have guided a 21% of full-year EBIT contribution from the two segments.\n",
            "[00:19:06,340 --> 00:19:11,340]  It now appears that telecom business has been weaker than expected\n",
            "[00:19:11,340 --> 00:19:14,340]  while Cable TV and Momo has been stronger.\n",
            "[00:19:14,340 --> 00:19:19,380]  So I'll say you're upside to those numbers, the 21% contribution.\n",
            "[00:19:19,380 --> 00:19:23,260]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:19:23,260 --> 00:19:28,260]  Well, you know, Momo's actually performed better than expected.\n",
            "[00:19:28,260 --> 00:19:30,420]  I believe you've noticed.\n",
            "[00:19:30,420 --> 00:19:46,520]  They have improved all of their margins from gross margin to EBITDA margin to EBIT down to after-tax.\n",
            "[00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:57,570]  So that's the situation that we've observed for their first quarter results.\n",
            "[00:19:58,570 --> 00:20:04,860]  So the first quarter, based on the first quarter results,\n",
            "[00:20:04,860 --> 00:20:15,560]  I think we have no need to revise our forecast for the whole year.\n",
            "[00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:24,060]  But I believe Momo will still outperform their target.\n",
            "[00:20:24,060 --> 00:20:30,060]  I just want to add that we actually beat our EBIT estimate by 8%.\n",
            "[00:20:30,060 --> 00:20:35,060]  So our telecom business is actually stronger than expected, not weaker than expected.\n",
            "[00:20:35,060 --> 00:20:40,060]  It's Momo that is doing better, much better than expected.\n",
            "[00:20:40,060 --> 00:20:45,300]  Thank you.\n",

            "[00:00:57,390 --> 00:01:01,390]  Let's turn to the first page, business overview.\n",
            "[00:01:01,390 --> 00:01:06,740]  In the next three slides, I would like to highlight our growth areas.\n",
            "[00:01:06,740 --> 00:01:12,350]  First, on the mobile business, on a life-on-life basis,\n",
            "[00:01:12,350 --> 00:01:21,510]  Taiwan Mobile's mobile service revenue in the third quarter was up by NT$1.04 billion,\n",
            "[00:01:21,510 --> 00:01:25,510]  or 7% worldwide, the highest among the big three.\n",
            "[00:01:25,510 --> 00:01:33,510]  This is credit to a healthy growth momentum in mobile data and contained decline in voice revenue.\n",
            "[00:01:33,510 --> 00:01:35,990]  Please turn to the second page.\n",
            "[00:01:35,990 --> 00:01:42,990]  Regarding our smartphone strategy, apart from the 21 exclusive smartphone models we currently have,\n",
            "[00:01:42,990 --> 00:01:47,990]  we also have around 54 smartphone and tablet products on the market.\n",
            "[00:01:47,990 --> 00:01:52,990]  In the third quarter, smartphone sales volume was up 50% from a year ago\n",
            "[00:01:52,990 --> 00:01:55,990]  and accounted for 91% of total handsets sold.\n",
            "[00:01:55,990 --> 00:02:03,990]  Therefore, mobile data adoption rate went up to 51% of the post-base install base from 37% a year ago.\n",
            "[00:02:03,990 --> 00:02:08,990]  This led to a 40% worldwide growth in mobile data revenue in the third quarter.\n",
            "[00:02:08,990 --> 00:02:11,990]  Please turn to the third page.\n",
            "[00:02:11,990 --> 00:02:16,990]  As indicated in the table, our internet subscriber base increased of 7%\n",
            "[00:02:17,990 --> 00:02:26,990]  and DTV customer base growth of 62% were both higher than the 1% subscriber rise in LTV service in third quarter,\n",
            "[00:02:26,990 --> 00:02:34,980]  representing the trend of an expanding penetration rate in both DTV and cable internet business.\n",
            "[00:02:34,980 --> 00:02:36,980]  Let's turn to the next page.\n",
            "[00:02:36,980 --> 00:02:42,980]  This page of new products and services we recently launched is for your reference.\n",
            "[00:02:42,980 --> 00:02:45,980]  Let's turn to our financial overview.\n",
            "[00:02:45,980 --> 00:02:54,140]  In third quarter, we reported total revenue of NT$27.3 billion,\n",
            "[00:02:54,140 --> 00:03:00,140]  EBITDA of NT$8 billion, and EPS of NT$1.58.\n",
            "[00:03:00,140 --> 00:03:10,360]  In third quarter, our telecom service revenues showed a 2% worldwide increase versus a sluggish telecom cash cost.\n",
            "[00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:13,460]  Therefore, telecom service profit increased.\n",
            "[00:03:14,740 --> 00:03:18,740]  Third quarter handset subsidies only edged out slightly worldwide.\n",
            "[00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:27,020]  The OPEX increase was due to adding 83 more company stores from a year ago.\n",
            "[00:03:27,020 --> 00:03:33,020]  In the EBITDA side, as CBG, EBG, HBG, and MOMO all had healthy revenue growth,\n",
            "[00:03:33,020 --> 00:03:38,020]  this led to a 3% worldwide increase in EBITDA in the quarter,\n",
            "[00:03:38,020 --> 00:03:42,020]  growing from a 2% EBITDA increase in second quarter.\n",
            "[00:03:42,020 --> 00:03:48,570]  For the first three quarters, our accumulated EBITDA and net profits were both ahead of guidance,\n",
            "[00:03:48,570 --> 00:03:54,570]  benefiting from higher-than-expected telecom service revenue and contained handset subsidies.\n",
            "[00:03:54,570 --> 00:03:57,560]  Please turn to the next page.\n",
            "[00:03:57,560 --> 00:04:03,560]  CBG's third quarter top line grows more than offset expense increases\n",
            "[00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:07,560]  related to 3G base station increases and new store openings.\n",
            "[00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:12,560]  This helped CBG's EBITDA to grow 2% worldwide in third quarter,\n",
            "[00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:16,560]  growing from a 1% EBITDA rise in second quarter.\n",
            "[00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:22,590]  EBG's third quarter EBITDA worldwide growth largely resulted from mobile business growth,\n",
            "[00:04:22,590 --> 00:04:25,590]  coupled with stable costs and expenses.\n",
            "[00:04:25,590 --> 00:04:30,590]  HBG's third quarter EBITDA continuously maintained stable.\n",
            "[00:04:30,590 --> 00:04:35,620]  In addition to MOMO scaling down its cosmetic store operations,\n",
            "[00:04:35,620 --> 00:04:38,620]  it sold its department store at the end of August.\n",
            "[00:04:38,620 --> 00:04:42,620]  As a result, MOMO's EBITDA was up 10% worldwide,\n",
            "[00:04:42,620 --> 00:04:45,620]  affected by a narrowing margin in the virtual channel business.\n",
            "[00:04:45,620 --> 00:04:51,620]  MOMO's EBITDA for the third quarter decreased from a quarter ago.\n",
            "[00:04:51,620 --> 00:04:57,780]  Let me turn the presentation over to Rosie for balance sheet and cash flow analysis.\n",
            "[00:04:57,780 --> 00:05:02,650]  Good afternoon. Let's look at the balance sheet.\n",
            "[00:05:03,650 --> 00:05:07,650]  On the asset side, the year-on-year increase in accounts receivable\n",
            "[00:05:07,650 --> 00:05:13,650]  mainly reflected the expanded bundled handset sales and mobile service revenue.\n",
            "[00:05:13,650 --> 00:05:17,650]  The quarter-on-quarter and year-on-year increases in long-term investment\n",
            "[00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:22,940]  were largely a reflection of the rising investment in Taipei New Horizons.\n",
            "[00:05:22,940 --> 00:05:25,940]  On the liabilities and shareholders' equity,\n",
            "[00:05:25,940 --> 00:05:30,940]  an NT$7.96 billion increase in short-term debt in the quarter\n",
            "[00:05:30,940 --> 00:05:38,940]  raised our net debt balance to NT$19.7 billion, or 65% annual EBITDA.\n",
            "[00:05:38,940 --> 00:05:45,160]  Other current liabilities dropped after NT$14.8 billion of cash dividend\n",
            "[00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:48,380]  was paid in the third quarter.\n",
            "[00:05:48,380 --> 00:05:55,380]  The current ratio at the end of the third quarter was higher than a quarter ago\n",
            "[00:05:55,380 --> 00:06:01,380]  because of lower other current liabilities following our payment of dividends.\n",
            "[00:06:01,380 --> 00:06:05,380]  ROE remained at 32%.\n",
            "[00:06:05,380 --> 00:06:10,760]  Let's turn to the next page for cash flow analysis.\n",
            "[00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:17,790]  In third quarter of this year, operating cash inflow decreased substantially\n",
            "[00:06:17,790 --> 00:06:21,790]  due to drops in accounts payable and other payables.\n",
            "[00:06:21,790 --> 00:06:24,790]  Net investing cash outflow in the quarter\n",
            "[00:06:24,790 --> 00:06:30,790]  was mainly for the NT$2.67 billion in cash capex\n",
            "[00:06:30,790 --> 00:06:39,790]  and NT$0.3 billion capital call from our 49.9% held Taipei New Horizons.\n",
            "[00:06:39,790 --> 00:06:45,850]  The third quarter investing cash outflow decreased from a quarter ago\n",
            "[00:06:45,850 --> 00:06:49,850]  due to proceeds collected from the sale of the money market funds\n",
            "[00:06:49,850 --> 00:06:53,850]  and department store operations as well as dividend income.\n",
            "[00:06:53,850 --> 00:07:00,070]  Demand financing cash outflow for the third quarter was the payment of cash dividends.\n",
            "[00:07:00,070 --> 00:07:05,070]  Third quarter financing cash outflow increased from a year ago\n",
            "[00:07:05,070 --> 00:07:10,070]  due to lesser short-term borrowings made and higher cash dividends paid.\n",
            "[00:07:10,070 --> 00:07:19,000]  Capex in the first three quarters totaled NT$9.31 billion, up from NT$5.95 billion a year ago.\n",
            "[00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:29,000]  This was largely due to the delayed payment into first quarter this year of the new IDC.\n",
            "[00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:34,990]  Construction completed last year.\n",
            "[00:07:34,990 --> 00:07:39,990]  In addition, mobile capex was up by NT$1 billion from a year ago\n",
            "[00:07:39,990 --> 00:07:44,990]  while the remaining increase came from securing more set-up boxes.\n",
            "[00:07:46,660 --> 00:07:51,820]  Let me turn the presentation back to Cliff for event updates and key messages.\n",
            "[00:07:51,820 --> 00:07:55,300]  Okay, let's turn to the event updates.\n",
            "[00:07:55,300 --> 00:08:00,340]  In today's board meeting, there is a resolution.\n",
            "[00:08:00,340 --> 00:08:05,340]  On October 31st, the board approved NT$29 billion spending\n",
            "[00:08:05,340 --> 00:08:10,340]  to acquire A4 and C1 blocks in the mobile broadband spectrum auction\n",
            "[00:08:10,340 --> 00:08:17,340]  and additional NT$0.66 billion capital expenditure in 2013\n",
            "[00:08:17,340 --> 00:08:20,340]  to accelerate mobile data network deployment.\n",
            "[00:08:20,340 --> 00:08:26,340]  The group's capex budget will be raised to around NT$13.5 billion\n",
            "[00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:31,340]  with extra cash payments subject to the time of acceptance on deployment.\n",
            "[00:08:31,340 --> 00:08:38,680]  This lower part of the slide lists the awards we have recently received for your reference.\n",
            "[00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:44,100]  Let's turn to the next page regarding our key messages.\n",
            "[00:08:44,100 --> 00:08:49,510]  To wrap up our presentation, these slides summarize the key messages\n",
            "[00:08:49,510 --> 00:08:51,540]  that we would like to deliver.\n",
            "[00:08:51,540 --> 00:08:56,540]  With an aim to better position the company in accordance\n",
            "[00:08:56,540 --> 00:08:59,540]  with our latest marketing network deployment plans,\n",
            "[00:08:59,540 --> 00:09:07,540]  TWM has resolved to increase expenditure resulting in higher than forecasted expenses\n",
            "[00:09:07,540 --> 00:09:09,540]  in the fourth quarter.\n",
            "[00:09:09,540 --> 00:09:14,980]  That says we are confident in achieving our annual EPS target.\n",
            "[00:09:14,980 --> 00:09:19,980]  Second, having won two out of the three most valuable 50 MHz blocks,\n",
            "[00:09:19,980 --> 00:09:27,980]  TWM is confident in launching 4G services in both the 1800 and 700 MHz bands\n",
            "[00:09:27,980 --> 00:09:33,980]  in the most cost-efficient manner, setting the stage for superb 4G services.\n",
            "[00:09:33,980 --> 00:09:37,970]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:09:37,970 --> 00:09:44,430]  Now we open the floor for questions and answers.\n",
            "[00:09:44,430 --> 00:09:47,430]  Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, we will now open for questions.\n",
            "[00:09:47,430 --> 00:09:51,430]  If you would like to register for a question, please press star 1 key now. Thank you.\n",
            "[00:09:51,430 --> 00:10:11,610]  Any questions?\n",
            "[00:10:11,610 --> 00:10:14,610]  Once again, ladies and gentlemen, if you would like to register for a question,\n",
            "[00:10:14,610 --> 00:10:16,610]  please press star 1 key now.\n",
            "[00:10:16,610 --> 00:11:00,580]  Our first question comes from Ms. Lucy Liu with J.P. Morgan Hong Kong. Thank you.\n",
            "[00:11:00,580 --> 00:11:04,580]  Hi, thank you. I have a few questions.\n",
            "[00:11:04,580 --> 00:11:11,580]  One is it's good to see that your voice revenue declines lower than your peers,\n",
            "[00:11:11,580 --> 00:11:14,580]  but I just wonder what's the reason behind it\n",
            "[00:11:14,580 --> 00:11:18,580]  and what kind of a trend are we expecting in going forward?\n",
            "[00:11:18,580 --> 00:11:23,580]  And then secondly, it's on the CAPEX and the OPEX kind of guidance.\n",
            "[00:11:23,580 --> 00:11:28,580]  So I just wonder why do we want to raise the CAPEX budget this year?\n",
            "[00:11:29,580 --> 00:11:36,580]  And also you mentioned that in fourth quarter, there will be some increasing costs.\n",
            "[00:11:36,580 --> 00:11:42,580]  What exactly are those cost items to be increased? Is that iPhone related?\n",
            "[00:11:42,580 --> 00:11:45,580]  And my last question is also on 4G.\n",
            "[00:11:45,580 --> 00:11:50,580]  So what kind of network employment progress are you expecting,\n",
            "[00:11:50,580 --> 00:11:55,580]  given that C1 you probably need to swap with 5T.\n",
            "[00:11:55,580 --> 00:12:03,580]  And A4 still is in 700 Mbps, which the value chain is relatively less immature.\n",
            "[00:12:03,580 --> 00:12:07,580]  So just to wonder your general strategy with 4G. Thank you.\n",
            "[00:12:07,580 --> 00:12:16,510]  Regarding the first issue, the reason we can contain the decline of our voice revenue\n",
            "[00:12:16,510 --> 00:12:23,510]  is that we focus on acquiring high-quality subscribers with real needs for voice service.\n",
            "[00:12:23,510 --> 00:12:29,510]  So actually our acquisition number may not be higher than our competitors,\n",
            "[00:12:29,510 --> 00:12:36,510]  but the Apple contribution and the voice contribution from our acquisition actually is pretty good.\n",
            "[00:12:36,510 --> 00:12:40,510]  That's the reason we can contain the voice decline.\n",
            "[00:12:40,510 --> 00:12:46,510]  The second issue regarding the CAPEX raised in the fourth quarter\n",
            "[00:12:46,510 --> 00:12:52,510]  is that even though we are planning to launch the LTE service in 2014,\n",
            "[00:12:52,510 --> 00:13:02,510]  but as you know, initially the 4G LTE cannot provide the voice service.\n",
            "[00:13:02,510 --> 00:13:07,510]  So you really need to have a 3G network to fall back,\n",
            "[00:13:07,510 --> 00:13:16,540]  so that it is necessary for us to continue to construct our 3G network\n",
            "[00:13:16,540 --> 00:13:29,540]  in order to provide the capacity for data increase and also the 4G fallback to 3G voice service.\n",
            "[00:13:29,540 --> 00:13:32,220]  The third issue is the cost.\n",
            "[00:13:32,220 --> 00:13:41,220]  The cost increase really has something to do with the handset sales.\n",
            "[00:13:42,220 --> 00:13:49,220]  The bundle handset sales this year is higher than we had originally budgeted.\n",
            "[00:13:49,220 --> 00:13:55,220]  So we have to increase the cost and expenses related to handset subsidies.\n",
            "[00:13:55,220 --> 00:14:02,250]  But this wouldn't affect our EPS or affect the total financial performance.\n",
            "[00:14:02,250 --> 00:14:13,240]  As for the 4G deployment, even though the C1 is currently occupied by FET,\n",
            "[00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:21,240]  but as you know, FET also has the C4 which is occupied by TWM.\n",
            "[00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:28,240]  I think we will go through a business negotiation and hopefully with the help of the NCC\n",
            "[00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:40,530]  try to reach a satisfactory resolution so that both sides can have 1,800 LTE networks launched by 2014.\n",
            "[00:14:40,530 --> 00:14:51,530]  So our deployment plan is due to have 1,800 and the 700 so that by the time in 2014,\n",
            "[00:14:51,530 --> 00:15:00,350]  hopefully we will have both 1,800 and 700 networks to provide for 4G consumers.\n",
            "[00:15:00,350 --> 00:15:02,350]  Okay, thank you very much.\n",
            "[00:15:02,350 --> 00:15:03,900]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:15:03,900 --> 00:15:06,900]  Our next question comes from Vicky Lin with Merlin Hong Kong.\n",
            "[00:15:06,900 --> 00:15:07,900]  Please go ahead.\n",
            "[00:15:07,900 --> 00:15:11,950]  Sorry, our question has already been asked.\n",
            "[00:15:11,950 --> 00:15:12,950]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:15:12,950 --> 00:15:14,050]  Okay, thank you.\n",
            "[00:15:14,050 --> 00:15:17,050]  Our next question comes from Jay Tabang with Credit Suisse Hong Kong.\n",
            "[00:15:17,050 --> 00:15:18,050]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:15:18,050 --> 00:15:20,270]  Hi, good afternoon everyone.\n",
            "[00:15:20,270 --> 00:15:22,270]  Congratulations on the 4G auction result.\n",
            "[00:15:22,270 --> 00:15:24,270]  I have four questions.\n",
            "[00:15:24,270 --> 00:15:26,270]  The first question is related to the CAPEX.\n",
            "[00:15:26,270 --> 00:15:31,270]  Now in light of the launch of 4G services in 2014,\n",
            "[00:15:31,270 --> 00:15:36,270]  is there any early guidance we could look at in terms of the CAPEX for 2014?\n",
            "[00:15:36,270 --> 00:15:42,300]  Should we not expect it to be lower than 2013 or how should I look at it?\n",
            "[00:15:42,300 --> 00:15:51,300]  The second is regarding the financing of the spectrum fee.\n",
            "[00:15:51,300 --> 00:15:55,300]  If you already mentioned that during the presentation, I'm sorry, but I did not catch it.\n",
            "[00:15:55,300 --> 00:15:58,300]  So I understand it will be $29 billion.\n",
            "[00:15:58,300 --> 00:16:01,300]  Would you choose to just pay it all up front\n",
            "[00:16:01,300 --> 00:16:05,300]  and would there be any additional debt that you would need to rest on the back of that?\n",
            "[00:16:05,300 --> 00:16:10,300]  Just a quick follow-up on the back of that question as well in terms of accounting,\n",
            "[00:16:10,300 --> 00:16:15,300]  the amortization of spectrum costs should start right now\n",
            "[00:16:15,300 --> 00:16:19,300]  or should start when you actually launch the service maybe toward the end of 2014?\n",
            "[00:16:19,300 --> 00:16:22,300]  How should I look at it? Thank you very much.\n",
            "[00:16:22,300 --> 00:16:30,460]  About the CAPEX level for 2014, we haven't finalized the selection of 4G vendors.\n",
            "[00:16:30,460 --> 00:16:33,460]  So at this moment, we are still evaluating.\n",
            "[00:16:33,460 --> 00:16:41,560]  Therefore, it's still early to say what will be the CAPEX level for next year.\n",
            "[00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:47,560]  Hopefully, in the next two or three weeks, we can finalize our selection process\n",
            "[00:16:47,560 --> 00:16:56,720]  and by that time, we will have a better idea regarding the CAPEX level we will have for 2014.\n",
            "[00:16:56,720 --> 00:17:02,720]  As for financing for spectrum and amortization, let me turn to Rosie to answer your question.\n",
            "[00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:08,720]  Yeah, we will definitely go for 100% payment up front.\n",
            "[00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:12,720]  There is no point for us to pay in installments.\n",
            "[00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:20,720]  As you know, the installments will require us to pay more than 5% per annum for the balance.\n",
            "[00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:29,720]  And there is no ‚Äì we will use short-term debt to finance the payment.\n",
            "[00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:32,720]  And actually, as you may have noticed,\n",
            "[00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:41,720]  that we have already raised $15.8 billion of straight bond since fourth quarter of last year\n",
            "[00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:44,820]  through the second quarter of this year.\n",
            "[00:17:44,820 --> 00:17:48,820]  One for $9 billion, the other one for $5.8 billion,\n",
            "[00:17:48,820 --> 00:17:52,820]  all at a very low interest rate or the lowest in the market.\n",
            "[00:17:52,820 --> 00:17:57,820]  For the seven-year straight bond, the interest rate was 1.34%\n",
            "[00:17:57,820 --> 00:18:05,820]  and for the five-year straight bond, the interest rate was 1.29%.\n",
            "[00:18:05,820 --> 00:18:12,850]  I believe it's the lowest in the marketplace for five and seven-year bond respectively.\n",
            "[00:18:12,850 --> 00:18:18,850]  And on the amortization, the amortization of the spectrum will only begin\n",
            "[00:18:18,850 --> 00:18:26,320]  when we get the license and commercially launch the service.\n",
            "[00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:32,320]  So that probably would be in like beginning of 2015, end of 2014 rather than now?\n",
            "[00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:36,320]  It depends on the time of the commercial launch.\n",
            "[00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:40,460]  That is awesome. Thank you very much.\n",
            "[00:18:45,090 --> 00:18:53,020]  Thank you. Next question comes from Joseph Quinn with Macquarie Taiwan.\n",
            "[00:18:53,020 --> 00:18:54,020]  Please go ahead. Thank you.\n",
            "[00:18:54,020 --> 00:18:58,060]  Thank you and congratulations on the solid set of results\n",
            "[00:18:58,060 --> 00:19:01,060]  and obviously a very good result on the 4G side.\n",
            "[00:19:01,060 --> 00:19:03,060]  I've just got two questions.\n",
            "[00:19:03,060 --> 00:19:11,060]  One on the 4G side, you mentioned in terms of you'll be planning to roll out both 700 and 1800 at the same time.\n",
            "[00:19:12,060 --> 00:19:14,060]  Is there any reasons behind that?\n",
            "[00:19:14,060 --> 00:19:19,060]  Would you see any hindrance in the near term for 700?\n",
            "[00:19:19,060 --> 00:19:24,060]  And just to chat through some of the issues you might see on devices and equipment available to you.\n",
            "[00:19:24,060 --> 00:19:29,060]  And the second is just in terms of your EBITDA performance in third quarter.\n",
            "[00:19:29,060 --> 00:19:33,060]  As you've seen, both your CBG and EBG have done very well.\n",
            "[00:19:33,060 --> 00:19:38,060]  Is that mainly a result of better control on headset subsidies\n",
            "[00:19:38,060 --> 00:19:41,060]  or is there something else in there that we should be aware of also?\n",
            "[00:19:41,060 --> 00:19:42,060]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:19:45,470 --> 00:19:50,500]  Since we have paid for the 700 and 1800, of course, from our point of view,\n",
            "[00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:54,500]  it would be better that we can utilize the spectrum in the 4G.\n",
            "[00:19:54,500 --> 00:20:00,500]  So hopefully, as I said, we need to negotiate with our counterpart like FET\n",
            "[00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:07,500]  to see whether we can have these 1800 freed up to launch the service.\n",
            "[00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:15,500]  So the plan is always prepare that we can reach certain resolution so we can launch 1800 too.\n",
            "[00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:21,500]  In 700, even though a lot of people think that the 700 is not mature enough,\n",
            "[00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:28,500]  but based on our talk with the vendors, they all promise they can deliver the 700 in due time.\n",
            "[00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:33,500]  So there will be no problem for us to launch 700 for next year.\n",
            "[00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:38,500]  As for devices for 700, based on my understanding,\n",
            "[00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:44,500]  Qualcomm will come out with 700 MHz chips in fourth quarter of this year.\n",
            "[00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:48,500]  So based on my talks with the headset vendors,\n",
            "[00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:57,500]  they all seem to confirm they can have 700 headsets by the time we prepare to launch the 700 service.\n",
            "[00:20:57,500 --> 00:21:01,500]  So there's no problem for us to launch 700.\n",
            "[00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:03,500]  And there's no problem in the equipment side.\n",
            "[00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:06,540]  There's no problem in the devices side.\n",
            "[00:21:06,540 --> 00:21:15,540]  For EPIDAR, we did try to manage our subsidy and the level at the end of the third quarter.\n",
            "[00:21:15,540 --> 00:21:21,540]  So that's why you see a better EPIDAR margin in the third quarter.\n",
            "[00:21:21,540 --> 00:21:25,540]  Hopefully, as you know, in the fourth quarter, we have this iPhone.\n",
            "[00:21:25,540 --> 00:21:29,540]  So we will try to manage to save some.\n",
            "[00:21:29,540 --> 00:21:31,540]  And it's really a continuing effort.\n",
            "[00:21:31,540 --> 00:21:40,540]  But due to the iPhone, we still have to see how many iPhone Apple will ship to us in the fourth quarter.\n",
            "[00:21:40,540 --> 00:21:47,540]  At this moment, it seems that they cannot deliver enough iPhone at the moment.\n",
            "[00:21:47,540 --> 00:21:54,540]  But we are not sure whether they can catch up in November or in December.\n",
            "[00:21:55,540 --> 00:22:04,540]  So the iPhone factor will affect our EPIDAR level in the fourth quarter.\n",
            "[00:22:04,540 --> 00:22:05,540]  Thanks.\n",
            "[00:22:05,540 --> 00:22:07,540]  And just a follow-up on both of those.\n",
            "[00:22:07,540 --> 00:22:16,540]  So in terms of the vendor side, as you said, you would expect 700 to be fully capable to have devices ready.\n",
            "[00:22:16,540 --> 00:22:22,540]  But what would you be expecting in terms of speed capabilities, given you have 15 megahertz?\n",
            "[00:22:22,540 --> 00:22:27,540]  For example, if you only have 10 megahertz in 700 and now you have 15 megahertz,\n",
            "[00:22:27,540 --> 00:22:33,540]  where would you see a difference in speed capabilities or what differences should we expect for that side?\n",
            "[00:22:33,540 --> 00:22:36,540]  Okay, excuse me. It's very easy.\n",
            "[00:22:36,540 --> 00:22:40,540]  If we have 1500, the other people have 10 megahertz.\n",
            "[00:22:40,540 --> 00:22:43,540]  If we have 15 megahertz, the other have 10.\n",
            "[00:22:43,540 --> 00:22:48,540]  Then our speed should be 50 percent faster than our competitors.\n",
            "[00:22:48,540 --> 00:22:50,540]  Got you. Got you. Okay.\n",
            "[00:22:50,540 --> 00:22:55,540]  So likewise, if Far Eastone are able to negotiate with you on their C4 block,\n",
            "[00:22:55,540 --> 00:22:57,540]  then they could benefit more from their 20 megahertz.\n",
            "[00:22:57,540 --> 00:22:59,540]  Well, it's a tricky question.\n",
            "[00:22:59,540 --> 00:23:00,540]  Okay.\n",
            "[00:23:02,540 --> 00:23:08,540]  I don't think in the near future the Far Eastone can provide 20 megahertz service\n",
            "[00:23:08,540 --> 00:23:12,540]  because it's subject to the business negotiation.\n",
            "[00:23:12,540 --> 00:23:19,540]  But let me assure you, I don't think they are able to launch 20 megahertz service in the near future\n",
            "[00:23:19,540 --> 00:23:21,540]  or in the next two or three years.\n",
            "[00:23:21,540 --> 00:23:23,540]  Before 2017?\n",
            "[00:23:23,540 --> 00:23:25,540]  Yes, before 2017.\n",
            "[00:23:25,540 --> 00:23:31,540]  It's really, they can only launch a 20 megahertz LTE service\n",
            "[00:23:31,540 --> 00:23:39,540]  after the 2G license has been returned to the NCC.\n",
            "[00:23:39,540 --> 00:23:43,540]  By that time, they will have full control of C3 and C4.\n",
            "[00:23:43,540 --> 00:23:45,540]  By that time, they can have 20 megahertz.\n",
            "[00:23:45,540 --> 00:23:49,760]  Without that, there's no way they can provide 20 megahertz.\n",
            "[00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:52,760]  I think the best they can provide is 10 megahertz.\n",
            "[00:23:52,760 --> 00:23:53,760]  Okay. Okay.\n",
            "[00:23:53,760 --> 00:24:00,760]  So should we read into then that maybe in the near term,\n",
            "[00:24:00,760 --> 00:24:03,760]  you wouldn't have full access to C1 as well?\n",
            "[00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:05,760]  Or how should we think about that given‚Ä¶\n",
            "[00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:10,760]  Well, I think it's really, if we can reach an agreement,\n",
            "[00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:20,760]  both FET and the telemobile can launch 1800 LTE service at roughly the same speed.\n",
            "[00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:25,860]  Okay. So you think it's maybe more of a negotiation on speed.\n",
            "[00:24:25,860 --> 00:24:28,860]  You wouldn't want them to have an advantage necessarily\n",
            "[00:24:28,860 --> 00:24:31,860]  until they have full access to the license?\n",
            "[00:24:31,860 --> 00:24:32,860]  Excuse me?\n",
            "[00:24:32,860 --> 00:24:38,860]  So in terms of negotiations between you, them, and the NCC,\n",
            "[00:24:38,860 --> 00:24:43,860]  maybe you wouldn't want them to be able to have full access to 20 megahertz speeds?\n",
            "[00:24:43,860 --> 00:24:49,860]  Well, it's really in the NCC regulation.\n",
            "[00:24:49,860 --> 00:24:53,860]  In their regulation, they stipulate that we can negotiate.\n",
            "[00:24:53,860 --> 00:24:59,890]  Suppose each one gets the other spectrum.\n",
            "[00:24:59,890 --> 00:25:05,890]  So during the negotiation, we will try to have an equal share or equal speed\n",
            "[00:25:05,890 --> 00:25:16,980]  so that we can have equal access to the spectrum and equal speed to launch the LTE.\n",
            "[00:25:16,980 --> 00:25:19,980]  Maybe Rosie will add some insight.\n",
            "[00:25:19,980 --> 00:25:33,210]  It will be easier for us to reach a consensus with equal speed or equal share of the spectrum.\n",
            "[00:25:33,210 --> 00:25:36,260]  Otherwise, it's impossible.\n",
            "[00:25:36,260 --> 00:25:38,260]  Yeah, that makes sense.\n",
            "[00:25:38,260 --> 00:25:42,260]  Okay. That's very helpful. Thank you very much.\n",
            "[00:25:42,260 --> 00:25:48,090]  Thank you. Our next question comes from Tian Dong with GRC Singapore. Thank you.\n",
            "[00:25:48,090 --> 00:25:53,090]  Hi. Good afternoon. Thanks very much for the opportunity to ask a few questions.\n",
            "[00:25:53,090 --> 00:25:58,090]  My questions are on tiered 4G data plans versus un-tiered.\n",
            "[00:25:58,090 --> 00:26:04,090]  Given that, I guess, the amounts paid for spectrum were a lot higher than market expectations,\n",
            "[00:26:05,090 --> 00:26:11,090]  is there any kind of business case for un-tiered 4G data plans or to make the economics work,\n",
            "[00:26:11,090 --> 00:26:15,090]  you really have to have tiered data plans?\n",
            "[00:26:15,090 --> 00:26:20,090]  Second question is, as the bidding was going along and the prices rose,\n",
            "[00:26:20,090 --> 00:26:25,090]  how much interaction was there with the regulators on tiering for 4G?\n",
            "[00:26:25,090 --> 00:26:29,090]  Were they becoming more open to that possibility as the prices rose\n",
            "[00:26:29,090 --> 00:26:34,090]  so that you would be able to recover the amounts that you're going to pay?\n",
            "[00:26:34,090 --> 00:26:41,090]  And the third question is just on the ‚Äì what are you thinking in terms of the potential revenue uplift\n",
            "[00:26:41,090 --> 00:26:47,090]  from acquiring this 4G spectrum in terms of an acceleration in your growth rate?\n",
            "[00:26:47,090 --> 00:26:53,980]  What are your ideas about that? Thank you.\n",
            "[00:26:53,980 --> 00:27:05,260]  Regarding the tiered pricing, I think even NCC realized tiered pricing is the trend\n",
            "[00:27:05,260 --> 00:27:08,260]  and is the way to go in the 4G.\n",
            "[00:27:08,260 --> 00:27:15,260]  And so I think the actual implementation of tiered pricing will happen in 4G.\n",
            "[00:27:15,260 --> 00:27:22,260]  But for 3G, we don't see ‚Äì we won't see this happen, but in 4G, definitely.\n",
            "[00:27:22,260 --> 00:27:29,260]  And so in our business model, we have incorporated the tiered pricing in our business model.\n",
            "[00:27:29,260 --> 00:27:43,260]  And based on this tiered pricing, we expect a certain ARPU improvement in the subscribers.\n",
            "[00:27:43,260 --> 00:27:55,940]  Therefore, even though we pay $29 billion for spectrum, but based on our calculations,\n",
            "[00:27:55,940 --> 00:28:03,940]  we still can get return and get a decent return from our 4G investment.\n",
            "[00:28:03,940 --> 00:28:15,030]  Please bear in mind, of all the operators, our cost is the lowest compared with our competitors,\n",
            "[00:28:15,030 --> 00:28:17,030]  the major competitors.\n",
            "[00:28:17,030 --> 00:28:27,250]  And therefore, we are a little optimistic regarding our 4G investments.\n",
            "[00:28:27,250 --> 00:28:34,110]  And $29 billion isn't higher than expected.\n",
            "[00:28:34,110 --> 00:28:37,740]  All right. Thank you.\n",
            "[00:28:37,740 --> 00:28:41,740]  Thank you. Our next question comes from Stephen Liu with Standard Chartered Bank Hong Kong.\n",
            "[00:28:41,740 --> 00:28:42,740]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:28:42,740 --> 00:28:46,740]  Thank you. I have two questions. First, regarding who are you ‚Äì\n",
            "[00:28:46,740 --> 00:28:51,740]  I think you use the Nokia as your 3G, 2G supplier.\n",
            "[00:28:51,740 --> 00:28:58,740]  Are there still any restrictions from the NCC on using the Chinese like Huawei, ZTE, telecom equipment?\n",
            "[00:28:59,740 --> 00:29:06,740]  Or just the restriction on the call network or any restriction on the access network is the first question.\n",
            "[00:29:06,740 --> 00:29:14,740]  Second, regarding when is the earliest time can you start using after the 4G on 1800?\n",
            "[00:29:14,740 --> 00:29:19,740]  And what is the maximum block you can use for the time being in 1800?\n",
            "[00:29:19,740 --> 00:29:24,510]  Can you remind me if I missed this? Thank you.\n",
            "[00:29:24,510 --> 00:29:35,510]  Whether we can use the Chinese-made network equipment is still an issue we need to check with NCC.\n",
            "[00:29:35,510 --> 00:29:39,740]  So this is still something up in the air.\n",
            "[00:29:39,740 --> 00:29:44,280]  We will try to find out in the next several weeks.\n",
            "[00:29:44,280 --> 00:29:48,820]  As for when can we launch the 1800,\n",
            "[00:29:48,820 --> 00:30:00,270]  due to the one we will have is currently occupied by FPT.\n",
            "[00:30:00,270 --> 00:30:04,270]  Therefore, it will be subject to negotiation.\n",
            "[00:30:04,270 --> 00:30:12,270]  Based on NCC regulations, any negotiation needs to be settled in the next six months\n",
            "[00:30:12,270 --> 00:30:16,270]  in order to facilitate the launch of the 1800.\n",
            "[00:30:16,270 --> 00:30:20,270]  So we will try to work with FPT.\n",
            "[00:30:20,270 --> 00:30:23,270]  I think we both share the same interest.\n",
            "[00:30:23,270 --> 00:30:30,270]  So we will try to see whether we can reach a good resolution\n",
            "[00:30:30,270 --> 00:30:36,270]  and hopefully we can launch the 1800 in 2014.\n",
            "[00:30:37,750 --> 00:30:40,750]  Do we need to negotiate with CNT?\n",
            "[00:30:40,750 --> 00:30:45,750]  Because there are some also occupied by CNT on the 1800.\n",
            "[00:30:45,750 --> 00:30:52,750]  In that case, we don't share mutual interest with CNT.\n",
            "[00:30:52,750 --> 00:30:56,750]  So I don't think CNT will release that spectrum.\n",
            "[00:30:56,750 --> 00:31:03,780]  But the fact of the matter is that we have C1 which is occupied by FPT\n",
            "[00:31:03,780 --> 00:31:08,780]  and FPT has a C4 which is occupied by TWM.\n",
            "[00:31:08,780 --> 00:31:15,140]  Therefore, we have mutual interest to reach a settlement.\n",
            "[00:31:17,300 --> 00:31:20,300]  And also maybe a follow-up question on OMOMO.\n",
            "[00:31:20,300 --> 00:31:26,300]  Revenue is quite stable, I think, but the EBITDA margin is declining still on the downtrend.\n",
            "[00:31:27,300 --> 00:31:30,300]  Can you give me some outlook on that?\n",
            "[00:31:30,300 --> 00:31:36,740]  Can we expect a stabilizing EBITDA margin going forward on the OMOMO business?\n",
            "[00:31:36,740 --> 00:31:44,740]  They are expected to reach their target for this year despite declining EBITDA margin.\n",
            "[00:31:44,740 --> 00:31:53,370]  So we basically think that they should be okay.\n",
            "[00:31:55,660 --> 00:31:58,660]  And are they profitable on the bottom line?\n",
            "[00:31:58,660 --> 00:31:59,660]  Of course.\n",
            "[00:31:59,660 --> 00:32:01,660]  Okay, I agree. Thank you.\n",
            "[00:32:03,660 --> 00:32:05,200]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:08,200]  Our next question comes from Gary Yu with Mobius Daily Hong Kong.\n",
            "[00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:09,200]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:32:10,680 --> 00:32:13,680]  Hi. Thank you for the opportunity to ask questions.\n",
            "[00:32:13,680 --> 00:32:17,680]  I have three questions which are all follow-up from the previous questions.\n",
            "[00:32:18,680 --> 00:32:20,680]  First one on voice revenue.\n",
            "[00:32:20,680 --> 00:32:28,680]  Do you have a breakdown of the current voice revenue between customer paying for the flat fee of monthly fee?\n",
            "[00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:34,680]  And customers paying for additional voice usage beyond their monthly voice allowance?\n",
            "[00:32:35,680 --> 00:32:37,710]  Second question on tier pricing.\n",
            "[00:32:37,710 --> 00:32:44,710]  You mentioned that tier pricing will be implemented when you launch 4G, but not quite possible for 3G.\n",
            "[00:32:45,710 --> 00:32:54,710]  Just wanted to understand when you launch 4G, are you going to have a parallel set or different set of 3G service plans\n",
            "[00:32:55,710 --> 00:32:58,710]  which customers can choose unlimited data on 3G?\n",
            "[00:32:58,710 --> 00:33:05,710]  Or you will move to tier pricing for 3G also when you launch 4G service?\n",
            "[00:33:06,710 --> 00:33:10,710]  Last question, again on your negotiation with Forest Home.\n",
            "[00:33:11,710 --> 00:33:18,710]  Given you own 50 MHz in 1800 band and they own 10,\n",
            "[00:33:18,710 --> 00:33:25,710]  in the negotiation process, do you think one of the parties will need to settle with dollar amount\n",
            "[00:33:26,710 --> 00:33:32,710]  given they will have to release 15 and you will only have to release 10 to them?\n",
            "[00:33:32,710 --> 00:33:33,710]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:33:35,260 --> 00:33:38,260]  The first issue, I am not sure I understand the first issue.\n",
            "[00:33:38,260 --> 00:33:40,260]  But let me answer the second question.\n",
            "[00:33:41,260 --> 00:33:43,260]  The second question regarding tier pricing.\n",
            "[00:33:43,260 --> 00:33:52,640]  We are studying tier pricing, but how to couple with our 3G is still something we are working on.\n",
            "[00:33:53,640 --> 00:33:57,640]  So at this moment, I am sorry, I don't have any new information to disclose.\n",
            "[00:33:58,640 --> 00:34:04,640]  I think we will have some idea maybe by the first half of the year.\n",
            "[00:34:05,640 --> 00:34:10,640]  Regarding the negotiation, the negotiation with the FET,\n",
            "[00:34:11,640 --> 00:34:18,830]  I don't think it will involve any expense or any cash transaction.\n",
            "[00:34:19,830 --> 00:34:22,830]  It's really an exchange of spectrum.\n",
            "[00:34:23,830 --> 00:34:29,060]  So it's really, it will be fair, it will be on a fair basis.\n",
            "[00:34:30,060 --> 00:34:35,060]  It wouldn't be, I think if it's not fair, the other side wouldn't agree.\n",
            "[00:34:36,060 --> 00:34:42,060]  So it won't happen like they have 15, we have 10 or something like that.\n",
            "[00:34:43,220 --> 00:34:48,220]  So in the end, the settlement should be mutually beneficial.\n",
            "[00:34:51,170 --> 00:34:52,170]  That's for the first one.\n",
            "[00:34:58,510 --> 00:35:00,510]  Let me try to rephrase my first question.\n",
            "[00:35:00,510 --> 00:35:08,510]  Because right now when customers are paying for voice charges to our mobile,\n",
            "[00:35:09,510 --> 00:35:14,510]  a part of that is actually embedded in the monthly fee, which they paid a flat rate per month.\n",
            "[00:35:15,510 --> 00:35:19,510]  And then the customer is entitled to certain amount of voice minutes.\n",
            "[00:35:20,510 --> 00:35:24,510]  And if the customer is beyond that, then they need to pay additional charge on a per minute basis.\n",
            "[00:35:25,510 --> 00:35:29,510]  I just want to check with you on your current voice revenue.\n",
            "[00:35:30,510 --> 00:35:37,510]  What is the contribution of the amount that customers paid on SX voice usage as opposed to the monthly fee?\n",
            "[00:36:19,050 --> 00:36:24,050]  We'll check into the numbers and get back to you soon.\n",
            "[00:36:25,050 --> 00:36:29,460]  And you can continue your Q&A.\n",
            "[00:36:31,840 --> 00:36:32,840]  Okay, thank you.\n",
            "[00:36:34,450 --> 00:36:37,450]  Our next question comes from Jingjing Wang with UBS China.\n",
            "[00:36:38,450 --> 00:36:40,540]  Yes, I have two questions.\n",
            "[00:36:41,540 --> 00:36:50,540]  First of all, regarding capex, I understand our capex might go up, particularly in the initial stage of 4G.\n",
            "[00:36:51,540 --> 00:37:02,540]  But whether it is reasonable to assume that the total capex for our 4G rollout should not be higher than that of 3G,\n",
            "[00:37:02,540 --> 00:37:06,540]  I mean, accumulatively, in the next, say, three to four years.\n",
            "[00:37:07,540 --> 00:37:08,540]  That's number one.\n",
            "[00:37:08,540 --> 00:37:18,540]  Number two, based on the bidding results yesterday, what do you think of the potential competition from new entrants,\n",
            "[00:37:18,540 --> 00:37:24,540]  particularly Honghai Group, because they won two blocks of factoring?\n",
            "[00:37:25,540 --> 00:37:42,590]  Well, as for the capex, based on our understanding, the capex, the equipment cost for 4G per unit cost, per mega cost,\n",
            "[00:37:42,590 --> 00:37:44,590]  should be lower than 3G.\n",
            "[00:37:45,590 --> 00:37:58,260]  So the accumulated capex expenditure for 4G may, logically, should be lower than the accumulated 3G capex.\n",
            "[00:38:01,260 --> 00:38:06,940]  But we haven't seen the end of the 3G life cycle.\n",
            "[00:38:07,940 --> 00:38:19,030]  Therefore, as you know, right now the 3G network only carries more than 3 million data customers.\n",
            "[00:38:19,030 --> 00:38:24,030]  In the future, the 4G network may carry 7 million or 8 million.\n",
            "[00:38:24,030 --> 00:38:27,030]  So it's really not an apple-to-apple comparison.\n",
            "[00:38:27,030 --> 00:38:38,500]  But the cost per unit, per mega, for 4G is significantly lower than 3G.\n",
            "[00:38:38,500 --> 00:38:40,890]  That's for sure.\n",
            "[00:38:40,890 --> 00:38:44,890]  The second question is the competition from the new entrants.\n",
            "[00:38:46,050 --> 00:38:51,050]  We don't see any serious competition in 2014.\n",
            "[00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:57,720]  We may see some new entrants start to make some moves in 2015.\n",
            "[00:38:57,720 --> 00:39:01,720]  But it's too early to say now.\n",
            "[00:39:01,720 --> 00:39:06,820]  Whether the competition will intensify in 2015 is too early to say.\n",
            "[00:39:06,820 --> 00:39:14,820]  But as for 2014, I think it's really the competition is still limited to the major three.\n",
            "[00:39:17,640 --> 00:39:18,640]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:22,640]  I have another question regarding the voice revenue.\n",
            "[00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:31,640]  Because currently I see voice per minute tariff still quite high in Taiwan compared with regional peers.\n",
            "[00:39:31,640 --> 00:39:37,640]  And MOU, as a matter of fact, is probably the lowest in the region.\n",
            "[00:39:37,640 --> 00:39:50,640]  So I'm just wondering, because investors are concerned the legacy risk of our still very high voice revenue share, like 65%.\n",
            "[00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:58,640]  So I'm just wondering, in the next two to three years, if we lower the tariff per minute,\n",
            "[00:39:58,640 --> 00:40:05,670]  whether the price elasticity should kick in and help offset the tariff decline.\n",
            "[00:40:05,670 --> 00:40:15,670]  And whether there is a chance we could launch even flat rate plan, say unlimited voice traffic,\n",
            "[00:40:15,670 --> 00:40:19,670]  with such a plan in the next two to three years?\n",
            "[00:40:20,670 --> 00:40:26,670]  Well, you know, each country has its unique market environment.\n",
            "[00:40:26,670 --> 00:40:32,670]  Because of the interconnection fee and the nature of the market,\n",
            "[00:40:32,670 --> 00:40:41,220]  traditionally the voice, the per minute charge is higher.\n",
            "[00:40:41,220 --> 00:40:49,600]  But on the other hand, the subsidy level in Taiwan is a little higher than the other countries.\n",
            "[00:40:49,600 --> 00:40:59,630]  So you either pay through per minute charge, or you either have lower per minute charge,\n",
            "[00:40:59,630 --> 00:41:04,630]  then the customer may not get the kind of subsidy they have.\n",
            "[00:41:05,730 --> 00:41:13,020]  And as far as I can see, in the next two or three years, I wouldn't say three years and beyond,\n",
            "[00:41:13,020 --> 00:41:19,020]  in the next two years, I don't see you will have a situation that you have like unlimited voice plan.\n",
            "[00:41:19,020 --> 00:41:27,020]  Because the interconnection charge is to consist of a major component of our cost.\n",
            "[00:41:27,020 --> 00:41:30,020]  So I don't think that kind of plan will work.\n",
            "[00:41:30,020 --> 00:41:39,020]  Therefore, but because of the smartphone and the popularity of the instant messaging,\n",
            "[00:41:39,020 --> 00:41:46,020]  we continue to see, we will see continuing decline in the voice revenue.\n",
            "[00:41:47,020 --> 00:41:55,180]  So, and I don't see by reducing voice charge per minute,\n",
            "[00:41:55,180 --> 00:42:02,180]  can stimulate the usage of the subscribers,\n",
            "[00:42:02,180 --> 00:42:08,180]  and which in turn will compensate the discount of the voice charge,\n",
            "[00:42:08,180 --> 00:42:11,180]  so that we will have better voice revenue.\n",
            "[00:42:11,180 --> 00:42:13,180]  No, I don't think that will happen.\n",
            "[00:42:13,180 --> 00:42:18,660]  So I think all the operators will have this kind of status quo.\n",
            "[00:42:18,660 --> 00:42:20,660]  Our strategy will remain the same.\n",
            "[00:42:20,660 --> 00:42:23,660]  Continue pushing for the data revenue,\n",
            "[00:42:23,660 --> 00:42:29,900]  while in the meantime try to stop the declining of voice revenue.\n",
            "[00:42:29,900 --> 00:42:30,900]  Okay, thank you.\n",
            "[00:42:30,900 --> 00:42:33,600]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:42:33,600 --> 00:42:36,600]  Our next question comes from Lucy Liu with JPMorgan Hong Kong.\n",
            "[00:42:36,600 --> 00:42:37,600]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:42:37,600 --> 00:42:42,700]  Hi, I do have a few quick questions.\n",
            "[00:42:42,700 --> 00:42:44,700]  So one is still on 4G spectrum.\n",
            "[00:42:44,700 --> 00:42:48,700]  So I understand that you mentioned you would do the fair trade with 5G,\n",
            "[00:42:48,700 --> 00:42:52,700]  but then even after the trade you got the C4,\n",
            "[00:42:52,700 --> 00:42:56,700]  but then that's the 2G spectrum for the current, for the time being.\n",
            "[00:42:56,700 --> 00:43:01,700]  So does that mean you need to clean up your 2G customer or migrate them first\n",
            "[00:43:01,700 --> 00:43:05,700]  before you can return the 2G license to NTT?\n",
            "[00:43:05,700 --> 00:43:08,700]  Just the one that I think you still have 1 million 2G customer now.\n",
            "[00:43:08,700 --> 00:43:10,700]  How quickly that migration can be done?\n",
            "[00:43:10,700 --> 00:43:12,700]  So this is number one.\n",
            "[00:43:12,700 --> 00:43:14,700]  Number two is that, you know,\n",
            "[00:43:14,700 --> 00:43:19,700]  you mentioned that you will do 4G on both 700 and C-band.\n",
            "[00:43:19,700 --> 00:43:24,700]  So can we assume that you will negotiate with Firestone first in the next six months?\n",
            "[00:43:24,700 --> 00:43:31,700]  If there's no deal can be done, then you will be moving to A-band for 4G launch.\n",
            "[00:43:31,700 --> 00:43:36,700]  But if there's any deal can be done, you won't touch A-band for the time being.\n",
            "[00:43:36,700 --> 00:43:39,700]  This is more like a technical kind of question.\n",
            "[00:43:39,700 --> 00:43:41,700]  And lastly is also on dividends.\n",
            "[00:43:41,700 --> 00:43:44,700]  So I just wonder your dividend policy.\n",
            "[00:43:44,700 --> 00:43:49,700]  You have definitely some special reserve to pay more special dividends.\n",
            "[00:43:49,700 --> 00:43:53,700]  Given that EPS probably will see some downside due to the spectrum payments.\n",
            "[00:43:53,700 --> 00:43:56,700]  Just what's the dividend policy?\n",
            "[00:43:56,700 --> 00:43:57,700]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:43:58,700 --> 00:44:04,730]  Well, based on the mobile broadband regulation,\n",
            "[00:44:12,910 --> 00:44:15,910]  the mobile broadband regulations,\n",
            "[00:44:15,910 --> 00:44:20,910]  regulations 81 and 44,\n",
            "[00:44:20,910 --> 00:44:28,200]  Taiwan Mobile can swap spectrum with the FET.\n",
            "[00:44:28,200 --> 00:44:32,200]  And then we can, if we launch the LTE,\n",
            "[00:44:32,200 --> 00:44:35,200]  we can release the spectrum for each other.\n",
            "[00:44:35,200 --> 00:44:39,230]  So there will be arrangements.\n",
            "[00:44:39,230 --> 00:44:49,230]  It is possible to have both FET and TWM to have 2G subscribers to put in certain spectrum\n",
            "[00:44:49,230 --> 00:44:53,330]  and leave certain spectrum for LTE.\n",
            "[00:44:53,330 --> 00:44:58,330]  This is the reason why by the end of the auction,\n",
            "[00:44:58,330 --> 00:45:03,330]  Taiwan Mobile and FET can end this auction\n",
            "[00:45:03,330 --> 00:45:10,330]  because we know there is a way to resolve this problem.\n",
            "[00:45:10,330 --> 00:45:15,330]  If there is no way to resolve this problem, I don't think the auction will end.\n",
            "[00:45:15,330 --> 00:45:21,330]  So if you look at the regulation 81 and regulation 44,\n",
            "[00:45:22,330 --> 00:45:27,330]  it's a little complicated to explain in the conference,\n",
            "[00:45:27,330 --> 00:45:33,330]  but there is a way to resolve our situation.\n",
            "[00:45:35,330 --> 00:45:38,330]  And therefore, as I said,\n",
            "[00:45:38,330 --> 00:45:45,420]  we will launch 700 and we will also launch 1,800\n",
            "[00:45:45,420 --> 00:45:50,420]  subject to successful negotiation with FET.\n",
            "[00:45:51,420 --> 00:45:57,880]  And on the dividend policy,\n",
            "[00:45:57,880 --> 00:46:06,420]  you all know that our dividend policy is decided by the board in every April each year.\n",
            "[00:46:06,420 --> 00:46:13,420]  The 4G auction, actually, the result is better than expected.\n",
            "[00:46:16,420 --> 00:46:19,710]  So we will leave the...\n",
            "[00:46:19,710 --> 00:46:22,710]  Well, based on the better than expected auction results,\n",
            "[00:46:22,710 --> 00:46:26,710]  we don't think it's an issue funding-wise.\n",
            "[00:46:26,710 --> 00:46:28,710]  Let me put it this way.\n",
            "[00:46:28,710 --> 00:46:33,710]  And I will also like to remind you that our major shareholders' interests\n",
            "[00:46:33,710 --> 00:46:36,710]  are pretty much aligned with yours.\n",
            "[00:46:36,710 --> 00:46:39,600]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:46:39,600 --> 00:46:43,600]  Okay, sorry, just to add two more questions.\n",
            "[00:46:43,600 --> 00:46:45,600]  One is on the cable side, you know,\n",
            "[00:46:45,600 --> 00:46:50,600]  we saw some rezoning policy and some new licenses given to the new entrants.\n",
            "[00:46:50,600 --> 00:46:54,600]  So is there any progress happening there?\n",
            "[00:46:54,600 --> 00:46:56,600]  And secondly is what's your data traffic,\n",
            "[00:46:56,600 --> 00:46:58,600]  smartphone per user per month now?\n",
            "[00:46:58,600 --> 00:47:02,530]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:47:02,530 --> 00:47:10,530]  Even though the NCC allows the competition in each SO,\n",
            "[00:47:10,530 --> 00:47:13,530]  and there are some new entrants,\n",
            "[00:47:13,530 --> 00:47:19,530]  but the new entrants will not start their service\n",
            "[00:47:19,530 --> 00:47:23,530]  until roughly the second half of the next year.\n",
            "[00:47:23,530 --> 00:47:28,530]  So even if they start the service,\n",
            "[00:47:28,530 --> 00:47:32,530]  it will be quite limited because, you know,\n",
            "[00:47:32,530 --> 00:47:39,530]  the cable is really a big infrastructure business and operation.\n",
            "[00:47:39,530 --> 00:47:46,530]  So we won't see any major impact on our cable business.\n",
            "[00:47:46,530 --> 00:47:50,530]  Whether this will happen in 2015,\n",
            "[00:47:50,530 --> 00:47:55,530]  then it's too early to say whether there will be major impact.\n",
            "[00:47:55,530 --> 00:48:00,530]  But from my point of view, it seems that in 2014,\n",
            "[00:48:00,530 --> 00:48:11,390]  even there may be some new entrants, but the impact is minor.\n",
            "[00:48:11,390 --> 00:48:19,870]  So the smartphone users' average usage is around 2.6 gig in the third quarter.\n",
            "[00:48:19,870 --> 00:48:21,870]  Thank you very much.\n",
            "[00:48:21,870 --> 00:48:25,870]  The previous question regarding in our voice revenue,\n",
            "[00:48:25,870 --> 00:48:30,870]  how much is from access fee, how much is from the airtime,\n",
            "[00:48:30,870 --> 00:48:36,870]  53% is from access fee, 47% is from airtime.\n",
            "[00:48:36,870 --> 00:48:46,860]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:48:46,860 --> 00:48:51,860]  The next question comes from Vicky Lin with Merrill Lynch Hong Kong. Thank you.\n",
            "[00:48:51,860 --> 00:48:53,860]  Thank you. This is Sydney Zhang from Merrill Lynch.\n",
            "[00:48:53,860 --> 00:48:56,860]  Thank you for the opportunity to ask questions.\n",
            "[00:48:56,860 --> 00:48:57,860]  I have three questions.\n",
            "[00:48:57,860 --> 00:49:01,860]  The first one still comes back to this negotiation with FET.\n",
            "[00:49:01,860 --> 00:49:05,860]  I know you guys may have some, you know, hidden agreement, you know,\n",
            "[00:49:05,860 --> 00:49:09,860]  but I still don't understand, you know, why FET have, you know,\n",
            "[00:49:09,860 --> 00:49:11,860]  incentive to swap that with you.\n",
            "[00:49:11,860 --> 00:49:14,860]  You know, because if they don't do anything,\n",
            "[00:49:14,860 --> 00:49:18,860]  they will still have, you know, C3 to launch, like, 2x10 megahertz,\n",
            "[00:49:18,860 --> 00:49:21,860]  and you don't have anything on 1800 megahertz.\n",
            "[00:49:21,860 --> 00:49:26,860]  Even though you guys can swap, for example, you can only swap maybe 2x5 megahertz,\n",
            "[00:49:26,860 --> 00:49:31,860]  then you only end up with, like, 2x5 megahertz on C1 to launch 4G.\n",
            "[00:49:31,860 --> 00:49:36,860]  So you still end up, like, not as good as, you know, the other two companies.\n",
            "[00:49:36,860 --> 00:49:43,860]  Or maybe you can, like, build a commonly shared network on the 1800 megahertz.\n",
            "[00:49:43,860 --> 00:49:46,860]  Can you share a little more lights on that?\n",
            "[00:49:46,860 --> 00:49:50,860]  My second question is on your 4G deployment strategy,\n",
            "[00:49:50,860 --> 00:49:54,860]  are you focusing more on the hotspots kind of deployment,\n",
            "[00:49:54,860 --> 00:49:58,860]  or are you going to, you know, really trying to cover the whole, you know,\n",
            "[00:49:58,860 --> 00:50:01,860]  whole Taiwan island?\n",
            "[00:50:01,860 --> 00:50:06,860]  And third question is, you know, this afternoon we saw the news, you know,\n",
            "[00:50:06,860 --> 00:50:10,860]  these comments made by the Hong Hai chairman.\n",
            "[00:50:10,860 --> 00:50:12,860]  He was saying that when they launch the 4G services,\n",
            "[00:50:12,860 --> 00:50:16,860]  then they will actually offer voice and SMS for free.\n",
            "[00:50:16,860 --> 00:50:18,860]  So any comments from you on that?\n",
            "[00:50:18,860 --> 00:50:20,860]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:50:20,860 --> 00:50:31,370]  First, your understanding of the issues, the FET and our issue is totally wrong.\n",
            "[00:50:31,370 --> 00:50:37,370]  FET, even though they control the C3, they cannot launch.\n",
            "[00:50:37,370 --> 00:50:42,370]  If they launch C3, if they launch LTE service in C3,\n",
            "[00:50:42,370 --> 00:50:47,370]  first, in C3, they only have 8.75 megahertz.\n",
            "[00:50:47,370 --> 00:50:52,370]  In order to launch LTE, you need to have 5 megahertz.\n",
            "[00:50:52,370 --> 00:50:59,370]  And if they launch 5 megahertz LTE, which the performance is roughly like 3G,\n",
            "[00:50:59,370 --> 00:51:07,370]  by regulation, if they launch in C3 with a 5 megahertz LTE,\n",
            "[00:51:07,370 --> 00:51:11,370]  they need to release the spectrum in C1 to us.\n",
            "[00:51:11,370 --> 00:51:19,530]  So Taiwan Mobile will have 11.25 megahertz LTE spectrum.\n",
            "[00:51:19,530 --> 00:51:21,530]  We can launch our LTE.\n",
            "[00:51:21,530 --> 00:51:31,690]  And then the FET wouldn't have spectrum to accommodate their 2G subscribers.\n",
            "[00:51:31,690 --> 00:51:36,690]  So there is no way they can launch any service in C3.\n",

            "[00:51:44,180 --> 00:51:51,240]  So the only issue is that they are a little bit less than 2 by 10 megahertz, right?\n",
            "[00:51:51,240 --> 00:51:53,240]  That's the key issue?\n",

            "[00:51:55,240 --> 00:52:02,240]  So the only thing what they lack of is that 2 by 10 megahertz,\n",

            "[00:52:17,240 --> 00:52:22,240]  the spectrum will return to NCC and the NCC will give the spectrum to us.\n",
            "[00:52:22,240 --> 00:52:26,240]  Then they have to get rid of their 2G.\n",
            "[00:52:26,240 --> 00:52:30,240]  Because the NCC original regulation,\n",
            "[00:52:30,240 --> 00:52:37,240]  they don't want to see that each operator fits for other people's territory\n",
            "[00:52:37,240 --> 00:52:42,240]  and launch certain service in other people's territory without releasing.\n",

            "[00:52:59,750 --> 00:53:05,750]  if they launch C1, they need to release spectrum in the C3.\n",
            "[00:53:05,750 --> 00:53:10,750]  Because suppose you can launch LTE service in one place,\n",
            "[00:53:10,750 --> 00:53:14,750]  you need to return the spectrum to NCC.\n",
            "[00:53:14,750 --> 00:53:18,750]  Therefore, it's a very complicated issue.\n",
            "[00:53:18,750 --> 00:53:21,750]  You really have to read the regulation.\n",
            "[00:53:21,750 --> 00:53:26,750]  Therefore, let me tell you definitely and affirmatively,\n",
            "[00:53:27,750 --> 00:53:31,750]  there is no way for FET to launch any 1800 service\n",
            "[00:53:31,750 --> 00:53:35,750]  without any negotiation with Taiwan Mobile.\n",
            "[00:53:35,750 --> 00:53:38,910]  No way. Period.\n",
            "[00:53:38,910 --> 00:53:48,080]  In the meantime, Taiwan Mobile can launch 750 MHz service,\n",
            "[00:53:48,080 --> 00:54:00,480]  which is 50% faster than FET's 10 MHz.\n",
            "[00:54:00,480 --> 00:54:06,480]  So our 4G deployment plan is, of course, island-wide.\n",
            "[00:54:06,480 --> 00:54:09,480]  We don't tend to just serve hotspots.\n",
            "[00:54:09,480 --> 00:54:18,510]  And of course, FACOM and Carrie Goh is a very successful businessman.\n",
            "[00:54:18,510 --> 00:54:22,510]  But as you know, the 4G doesn't have a voice network.\n",
            "[00:54:22,510 --> 00:54:29,510]  Even if they launch 4G network, they still need to have a 3G fallback.\n",
            "[00:54:29,510 --> 00:54:36,510]  So it's very interesting to see how FACOM is going to resolve the issue\n",
            "[00:54:36,510 --> 00:54:39,510]  that even though they have 4G spectrum,\n",
            "[00:54:39,510 --> 00:54:45,510]  but they still need a 3G network to accommodate the voice traffic.\n",
            "[00:54:45,510 --> 00:54:54,260]  Okay. Thank you. Thank you.\n",
            "[00:54:54,260 --> 00:54:58,260]  I understand much better now. Thank you.\n",
            "[00:54:58,260 --> 00:54:59,260]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:54:59,260 --> 00:55:02,260]  Our next question comes from Neil Anderson with HSBC Hong Kong.\n",
            "[00:55:02,260 --> 00:55:04,260]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:55:04,260 --> 00:55:05,260]  Hi. Good afternoon. Thank you.\n",
            "[00:55:05,260 --> 00:55:09,260]  Just coming back to the idea of tiered data pricing with 4G.\n",
            "[00:55:09,260 --> 00:55:13,260]  So it seems clear that the NCC is supportive, which is great.\n",
            "[00:55:13,260 --> 00:55:15,260]  But I just wanted to ask you a general question.\n",
            "[00:55:15,260 --> 00:55:18,260]  I mean, this is effectively a price increase.\n",
            "[00:55:18,260 --> 00:55:21,260]  And I believe there's been some commentary already to the effect\n",
            "[00:55:21,260 --> 00:55:24,260]  that the government's gain in high spectrum revenues\n",
            "[00:55:24,260 --> 00:55:28,260]  shouldn't be consumer losses in higher telecom fees.\n",
            "[00:55:28,260 --> 00:55:33,260]  So in other markets, the move to tiered pricing was basically okay by regulators\n",
            "[00:55:33,260 --> 00:55:36,260]  because networks were under enormous pressure.\n",
            "[00:55:36,260 --> 00:55:39,260]  But I don't believe that's the case yet in Taiwan.\n",
            "[00:55:39,260 --> 00:55:43,260]  So I know you can't give a straight yes or no answer to this.\n",
            "[00:55:43,260 --> 00:55:49,260]  But I guess I'm wondering if you're able to introduce tiers at 2GB or 3GB,\n",
            "[00:55:49,260 --> 00:55:53,260]  it would make a fairly quick improvement in your data revenues,\n",
            "[00:55:53,260 --> 00:55:56,260]  whereas 5 or 7 would be a different matter\n",
            "[00:55:56,260 --> 00:55:59,260]  and just limit downside risk to your network.\n",
            "[00:55:59,260 --> 00:56:04,260]  Why don't I just put that one to you to get your views?\n",
            "[00:56:04,260 --> 00:56:11,260]  I think the NCC also realized that this time the total cost is pretty high.\n",
            "[00:56:11,260 --> 00:56:14,260]  So I think they understand.\n",
            "[00:56:14,260 --> 00:56:19,260]  I think they know that it's necessary to have tiered pricing.\n",
            "[00:56:19,260 --> 00:56:24,260]  Otherwise, the operators will have little room to maneuver.\n",
            "[00:56:24,260 --> 00:56:27,260]  But in the meantime, I think they will try to emphasize that\n",
            "[00:56:27,260 --> 00:56:31,260]  even though you have tiered pricing, in the 4G network,\n",
            "[00:56:31,260 --> 00:56:40,260]  you still have to have lower monthly fee for average consumers.\n",
            "[00:56:40,260 --> 00:56:46,260]  So I think they are really concerned whether the entry tariff for 4G,\n",
            "[00:56:46,260 --> 00:56:51,260]  whether we provide options for those low-end subscribers,\n",
            "[00:56:51,260 --> 00:56:55,260]  whether the low-end subscriber can use the 4G service.\n",
            "[00:56:55,260 --> 00:56:59,260]  So in a way, we will provide many different tiered pricings\n",
            "[00:56:59,260 --> 00:57:02,260]  to accommodate different users,\n",
            "[00:57:02,260 --> 00:57:08,260]  even though for those people who cannot afford very high data fee,\n",
            "[00:57:08,260 --> 00:57:12,260]  we will try to provide a low monthly charge\n",
            "[00:57:12,260 --> 00:57:18,260]  with a reasonable package so that you can enjoy the 4G.\n",
            "[00:57:18,260 --> 00:57:22,260]  So I think that's the focus of the NCC in the future,\n",
            "[00:57:23,260 --> 00:57:28,260]  is to make sure that we all have packaging programs\n",
            "[00:57:28,260 --> 00:57:32,940]  for low-end subscribers.\n",
            "[00:57:32,940 --> 00:57:33,940]  Okay, thank you.\n",
            "[00:57:33,940 --> 00:57:38,940]  Could I ask one additional question on the enterprise business group,\n",
            "[00:57:38,940 --> 00:57:40,940]  particularly on mobile service revenue?\n",
            "[00:57:40,940 --> 00:57:46,940]  So I think that was 13% growth year-on-year in the second quarter,\n",
            "[00:57:46,940 --> 00:57:48,940]  18% this year.\n",
            "[00:57:48,940 --> 00:57:51,940]  The reason is given a rise in mobile subscribers,\n",
            "[00:57:51,940 --> 00:57:52,940]  something different that you're doing there\n",
            "[00:57:52,940 --> 00:57:54,940]  that you weren't doing last year,\n",
            "[00:57:54,940 --> 00:57:57,940]  and do you expect these growth rates to continue?\n",
            "[00:57:57,940 --> 00:58:01,940]  Well, in the enterprise business group,\n",
            "[00:58:01,940 --> 00:58:06,940]  we have focused on the solution for enterprise,\n",

            "[00:58:08,940 --> 00:58:13,940]  This is the reason why we have seen major improvements in our EBITDA\n",
            "[00:58:13,940 --> 00:58:17,940]  and the growth in the revenue in the EBG.\n",
            "[00:58:17,940 --> 00:58:24,990]  And I think this trend will continue for the foreseeable future.\n",

            "[00:58:36,540 --> 00:58:39,540]  One is how many base stations, 3G base stations do you have,\n",
            "[00:58:39,540 --> 00:58:40,540]  if you can disclose?\n",
            "[00:58:40,540 --> 00:58:43,540]  And second, just to double confirm,\n",
            "[00:58:43,540 --> 00:59:03,160]  all the 4G spectrum will expire in the year 2030.\n",
            "[00:59:03,160 --> 00:59:07,160]  We have over 10,000 3G base stations.\n",
            "[00:59:07,160 --> 00:59:17,280]  The license will end for 4G around 2030.\n",

            "[00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:12,380]  First on the mobile business, on a life-for-life basis with our peers,\n",
            "[00:01:12,380 --> 00:01:21,500]  Taiwan Mobile's mobile service revenue in the second quarter was up almost 1 billion, or 7% year-on-year,\n",
            "[00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:23,500]  the highest among the big three.\n",
            "[00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:32,780]  This is credit to the healthy growth momentum in mobile data and accelerating decline in voice revenue.\n",
            "[00:01:32,780 --> 00:01:37,780]  Regarding our smartphone strategy, apart from the 20 exclusive smartphone models,\n",
            "[00:01:37,780 --> 00:01:43,900]  we also have around 52 smartphone tablets products on the market.\n",
            "[00:01:43,900 --> 00:01:47,900]  Besides several exclusive high-end smartphones from leading vendors,\n",
            "[00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:53,900]  we recently added several mid- to low-range on-brand products,\n",
            "[00:01:53,900 --> 00:01:57,900]  amazing A1 to A6 shown in the chart.\n",
            "[00:01:57,900 --> 00:02:02,900]  In the second quarter, smartphone sales volume was up 47% from a year ago\n",
            "[00:02:02,900 --> 00:02:06,900]  and accounted for 86% of total handsets sold.\n",
            "[00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:14,930]  Therefore, mobile data adoption rate went up to 48% of the post-pay install basis from 34% a year ago.\n",
            "[00:02:14,930 --> 00:02:19,930]  This led to a 41% worldwide growth in mobile data revenue in the second quarter.\n",
            "[00:02:19,930 --> 00:02:26,920]  As indicated in the table, our Internet subscriber base increased of 8%\n",
            "[00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:30,920]  and DTV customer base growth of 58%\n",

            "[00:03:08,020 --> 00:03:15,020]  EBITDA of $7.8 billion and EPS of $1.47.\n",
            "[00:03:16,020 --> 00:03:24,060]  In the second quarter, our telecom service revenue showed a 2% year-on-year increase\n",
            "[00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:29,060]  versus a 4% YOI reduction in telecom cash cost.\n",
            "[00:03:29,060 --> 00:03:33,090]  Therefore, telecom service profit increased.\n",
            "[00:03:33,090 --> 00:03:40,090]  In the second quarter, handset subsidies remained relatively fresh YOI\n",
            "[00:03:40,090 --> 00:03:48,090]  because the handset sales revenue and its cost increased by a similar magnitude\n",
            "[00:03:48,090 --> 00:03:51,120]  from the second quarter of last year.\n",
            "[00:03:51,120 --> 00:04:01,150]  The main OPEX increase was due to adding 108 more company stores from a year ago.\n",
            "[00:04:01,150 --> 00:04:08,150]  CBG, EBG, HBG and MoMo all had healthy revenue growth.\n",
            "[00:04:08,150 --> 00:04:14,150]  This led to a 2% YOI increase in EBITDA in the quarter\n",
            "[00:04:14,150 --> 00:04:21,150]  versus a 2% YOI EBITDA drop in the first quarter of this year.\n",

            "[00:04:27,150 --> 00:04:33,150]  Having said that, accumulated consolidated net income for the first half\n",
            "[00:04:33,150 --> 00:04:36,380]  was still ahead of our guidance.\n",
            "[00:04:36,380 --> 00:04:40,380]  Please turn to the next page for divisional performance.\n",
            "[00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:46,920]  CBG's revenue growth rate accelerated to 10% in the second quarter\n",
            "[00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:50,920]  compared to 5% in the first quarter.\n",
            "[00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:56,920]  Therefore, CBG's second quarter top-line growth more than offset\n",
            "[00:04:56,920 --> 00:05:03,920]  expense increase related to handset subsidies, 3G base station increases\n",
            "[00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:05,920]  and new store openings.\n",
            "[00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:12,140]  This helped CBG EBITDA to grow 1% YOI in the second quarter,\n",
            "[00:05:12,140 --> 00:05:17,140]  improved from a 3% EBITDA drop in the first quarter.\n",
            "[00:05:17,140 --> 00:05:25,180]  EBG's second quarter EBITDA YOI growth largely resulted from mobile business growth\n",
            "[00:05:25,180 --> 00:05:30,340]  coupled with stable cost and expenses.\n",
            "[00:05:30,340 --> 00:05:37,340]  HBG has been benefiting from operating leverage and reported a YOI EBITDA growth\n",
            "[00:05:37,340 --> 00:05:44,500]  in contrast to a 39% YOI drop in its first quarter EBITDA.\n",
            "[00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:50,590]  Momo's second quarter EBITDA delivered a 30% YOI jump,\n",
            "[00:05:50,590 --> 00:05:55,590]  boosted not only by a revenue increase but also by margin expansion\n",
            "[00:05:55,590 --> 00:05:59,590]  in both the online and TV home shopping business.\n",
            "[00:05:59,590 --> 00:06:05,820]  Let me turn the presentation over to Rosie for balance sheet and cash flow analysis.\n",
            "[00:06:05,820 --> 00:06:09,810]  Okay, let's turn to balance sheet.\n",
            "[00:06:09,810 --> 00:06:16,350]  In the second quarter, cash balance rose quarter-on-quarter due to higher operating\n",
            "[00:06:16,350 --> 00:06:22,350]  cash inflows resulting from a rise in accounts payable and a decrease in inventory.\n",
            "[00:06:22,350 --> 00:06:28,350]  Compared to a year ago, second quarter cash level was higher mainly due to\n",
            "[00:06:28,350 --> 00:06:32,020]  the new straight bond issue.\n",
            "[00:06:32,020 --> 00:06:37,020]  The year-on-year increase in accounts receivable mainly reflected the expanded\n",
            "[00:06:37,020 --> 00:06:42,310]  bundled handset sales and mobile service revenue.\n",
            "[00:06:42,310 --> 00:06:48,310]  The inventory level rose year-on-year due to more smartphone procurement.\n",
            "[00:06:48,310 --> 00:06:52,600]  The quarter-on-quarter increase in other current liabilities was due to the\n",
            "[00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:59,600]  $0.3 billion payable of cash returns from legal reserves and the $14.5 billion\n",

            "[00:07:21,180 --> 00:07:30,550]  Net debt was only 16% of equity and accounted for 27% of full-year EBITDA.\n",
            "[00:07:30,550 --> 00:07:33,550]  Now let's turn to cash flow analysis.\n",
            "[00:07:33,550 --> 00:07:40,540]  Our operating cash inflow increased sequentially due to a rise in accounts\n",
            "[00:07:40,540 --> 00:07:43,540]  payable and a decrease in inventory.\n",
            "[00:07:43,540 --> 00:07:48,580]  The investing cash outflow rose year-on-year because of higher mobile\n",

            "[00:08:24,410 --> 00:08:29,410]  Second quarter financing cash inflows increased both quarter-on-quarter and\n",
            "[00:08:29,410 --> 00:08:34,410]  year-on-year due to the issuance of a corporate bond in the quarter.\n",
            "[00:08:34,410 --> 00:08:44,410]  The net inflow of NT$2.89 billion was mainly a combination of $2.65 billion\n",

            "[00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:29,820]  As expected, we achieved our goals for the first half and have recently completed\n",

            "[00:10:14,220 --> 00:10:16,220]  I have four questions.\n",
            "[00:10:16,220 --> 00:10:19,220]  The first one is regarding the results.\n",
            "[00:10:19,220 --> 00:10:22,220]  I understand that you have achieved EBITDA and Net Profit ahead of your\n",
            "[00:10:22,220 --> 00:10:23,220]  guidance.\n",
            "[00:10:23,220 --> 00:10:26,220]  I just want to understand a little bit better, what do you think is the key\n",
            "[00:10:26,220 --> 00:10:30,220]  driver behind this set of results that allow you to actually beat the guidance?\n",
            "[00:10:30,220 --> 00:10:33,220]  Basically, what turned out better than you expected?\n",
            "[00:10:33,220 --> 00:10:34,220]  Is it revenue?\n",
            "[00:10:34,220 --> 00:10:35,220]  Is it cost?\n",
            "[00:10:35,220 --> 00:10:37,220]  Or just the timing of some cost items?\n",
            "[00:10:37,220 --> 00:10:39,220]  The second question is regarding the fixed line.\n",
            "[00:10:39,220 --> 00:10:42,220]  I understand the fixed line revenue is coming down quite materially in the\n",
            "[00:10:42,220 --> 00:10:43,220]  first half.\n",
            "[00:10:43,220 --> 00:10:47,220]  We discussed this a little bit before, but maybe you can update us on how the\n",

            "[00:11:05,220 --> 00:11:07,220]  contribute to you more materially?\n",
            "[00:11:07,220 --> 00:11:09,220]  And the last question is regarding Momo.\n",
            "[00:11:10,220 --> 00:11:14,220]  It's quite encouraging to see Momo start to turn around, but do you see a\n",
            "[00:11:14,220 --> 00:11:18,220]  significant turnaround this year for the operation yet or it would still take\n",
            "[00:11:18,220 --> 00:11:22,220]  quite some time for it to actually turn around more materially?\n",
            "[00:11:22,220 --> 00:11:33,670]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:11:33,670 --> 00:11:37,670]  For the first question, I think the revenue of the second quarter is better\n",
            "[00:11:37,670 --> 00:11:39,670]  than we expected.\n",
            "[00:11:40,670 --> 00:11:47,670]  At the same time, the expense is lower than what we have projected.\n",
            "[00:11:47,670 --> 00:11:56,670]  As you know, the high-end smartphone sales is not as high as we expected.\n",
            "[00:11:56,670 --> 00:12:03,670]  Originally, people expected the HTC One and the S4 would sell better, but it\n",
            "[00:12:03,670 --> 00:12:07,670]  turned out it doesn't generate that kind of sales revenue.\n",
            "[00:12:08,670 --> 00:12:11,670]  The expense item is lower.\n",
            "[00:12:11,670 --> 00:12:14,670]  In the meantime, the revenue is higher.\n",
            "[00:12:14,670 --> 00:12:18,670]  It turned out that we bid our second quarter guidance.\n",
            "[00:12:18,670 --> 00:12:21,670]  That's the reason for it.\n",
            "[00:12:21,670 --> 00:12:27,670]  As for the fixed line business, we tend to look at the fixed line business as a\n",
            "[00:12:27,670 --> 00:12:29,670]  legacy business.\n",
            "[00:12:29,670 --> 00:12:36,670]  We try to focus to provide a complete solution to our enterprise customers and\n",
            "[00:12:36,670 --> 00:12:43,670]  focusing on providing a mobility solution instead of simply a fixed line solution.\n",
            "[00:12:43,670 --> 00:12:52,670]  Therefore, we have emphasized to sell only fixed line service to our enterprise\n",

            "[00:12:53,670 --> 00:13:01,670]  Therefore, you can see that this slows down our revenue or drops our revenue in\n",
            "[00:13:01,670 --> 00:13:03,670]  our fixed line business.\n",
            "[00:13:03,670 --> 00:13:10,670]  In the meantime, our enterprise mobile service revenue is increasing so that you\n",
            "[00:13:10,670 --> 00:13:16,670]  can see that it contributes positively in the EBITDA in our enterprise business\n",
            "[00:13:16,670 --> 00:13:18,670]  unit.\n",
            "[00:13:18,670 --> 00:13:22,670]  As for mCommerce, we launched mCommerce.\n",
            "[00:13:22,670 --> 00:13:32,670]  We are still testing the water and most likely more significant results will show\n",

            "[00:13:47,670 --> 00:13:51,670]  We see they are moving into the right direction.\n",
            "[00:13:51,670 --> 00:13:59,670]  We would expect that the performance will be better in the future.\n",

            "[00:14:02,180 --> 00:14:05,180]  Just a follow-up on the first question.\n",
            "[00:14:05,180 --> 00:14:10,180]  It's because of the lower than expected smartphone sales on the higher end side,\n",

            "[00:14:12,180 --> 00:14:18,180]  Is it fair to say that the key rigs to achieving the guidance or to surpassing the\n",
            "[00:14:18,180 --> 00:14:22,180]  guidance would be whether in the second half that would be popular high-end\n",
            "[00:14:22,180 --> 00:14:25,180]  smartphones that could come and hit the market?\n",
            "[00:14:25,180 --> 00:14:28,180]  If that does not happen, then it's very likely that you surpass the overall\n",
            "[00:14:28,180 --> 00:14:42,410]  guidance for the full year.\n",
            "[00:14:42,410 --> 00:14:51,410]  It's very hard to say in the second half because, as you know, there are several\n",
            "[00:14:51,410 --> 00:14:54,410]  factors that may affect the second half.\n",
            "[00:14:54,410 --> 00:15:00,410]  For instance, in the market, the rumors say that Apple is going to introduce the\n",
            "[00:15:00,410 --> 00:15:07,410]  low-cost iPhone, and last year we didn't project that you have this low-cost\n",
            "[00:15:07,410 --> 00:15:09,410]  iPhone.\n",
            "[00:15:09,410 --> 00:15:14,410]  So if the low-cost iPhone gets into the market, I think it's going to generate\n",
            "[00:15:14,410 --> 00:15:16,410]  significant sales.\n",
            "[00:15:16,410 --> 00:15:22,410]  Plus, it's not clear at the moment what kind of specification you have for\n",
            "[00:15:22,410 --> 00:15:24,410]  iPhone 5S.\n",
            "[00:15:24,410 --> 00:15:31,410]  If the iPhone 5 turns out to be a larger screen, it tends to drive more sales.\n",
            "[00:15:31,410 --> 00:15:39,410]  So even though we did our forecast in the first half, but we have to be very\n",
            "[00:15:39,410 --> 00:15:45,410]  cautious about the outlook for the second half because the Apple potentially can\n",
            "[00:15:45,410 --> 00:15:50,410]  be a wild factor in the second half forecast.\n",
            "[00:15:53,230 --> 00:15:54,230]  Well noted and very clear.\n",

            "[00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:13,120]  One, you've completed the spin-off of the handset stores, so I guess it's now\n",
            "[00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:16,120]  sitting in 100% subsidiary.\n",
            "[00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:19,120]  What impact do you see that as having on the business model?\n",
            "[00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:23,120]  And second, what are the next steps towards this particular initiative now that\n",
            "[00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:26,120]  the spin-off is done for the next 12 months that you can share with us?\n",
            "[00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:28,120]  So that's question one.\n",
            "[00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:34,120]  Question two, on to 4G spectrum auction, given the various, I guess, frequency\n",
            "[00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:39,120]  lots on offer, how should we be thinking about, and I'm guessing to the extent\n",
            "[00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:44,120]  you can share with us, how should we be thinking about Tawan Mobile approaching\n",
            "[00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:46,120]  this spectrum auction?\n",
            "[00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:49,120]  To the extent that you can share your thoughts with us, anything would be very\n",
            "[00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:50,120]  useful.\n",
            "[00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:51,120]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:16:52,980 --> 00:16:54,980]  Could you please repeat your first question?\n",
            "[00:16:54,980 --> 00:16:56,980]  We can't hear you clearly.\n",
            "[00:16:56,980 --> 00:16:58,980]  Sure, I will.\n",
            "[00:16:58,980 --> 00:17:04,980]  You have completed the spin-off of the direct stores.\n",
            "[00:17:04,980 --> 00:17:09,980]  What is the impact from this to the business model at all, and is there a next\n",
            "[00:17:09,980 --> 00:17:14,980]  step after the spin-off that we should be expecting in the next 12 months?\n",
            "[00:17:14,980 --> 00:17:22,170]  Well, the spin-off really doesn't affect the business model.\n",
            "[00:17:22,170 --> 00:17:30,480]  So we expect the business as usual for the next 12 months.\n",
            "[00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:35,340]  It is a wholly owned subsidiary of Tawan Mobile.\n",
            "[00:17:35,340 --> 00:17:40,340]  And on your second question of 4G auction, I think at this point in time we\n",
            "[00:17:40,340 --> 00:17:44,340]  cannot share with you any of our thoughts.\n",
            "[00:17:44,340 --> 00:17:47,980]  Understood.\n",
            "[00:17:47,980 --> 00:17:50,980]  So what was the motive behind the spin-off?\n",
            "[00:17:50,980 --> 00:17:57,120]  I mean, I guess, why did you do it then, if I could check?\n",
            "[00:17:57,120 --> 00:18:05,980]  Well, the direct store has a very different business model.\n",
            "[00:18:05,980 --> 00:18:08,980]  It's a retail business model.\n",
            "[00:18:08,980 --> 00:18:11,980]  It has a lot of employees.\n",
            "[00:18:11,980 --> 00:18:18,980]  So the organization structure, the promotion system, the salary system, a lot\n",
            "[00:18:18,980 --> 00:18:23,980]  of things are very different from a traditional telco.\n",
            "[00:18:23,980 --> 00:18:30,980]  So we think it's better for them to be spin-off so that they can establish a\n",
            "[00:18:30,980 --> 00:18:36,980]  truly retail business structure and system.\n",
            "[00:18:36,980 --> 00:18:40,980]  So that's the main purpose for the spin-off.\n",
            "[00:18:40,980 --> 00:18:41,980]  Okay.\n",
            "[00:18:41,980 --> 00:18:44,980]  Would you be thinking of doing something else with it, maybe listing it or\n",
            "[00:18:44,980 --> 00:18:48,980]  letting it spread off into other retail operations over the next 12 months?\n",
            "[00:18:48,980 --> 00:18:54,980]  Well, I think it's too far for us to think about this because up to now it's\n",
            "[00:18:54,980 --> 00:18:57,980]  still 100% owned subsidiary.\n",
            "[00:18:57,980 --> 00:19:04,980]  So I think it would be very far off for us to think at this moment because the\n",
            "[00:19:04,980 --> 00:19:10,980]  focus right now is really doing a lot of sales for Tawan Mobile.\n",
            "[00:19:10,980 --> 00:19:17,980]  So we tend to think that it needs to be 100% owned by Tawan Mobile.\n",
            "[00:19:17,980 --> 00:19:20,100]  Thank you so much.\n",
            "[00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:24,580]  And if I don't see you before the auctions, best of luck.\n",

            "[00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:54,480]  So I have mainly two sets of questions.\n",
            "[00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:56,480]  One is on your cable TV business.\n",
            "[00:19:56,480 --> 00:20:00,480]  So we noticed that recently there are a lot of the regulatory changes regarding\n",
            "[00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:08,480]  introducing rezoning policy as well as encouraging digitalization,\n",
            "[00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:11,480]  potentially to introduce tier pricing.\n",
            "[00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:17,480]  So it seems like the policy trend is to introduce competition in the longer\n",
            "[00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:22,480]  term to benefit consumer by lowering the price and also to encourage\n",
            "[00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:24,480]  operators to spend more capex.\n",
            "[00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:29,480]  So I'm just wondering what's your thought strategy in response to these policy\n",
            "[00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:32,660]  trends.\n",
            "[00:20:32,660 --> 00:20:34,660]  So this is my first set of questions.\n",
            "[00:20:34,660 --> 00:20:39,660]  Maybe I'll ask the questions later after you reply to these.\n",
            "[00:20:39,660 --> 00:20:41,890]  Thanks.\n",
            "[00:20:41,890 --> 00:20:48,890]  Well, certainly there are a lot of regulations regarding the cable TV business.\n",
            "[00:20:48,890 --> 00:20:53,890]  And as you said, these are rezoning.\n",
            "[00:20:53,890 --> 00:20:58,890]  So we are also thinking about whether we should enter the other markets.\n",
            "[00:20:58,890 --> 00:21:01,890]  So we are under consideration.\n",
            "[00:21:01,890 --> 00:21:08,500]  Secondly is that the digital TV, we are pushing digital TV strongly.\n",
            "[00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:15,500]  And currently the digital TV penetration in our area is more than 20%.\n",
            "[00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:20,500]  So we hopefully by the end of the next year we can push to 40% or 50%.\n",
            "[00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:26,500]  So the digital TV is our strategy.\n",
            "[00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:34,500]  So really the intervention or the instruction by MCC really doesn't affect\n",
            "[00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:42,500]  our business because it's within our strategy to push the digital TV.\n",
            "[00:21:43,500 --> 00:22:01,720]  As for whether the sharing of the program is an issue, from what we see, the\n",

            "[00:34:29,730 --> 00:34:33,730]  can you go over some of the targets in terms of the market?\n",
            "[00:34:33,730 --> 00:34:36,730]  Because you did talk about looking more at the middle and low-end.\n",
            "[00:34:36,730 --> 00:34:39,730]  Can you just discuss a little bit about your Super Saver plan\n",
            "[00:34:39,730 --> 00:34:43,730]  and particularly what market segment you're targeting?\n",
            "[00:34:43,730 --> 00:34:47,730]  It does seem similar in ways to Chonghua Telecom's recent package,\n",

            "[00:34:49,730 --> 00:34:52,730]  so I'm just interested in what you're doing on that front.\n",
            "[00:34:52,730 --> 00:34:56,730]  And then the second question is on the direct stores.\n",
            "[00:34:56,730 --> 00:34:59,730]  What is your plan at the moment for the China market?\n",
            "[00:34:59,730 --> 00:35:02,730]  I do believe there's some discussion about you wanting to expand\n",
            "[00:35:02,730 --> 00:35:04,730]  into that area as well.\n",
            "[00:35:04,730 --> 00:35:05,730]  Thanks.\n",
            "[00:35:07,890 --> 00:35:13,180]  As you know, even though we try very hard,\n",
            "[00:35:13,180 --> 00:35:17,180]  but there are still 50% of users who do not use smartphones.\n",
            "[00:35:17,180 --> 00:35:22,180]  And most of these users are really middle-end and low-end subscribers.\n",
            "[00:35:22,180 --> 00:35:26,180]  So our focus is really to penetrate that market,\n",
            "[00:35:26,180 --> 00:35:29,180]  because if you don't penetrate that market,\n",
            "[00:35:29,180 --> 00:35:33,180]  then the 2G service will last forever.\n",
            "[00:35:33,180 --> 00:35:38,180]  So the intention is that once we introduce the 4G,\n",
            "[00:35:38,180 --> 00:35:42,180]  we try to de-emphasize on the 2G network.\n",
            "[00:35:42,180 --> 00:35:47,180]  Therefore, we will try to migrate users from 2G to 3G.\n",
            "[00:35:47,180 --> 00:35:50,180]  In order to migrate from 2G to 3G,\n",
            "[00:35:50,180 --> 00:35:53,180]  the most important thing is the mobile Internet.\n",
            "[00:35:53,180 --> 00:35:59,180]  And these customers tend to be low-end,\n",
            "[00:35:59,180 --> 00:36:02,180]  so the phone needs to be inexpensive.\n",
            "[00:36:02,180 --> 00:36:05,180]  That's why we introduced the A1 to A6.\n",
            "[00:36:05,180 --> 00:36:11,180]  The A3 model costs only less than 2,000 NT without bundle package.\n",
            "[00:36:12,180 --> 00:36:18,180]  And in the meantime, these customers need a data package,\n",
            "[00:36:18,180 --> 00:36:21,180]  but they don't really need an all-you-can-eat\n",
            "[00:36:21,180 --> 00:36:24,180]  because it's too expensive for them.\n",
            "[00:36:24,180 --> 00:36:28,180]  So they are casual users on mobile Internet.\n",
            "[00:36:28,180 --> 00:36:31,180]  So our focus is trying to penetrate that segment\n",
            "[00:36:31,180 --> 00:36:36,180]  and try to move the 2G subscribers to 3G.\n",

            "[00:36:39,180 --> 00:36:47,460]  And as for DirectSource, we are still talking with China,\n",
            "[00:36:47,460 --> 00:36:53,460]  and we are very cautious.\n",
            "[00:36:53,460 --> 00:36:57,460]  Maybe something will happen, but at this moment,\n",
            "[00:36:57,460 --> 00:37:05,460]  we haven't made a firm decision regarding our China,\n",
            "[00:37:05,460 --> 00:37:09,460]  when should we enter China,\n",
            "[00:37:09,460 --> 00:37:15,460]  because the economic situation in China is not at the best moment.\n",
            "[00:37:15,460 --> 00:37:21,460]  The retail, the real estate rent rate is very high,\n",
            "[00:37:21,460 --> 00:37:25,460]  and the economic situation is not very good.\n",
            "[00:37:25,460 --> 00:37:33,200]  So we are very cautious regarding when is the best time for us to enter the market.\n",

            "[00:37:34,200 --> 00:37:37,200]  Just a follow-up when you were talking about the mid- to low-end.\n",
            "[00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:40,200]  Is there a certain demographic?\n",
            "[00:37:40,200 --> 00:37:45,200]  Are you finding that this is particularly your older generation users\n",
            "[00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:48,200]  are particularly the ones that are more reluctant to move forward?\n",
            "[00:37:48,200 --> 00:37:50,200]  I would assume that, maybe wrongly,\n",
            "[00:37:50,200 --> 00:37:55,200]  but I would assume that mostly the teenager group would have already adopted this.\n",
            "[00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:57,200]  I'm just wondering what the age dynamics you're looking at as well.\n",
            "[00:37:57,200 --> 00:37:58,200]  Okay.\n",
            "[00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:03,200]  For those people who are over 50 years old,\n",
            "[00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:07,200]  and they reside in the central or southern region,\n",
            "[00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:09,200]  especially in the southern region,\n",
            "[00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:14,200]  you still have a lot of users that don't use smartphones.\n",
            "[00:38:14,200 --> 00:38:23,470]  And the purchasing power of these people are not very high.\n",
            "[00:38:23,470 --> 00:38:24,470]  Okay.\n",
            "[00:38:24,470 --> 00:38:27,470]  So I would assume marketing plans would be focused in those areas as well\n",
            "[00:38:27,470 --> 00:38:31,470]  to try to get those users on board.\n",

            "[00:38:40,420 --> 00:38:41,650]  Hi.\n",
            "[00:38:41,650 --> 00:38:43,650]  Thank you for the opportunity to ask a question.\n",
            "[00:38:43,650 --> 00:38:50,650]  I just have one question following up on the recent question on mobile service revenue.\n",
            "[00:38:51,650 --> 00:38:56,650]  You mentioned that the voice revenue decline has been better than your competitors,\n",
            "[00:38:56,650 --> 00:39:01,650]  and also data revenue growth has also accelerated during the quarter.\n",
            "[00:39:01,650 --> 00:39:05,650]  Can I know what's the driver behind the difference in performance\n",
            "[00:39:05,650 --> 00:39:10,650]  between Tao Mobile and your peers on the voice revenue part?\n",
            "[00:39:10,650 --> 00:39:11,650]  And also on data revenue,\n",
            "[00:39:11,650 --> 00:39:16,650]  do you expect further acceleration in growth in coming quarters,\n",
            "[00:39:16,650 --> 00:39:20,650]  given the penetration of mobile data is already at around 40 percent?\n",
            "[00:39:20,650 --> 00:39:27,780]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:39:27,780 --> 00:39:40,780]  I think our strategy at the moment is that we try to focus on not so much acquisition.\n",
            "[00:39:40,780 --> 00:39:49,780]  We focus more on to acquire real users, a user who can contribute\n",
            "[00:39:49,780 --> 00:39:53,780]  to our contributing revenue.\n",
            "[00:39:53,780 --> 00:39:55,780]  So that's our focus.\n",
            "[00:39:55,780 --> 00:39:59,780]  Instead of acquisition, peer subscriber member,\n",
            "[00:39:59,780 --> 00:40:04,780]  we focus on acquiring a customer with voice revenue and also data revenue.\n",
            "[00:40:04,780 --> 00:40:11,780]  That's a strategy which is maybe a little different from our competitors.\n",
            "[00:40:11,780 --> 00:40:16,780]  Secondly, because the penetration of data is so high,\n",
            "[00:40:16,780 --> 00:40:21,780]  so you have a lot of repeated subscribers.\n",
            "[00:40:21,780 --> 00:40:28,780]  Therefore, the growth rate of data revenue is not easy to maintain.\n",
            "[00:40:28,780 --> 00:40:36,780]  This is part of the reason we try to penetrate the middle and low-end segments\n",
            "[00:40:36,780 --> 00:40:38,780]  because for high-end segments,\n",
            "[00:40:38,780 --> 00:40:45,780]  most likely a lot of the sales are really to the repeated subscribers.\n",
            "[00:40:45,780 --> 00:40:48,780]  They have subscribed to your data service revenue already.\n",
            "[00:40:48,780 --> 00:40:53,780]  So in order to maintain a better growth rate in the data,\n",
            "[00:40:53,780 --> 00:40:58,780]  you really have to penetrate the middle-end and low-end sector.\n",
            "[00:40:58,780 --> 00:41:06,780]  If we are successful, then I think we still can maintain the growth rate.\n",
            "[00:41:06,780 --> 00:41:10,880]  Right.\n",
            "[00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:12,880]  And just one follow-up question.\n",
            "[00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:15,880]  Right now for your mobile data users,\n",
            "[00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:23,300]  how many of them are using the highest tiered unlimited data plan?\n",
            "[00:41:23,300 --> 00:41:28,160]  More than 70%.\n",
            "[00:41:28,160 --> 00:41:32,050]  Okay. Thank you.\n",
            "[00:41:32,050 --> 00:41:33,050]  Thank you.\n",

            "[00:41:37,530 --> 00:41:38,530]  Hi.\n",
            "[00:41:38,530 --> 00:41:43,530]  I just have one follow-up question regarding the potential introduction of tier pricing\n",
            "[00:41:43,530 --> 00:41:45,530]  after you launch 4G.\n",
            "[00:41:45,530 --> 00:41:49,530]  Do you think that there would be an opportunity for you to remove it on 3G as well?\n",
            "[00:41:49,530 --> 00:41:55,530]  Or the removal of that or the introduction of tier pricing would be just mainly on 4G services?\n",
            "[00:41:55,530 --> 00:41:56,530]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:41:56,530 --> 00:42:02,520]  I think the tier pricing is mainly for 4G.\n",
            "[00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:03,520]  Thank you very much.\n",
            "[00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:06,520]  It wouldn't allow us to change the pricing in 3G.\n",
            "[00:42:06,520 --> 00:42:11,780]  Thank you.\n",

            "[00:42:28,670 --> 00:42:30,670]  Yeah, I just had one question, please.\n",
            "[00:42:30,670 --> 00:42:35,670]  Just your talk about moving to the mid and lowest segment of the market or consumers.\n",
            "[00:42:35,670 --> 00:42:39,670]  I just wonder if you can talk a bit about the profitability of those consumers relative to the high end,\n",
            "[00:42:39,670 --> 00:42:43,670]  obviously lower subsidies, but obviously they've got lower ARPUs as well.\n",
            "[00:42:43,670 --> 00:42:46,670]  So I was wondering if you look at sort of EBITDA margins,\n",
            "[00:42:46,670 --> 00:42:49,670]  how does that impact your margin as you go forward\n",
            "[00:42:49,670 --> 00:42:52,670]  and they contribute a bigger proportion of revenues?\n",
            "[00:42:52,670 --> 00:42:58,900]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:42:58,900 --> 00:43:02,900]  Actually, the low end subscriber may not.\n",
            "[00:43:02,900 --> 00:43:08,900]  The EBITDA margin may not be so bad because the subsidy level is not so high,\n",

            "[00:45:03,530 --> 00:45:06,530]  and now you're just trying to, you know,\n",

            "[00:45:47,300 --> 00:45:50,300]  but also you need to have a smartphone package.\n",
            "[00:45:50,300 --> 00:45:58,300]  And the only way to reduce your cost of the smartphone\n",

            "[00:46:00,300 --> 00:46:10,300]  because currently like branded vendors like Samsung, Sony, or LG, or HTC,\n",

            "[00:46:30,500 --> 00:46:37,500]  So are you actually more partnering with like the mainland vendors\n",

            "[00:46:40,590 --> 00:46:43,590]  Well, we have mainland manufacturers.\n",

            "[00:46:51,090 --> 00:46:56,090]  My second question is related to the 4G license.\n",
            "[00:46:56,090 --> 00:47:00,090]  I know you probably can't talk too much about it on the license auction,\n",
            "[00:47:00,090 --> 00:47:02,090]  but would you comment on the new entrance?\n",

            "[00:47:12,090 --> 00:47:15,090]  in terms of so many new entrants coming to the 4G\n",
            "[00:47:15,090 --> 00:47:19,090]  and whether they are going to launch more disruptive data plans\n",
            "[00:47:19,090 --> 00:47:22,950]  or marketing campaigns?\n",
            "[00:47:22,950 --> 00:47:28,950]  Well, it's really hard to comment, but I think God bless them.\n",

            "[00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:19,930]  despite revenue pressure from the lower cable TV subscription fees.\n",
            "[00:03:19,930 --> 00:03:24,930]  Please turn to the next page, which is show our new products and services.\n",
            "[00:03:24,930 --> 00:03:32,930]  This page of new products and services, what we have launched during the first quarter, is for your reference.\n",
            "[00:03:32,930 --> 00:03:37,930]  I will turn the mic to Vivian on our financial results.\n",
            "[00:03:37,930 --> 00:03:42,930]  Please turn to the page 9 of our financial results summary.\n",
            "[00:03:42,930 --> 00:03:49,930]  In the first quarter, there were three revenue streams, including wireless data revenue up 30%,\n",
            "[00:03:49,930 --> 00:03:58,930]  mobile handset sales rose 22%, and online shopping grew 64%.\n",
            "[00:03:58,930 --> 00:04:08,930]  We know that IFIs and the fail value method regarding bundle sales have been applied starting year 2013.\n",
            "[00:04:08,930 --> 00:04:17,930]  In the first quarter, bundle sales revenue adjustments were $143 million less than a year ago.\n",
            "[00:04:17,930 --> 00:04:23,930]  If the above-mentioned adjustments have been included,\n",
            "[00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:32,930]  the first quarter telecom service revenue and telecom EBITDA both would have actually grown by 2% YOY.\n",
            "[00:04:32,930 --> 00:04:38,930]  Compared to our first quarter data net, our telecom service revenue met the target.\n",
            "[00:04:38,930 --> 00:04:43,930]  Although we failed to meet our aggressive handset sales target,\n",
            "[00:04:43,930 --> 00:04:51,930]  we still managed to generate better-than-expected profits from the handset sales business in the quarter.\n",
            "[00:04:51,930 --> 00:04:56,930]  Therefore, our EBITDA was ahead of our first quarter forecast.\n",
            "[00:04:56,930 --> 00:05:05,930]  Asset write-off losses came in larger than expected in the first quarter as we pulled in some of the write-off schedules.\n",
            "[00:05:05,930 --> 00:05:12,930]  Having said that, consolidated net income reached 108% of our guideline.\n",
            "[00:05:12,930 --> 00:05:16,930]  Please turn to the page of divisional performance.\n",
            "[00:05:16,930 --> 00:05:24,930]  Our healthy revenue YOY growth more than the increase in the smartphone bundle sales cost\n",
            "[00:05:24,930 --> 00:05:29,930]  and their related marketing activities in the first quarter.\n",
            "[00:05:29,930 --> 00:05:36,930]  The 3% YOY dip in CBG's EBITDA arose from adding more 3G base stations.\n",
            "[00:05:36,930 --> 00:05:43,930]  EBG's first quarter EBITDA YOY growth largely resulted from expense discipline.\n",
            "[00:05:43,930 --> 00:05:55,930]  Revenue pressure from the lower cable TV subscription fee has been softened by increased revenue due to a higher DTV adoption rate.\n",
            "[00:05:55,930 --> 00:06:02,930]  In addition, HBG continued benefiting from its operating leverage in the first quarter.\n",
            "[00:06:02,930 --> 00:06:13,930]  Momo's EBITDA construction was a reflection of its aggressiveness in gaining market share in the virtual channels.\n",
            "[00:06:13,930 --> 00:06:22,930]  The subscription EBITDA declines in CBG and EBG were consolidated with a lower base of network-related costs\n",
            "[00:06:22,930 --> 00:06:28,930]  as well as a lower telecom service revenue in the first quarter due to seasonality.\n",
            "[00:06:28,930 --> 00:06:35,930]  Let me turn the presentation over to Rosie for balance sheet and cash flow analysis.\n",
            "[00:06:35,930 --> 00:06:44,930]  On the balance sheet analysis, you will see from the table that cash balance was stable compared to a quarter ago.\n",
            "[00:06:44,930 --> 00:06:55,930]  The year-on-year increase in accounts receivable was a reflection of the accumulated net revenue addition for bundle sales under the fair value method.\n",
            "[00:06:55,930 --> 00:07:08,930]  The inventory level also rose both year-on-year basis and quarter-on-quarter basis, which is primarily due to more handset procurement.\n",
            "[00:07:08,930 --> 00:07:15,930]  Unappropriated earnings increased to $7.9 billion from $1.3 billion.\n",
            "[00:07:15,930 --> 00:07:27,930]  The balance set at the end of 2012 under ROC GAAP due to the adjustments adopting IFR as a fair value method starting 2013.\n",
            "[00:07:27,930 --> 00:07:30,930]  Let's turn to cash flow analysis.\n",
            "[00:07:30,930 --> 00:07:41,930]  In the first quarter, operating cash inflow went down due to an increase in accounts receivable and inventory and a decrease in accounts payable.\n",
            "[00:07:42,930 --> 00:08:01,930]  The first quarter cash cutback was up to $3.75 billion, mainly due to the $2.1 billion payments of IDC construction costs made in the first quarter this year, which was delayed from 2012.\n",
            "[00:08:02,930 --> 00:08:13,930]  In terms of financing activity, the next cash inflow of a quarter of a billion was due to an increase in short-term borrowing.\n",
            "[00:08:13,930 --> 00:08:28,930]  In addition, as you might be aware of, five-year $5.8 billion of straight bonds was issued with a coupon rate of 1.29 percent.\n",
            "[00:08:29,930 --> 00:08:47,930]  In late April, with the spike in cash cutbacks related to the new IDC, pre-cash flow came in at $0.19 billion, which is lower than a year ago.\n",
            "[00:08:47,930 --> 00:08:53,930]  I'll turn the mic back to Vivian for event updates and key messages.\n",
            "[00:08:54,930 --> 00:08:58,930]  As you can see from the upper portion of the event update,\n",
            "[00:08:58,930 --> 00:09:13,930]  Taiwan Mobile has approved a proposal to distribute year 2012 dividend and cash return per share of $5.5 NT, pending AGM's approval.\n",
            "[00:09:13,930 --> 00:09:21,930]  Separately, the bottom portion of this slide lists the awards we have recently received for your reference.\n",
            "[00:09:21,930 --> 00:09:25,930]  Please turn to the next page for the key messages.\n",
            "[00:09:25,930 --> 00:09:31,930]  To wrap up our presentation, the slides summarize the key messages that we would like to deliver.\n",
            "[00:09:31,930 --> 00:09:44,930]  Our efforts in committing resources over a wider range of areas continue to pay off as reflected in the 2% YOY EBITDA growth of the telecom business.\n",
            "[00:09:44,930 --> 00:09:57,930]  When compared to our peers on a like-for-like basis, we will continue our endeavors to strengthen our market position and are confident in achieving our goals for the year.\n",
            "[00:09:57,930 --> 00:10:01,930]  Okay, we open the floor for the questions and answers. Thank you.\n",
            "[00:10:04,370 --> 00:10:07,370]  Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, we will now pull for questions.\n",
            "[00:10:07,370 --> 00:10:11,370]  If you would like to register for a question, please press star 1 key now. Thank you.\n",
            "[00:10:12,370 --> 00:10:21,820]  Our first question comes from Chase Ben with Credit Suisse Hong Kong. Please go ahead.\n",
            "[00:10:21,820 --> 00:10:29,980]  Thank you very much for the opportunity to ask the questions. I have three questions in total.\n",
            "[00:10:29,980 --> 00:10:43,980]  The first one is regarding the cable television business. I understand that there is a talk about the new regulations that would come in and regulate basically the cap on the pay TV price over the next few years.\n",
            "[00:10:43,980 --> 00:10:49,980]  Can you elaborate on that and is there any prelim impact on that?\n",
            "[00:10:49,980 --> 00:11:07,980]  The second question is regarding the earnings relative to guidance. I understand that in the first quarter, you are running ahead of your guidance both in terms of the EBITDA and bottom line, notwithstanding the fact that you are actually kind of running behind on the handset sales target.\n",
            "[00:11:08,980 --> 00:11:19,980]  Would you please explain, number one, is there any particular reason why you missed the handset sales target in the first quarter? Are you delaying some launching promotions or something?\n",
            "[00:11:19,980 --> 00:11:28,980]  And also because EBITDA and bottom line are ahead of guidance, is that you think it's a room that your original guidance actually is just too conservative? Thank you.\n",
            "[00:11:29,980 --> 00:11:50,130]  Okay. Regarding the potential tariff cap for cable TV, at this moment, it hasn't been finalized. The NCC is looking for comments from the industry.\n",
            "[00:11:51,130 --> 00:12:07,130]  The cap mainly is tied to the penetration rate of the digital TV. Telemobile has allocated enough KPACs to push for greater digital TV penetration.\n",
            "[00:12:07,130 --> 00:12:21,130]  Currently, our digital TV penetration rate is right on our target. So if we hit the digital TV penetration rate, we wouldn't be impacted by this tariff cap.\n",
            "[00:12:22,130 --> 00:12:42,130]  So to answer your first question, the second question is regarding why our handset sales is below our expectation. There are two reasons. The iPhone 5 was not turned out to be not so strong as we would like to see.\n",
            "[00:12:42,130 --> 00:13:11,130]  Secondly, as you know, the delay of HTC handsets, the high-end handsets, has affected the bundle sales to a certain extent in the first quarter. So mainly two reasons, the delay of HTC Prime handsets and also the slowdown of iPhone 5 created that we couldn't hit our handset sales target.\n",
            "[00:13:12,130 --> 00:13:30,130]  And as for our EPS guidance, we think that we are not conservative. I think there is still a lot of uncertainty in the future because the economy in Taiwan currently is not very transparent.\n",
            "[00:13:30,130 --> 00:13:46,130]  So we will have to wait maybe an additional one or two quarters to see whether there is some room for us to change our guidance.\n",
            "[00:13:47,130 --> 00:13:59,130]  Thank you. Just one follow-up question, if I may, on MOMO actually. So can you update us on the progress of turning around MOMO toward higher growth and improvement in EBITDA margin? Thank you.\n",
            "[00:14:00,130 --> 00:14:26,130]  Actually, MOMO has done extensive review of its operation. We have identified several areas which can improve their operating margin. And I think the MOMO will start implementing these in order to meet the guidance we set up for MOMO to establish this year.\n",
            "[00:14:27,130 --> 00:14:50,130]  So we are quite optimistic regarding whether MOMO can hit this year's budget. Even though in the first quarter, the performance was not up to our expectations, but the management team has taken the necessary measures to address that problem.\n",
            "[00:14:52,130 --> 00:14:53,130]  That is perfect. Thank you.\n",
            "[00:14:54,130 --> 00:14:59,310]  Thank you. Our next question comes from Lucy Liu with JPMorgan Hong Kong. Please go ahead.\n",
            "[00:15:00,310 --> 00:15:13,310]  Hi, thank you. I have a few questions. Firstly, it is still also on cable TV business. So you mentioned that your current digitization progress is on track of your target.\n",
            "[00:15:14,310 --> 00:15:34,310]  So can we have a detailed idea in terms of what the target digitization rate you aim for? And also, it seems like if the government is really pushing for digitization, do you feel that you need to give out more free set-top box to boost this set-top box penetration?\n",
            "[00:15:34,310 --> 00:15:48,310]  So is there any implication in terms of your capex on the cable TV side? Currently, you are guiding for a flattish year-on-year capex for cable TV versus last year. So is there any risk for the capex?\n",
            "[00:15:49,540 --> 00:16:01,540]  Okay. Regarding the target rate, I think by the end of this year, we are going to surpass 100% penetration rate in the digital TV. That's in our budget.\n",
            "[00:16:02,540 --> 00:16:22,540]  And if you recall correctly, in this year, we have allocated enough capex for our cable TV business. So the capex has included a low-end set-top box, which is mainly used to dry up the penetration of the digital TV.\n",
            "[00:16:23,540 --> 00:16:41,540]  So that capex, that expense is included in the cable TV budget this year. So there won't be an increase in the capex for HPG this year. And even without this increase of capex, we still can hit the original target we set.\n",
            "[00:16:42,540 --> 00:17:01,540]  Sure. So just to clarify, so with $900 million allocated for this year, you already reached your 100% penetration by the end of next year, right? So meaning that next year, you still spend another $900 million. Then you can 100% penetrate for set-top box. Am I correct?\n",
            "[00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:05,040]  Could you please repeat your question?\n",
            "[00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:12,040]  No, I mean your target is to reach 100% set-top box penetration by the end of this year.\n",
            "[00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:18,520]  No. There's no way we can hit 100%.\n",
            "[00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:20,520]  Oh, okay. Sorry. What's the number then?\n",
            "[00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:22,520]  20%.\n",
            "[00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:37,520]  Okay, got it. And also, can I actually follow up with one more question on cable TV side? So there's also a new policy discussing about the rezoning. So just a wonder, you know, what's your thoughts behind that?\n",
            "[00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:59,260]  Even though there's a rezoning and open up for competition, the NCC actually has received several applications for entering certain regions for competition.\n",
            "[00:18:00,260 --> 00:18:16,260]  But NCC also realized they don't have a complete process and procedures to ensure they can review the application properly. They can set the competition rule straight.\n",
            "[00:18:16,260 --> 00:18:36,260]  So up to now, even though they have received this application, they haven't made any decision yet. So they haven't published any rules regarding how they will review and how in the future, in certain regions, how they should compete, how the different players should compete.\n",
            "[00:18:36,260 --> 00:18:48,260]  So it's still up in the air. And I don't see this will happen. NCC will come out with any guidance in the near future.\n",
            "[00:18:49,260 --> 00:19:04,260]  Sure. So let's say if there's any more clear guidance or policy given out in the next one or two years, do you guys have incentive to get into the other part of Taiwan to launch this business as well?\n",
            "[00:19:04,260 --> 00:19:24,260]  Well, certainly. As you know, we are constrained by the law that we are not able to enter other regions for competition because the NCC considers we control one third of the market currently.\n",
            "[00:19:25,260 --> 00:19:49,260]  So under the current law, we are not allowed to enter more regions to compete. Unless NCC and the government has revised the law so that we can enter, revise the one third law. Otherwise, we cannot, even though we are interested in entering new regions for competition. But under the current law, we are not allowed to do that.\n",
            "[00:19:50,260 --> 00:20:08,260]  Sure. Thank you. So my last question is on 4G. So I understand that the bidding process probably will start later part of this year. So what's your strategy on 4G? And also you think 4G will change your capex profile as well as the dividend policy in future? Thank you.\n",
            "[00:20:09,260 --> 00:20:17,260]  Well, it's really too early to say. And in the meantime, I don't think I would disclose my 4G strategy.\n",
            "[00:20:19,260 --> 00:20:30,260]  Okay. That's fair. Then how about your dividend policy? Can we expect also such level of special dividend payout in the coming few years as well?\n",
            "[00:20:31,260 --> 00:20:50,260]  Well, dividend policy is always decided by the board in every April every year. So it's hard for us to judge whether we will continue or further improve our dividend policy.\n",
            "[00:20:51,260 --> 00:21:01,260]  So as I mentioned many, many times, TARM Mobile is very committed to enhancing shareholder return. That's probably all we can share with you at this moment.\n",
            "[00:21:03,260 --> 00:21:04,260]  Okay. Thank you.\n",
            "[00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:24,360]  Thank you. One second, ladies and gentlemen. If you'd like to register for a question, please press star one key now. Thank you.\n",
            "[00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:34,820]  Next, we have a follow-up question with Mr. Chai Thapan with Credit Suisse.\n",
            "[00:21:35,820 --> 00:21:45,820]  Thank you. I just want to ask one more question regarding the smartphone usage on your network right now. You've shared with us what's the average usage right now. Thank you.\n",
            "[00:21:50,610 --> 00:21:53,610]  Less than 2GB per month.\n",
            "[00:21:54,610 --> 00:21:55,610]  Less than 2GB per month?\n",
            "[00:21:56,610 --> 00:21:57,610]  Yes.\n",
            "[00:21:57,610 --> 00:21:58,610]  And how is that compared to last year?\n",
            "[00:21:59,610 --> 00:22:14,080]  Let me check the number. Double what we had last year.\n",
            "[00:22:15,080 --> 00:22:18,080]  So it's still double what you had last year. That is perfect. Thank you very much.\n",
            "[00:22:19,940 --> 00:22:24,940]  Thank you. One second, ladies and gentlemen. If you'd like to register for a question, please press star one key now. Thank you.\n",
            "[00:22:37,860 --> 00:22:40,860]  Next question comes from Lucy Liu with JP Morgan. Please go ahead.\n",
            "[00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:58,860]  Hi. Sorry. Can I ask a few more questions regarding operations? So I noticed that your mobile are poor this year. Actually, if we compare on a year-on-year basis, it seems like the growth starts to decelerate.\n",
            "[00:22:58,860 --> 00:23:18,860]  So can we understand the reason behind that given that we still have iPhone 5 and all these high-end smartphones launched in first quarter? Do you feel that because of smartphone penetration reached 40%, the high base start to decelerate your growth profile on the mobile side? Thank you.\n",
            "[00:23:29,560 --> 00:23:44,560]  I think based on the information that I have, our R pool maintains quite okay. But the R pool hasn't increased so much. There are several reasons.\n",
            "[00:23:44,560 --> 00:24:00,560]  One is that, as you know, this year we had this termination rate reduction or mandatory by mandated by the NCC. That's one issue. The voice R pool went down.\n",
            "[00:24:00,560 --> 00:24:26,560]  Second reason is that we have in the first quarter, 43% of our handset sales is really mid and low-end smartphones. So that increased data revenue, but not to a degree like the high-end version.\n",
            "[00:24:27,560 --> 00:24:45,560]  So these two reasons show that our R pool is kind of flattish compared with the last year. But even the R pool is kind of flat, but the mixture is different.\n",
            "[00:24:45,560 --> 00:25:04,560]  Because last year, this year our data revenue consists roughly 35% of our R pool. But last year, at the same time, it's really less than 30% or 25 to 30%. So the mixture is different.\n",
            "[00:25:05,560 --> 00:25:06,560]  Okay.\n",
            "[00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:23,640]  Okay. Got it. And also, can you remind us how much net impact you guys have from this MTR rate change on your EBITDA?\n",
            "[00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:27,080]  You mean for the first quarter?\n",
            "[00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:32,080]  For the first quarter. Or if you have a full-year number, that would be great too.\n",
            "[00:25:33,080 --> 00:25:53,540]  For the EBITDA, it's less than $0.4 billion a year as forecasted. So for mobile termination rate.\n",
            "[00:25:55,540 --> 00:25:58,540]  Okay. Thank you.\n",
            "[00:26:01,540 --> 00:26:03,540]  Sorry, last question from my side.\n",
            "[00:26:04,540 --> 00:26:07,430]  Yeah?\n",
            "[00:26:08,430 --> 00:26:14,710]  Excuse me?\n",
            "[00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:17,000]  Hello?\n",
            "[00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,000]  Yes, hello. Can you hear me?\n",
            "[00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:35,000]  Yes, I have a question on your fixed line business. So if you look at the data, so February and March, it seems like your year-on-year decline accelerated to about 10%-ish on a monthly basis.\n",
            "[00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:42,000]  So what's the reason behind that? And also, what's the trend going forward for your fixed line part?\n",
            "[00:26:50,780 --> 00:27:03,700]  In the fixed line, the strategy we have is that we try to boost up the EBITDA margin in our fixed line business.\n",
            "[00:27:04,700 --> 00:27:13,700]  So we have done extensive review regarding the EBITDA of each product and EBITDA of our accounts.\n",
            "[00:27:14,700 --> 00:27:27,700]  So we try to, because fixed line business is really not a very promising business, so we try to focus on the improvement of EBITDA instead of revenue growth.\n",
            "[00:27:28,700 --> 00:27:48,700]  So in the fixed line business, I don't see significant improvements in revenue other than by the end of this year, we will have this cloud IDC, which will allow us to have more revenue momentum in the cloud service area.\n",
            "[00:27:48,700 --> 00:28:05,540]  Other than the cloud service revenue, our fixed line business revenue may continue to go down slowly, but the EBITDA will increase.\n",
            "[00:28:06,540 --> 00:28:10,530]  I understand. Thank you.\n",
            "[00:28:11,530 --> 00:28:19,740]  Thank you. One second, ladies and gentlemen. If you'd like to register for a question, please press star 1 key now. Thank you.\n",
            "[00:28:20,740 --> 00:28:27,840]  Our next question comes from Alan Lin with BNP Hong Kong. Please go ahead.\n",
            "[00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:34,840]  Hi. I have a couple of related questions on your slide number 5 regarding mobile data adoption rate.\n",
            "[00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:46,840]  Well, I guess these numbers looking in the past four quarters plus Q1 2013, these numbers seem to be a little bit higher than what was disclosed last year.\n",
            "[00:28:46,840 --> 00:28:55,840]  Have there been any adjustments made? And if so, what were the adjustments that caused these penetration rates to be slightly higher than previously disclosed?\n",
            "[00:28:56,840 --> 00:29:09,500]  You have to read this carefully. Before fourth quarter last year, we disclosed so-called smartphone penetration.\n",
            "[00:29:10,500 --> 00:29:17,500]  Starting from fourth quarter last year, we started disclosing the mobile service.\n",
            "[00:29:17,500 --> 00:29:28,470]  Okay. So these are basically based on subscribers who actually pay for mobile data service, not just account of the smartphones in the market.\n",
            "[00:29:29,470 --> 00:29:32,780]  Right. Because we don't spend money on it.\n",
            "[00:29:36,180 --> 00:29:44,180]  Right. Okay. So I guess this is a more accurate count of people actually paying a premium for data service within your subscriber base then.\n",
            "[00:29:45,180 --> 00:29:46,180]  Correct.\n",
            "[00:29:46,180 --> 00:29:52,180]  Okay. Now, a second question related to that is specifically on smartphone ARPU.\n",
            "[00:29:53,180 --> 00:29:58,180]  Do you have any indications on the trend in the past few quarters and what it was for Q1?\n",
            "[00:30:00,280 --> 00:30:14,450]  Guys, it's on the decline. It's on the decline naturally as you can tell that we are now tapping into the mid to low end market.\n",
            "[00:30:14,450 --> 00:30:20,450]  So of course the ARPU of the smartphone users will go down.\n",
            "[00:30:21,450 --> 00:30:27,140]  So can I assume that it's at a level lower than Q4 last year?\n",
            "[00:30:28,140 --> 00:30:30,940]  Lower than first quarter of last year?\n",
            "[00:30:31,940 --> 00:30:32,940]  Q4.\n",
            "[00:30:33,940 --> 00:30:34,940]  Q4, yes.\n",
            "[00:30:35,940 --> 00:30:40,500]  Okay. Got it. Thank you.\n",
            "[00:30:41,500 --> 00:30:48,060]  Thank you. Our next question comes from Leo Anderson with HSBC Hong Kong. Please go ahead.\n",
            "[00:30:49,060 --> 00:30:54,350]  Hi. Good afternoon. I just had a couple of questions on the Momo business, how you see the trends they're developing.\n",
            "[00:30:55,350 --> 00:30:56,350]  Can you speak louder?\n",
            "[00:30:57,350 --> 00:30:58,350]  Leo, can you speak up?\n",
            "[00:30:59,350 --> 00:31:04,350]  Yeah. Sorry. On the Momo business, two questions on the TV home shopping area.\n",
            "[00:31:05,350 --> 00:31:08,350]  It's quite difficult to predict the trends in this segment.\n",
            "[00:31:09,350 --> 00:31:12,350]  Do you have any sort of color on how you're seeing the underlying business developing?\n",
            "[00:31:13,350 --> 00:31:14,350]  Do you expect it to decline over time?\n",
            "[00:31:15,350 --> 00:31:17,350]  What's the sort of margin contribution?\n",
            "[00:31:18,350 --> 00:31:24,350]  Secondly, there was talk a while back of a tie-up with Beijing cable TV company.\n",
            "[00:31:25,350 --> 00:31:28,350]  What's the progress on that, please? Thank you.\n",
            "[00:31:29,350 --> 00:31:51,700]  Sherry will answer the question.\n",
            "[00:31:52,700 --> 00:32:00,700]  Well, for Momo's TV home shopping business in Beijing, for the first quarter we have seen a lot of reduction.\n",
            "[00:32:00,700 --> 00:32:06,700]  So for the whole year they will pretty much continue the trend that we saw in the first quarter.\n",
            "[00:32:07,700 --> 00:32:20,700]  As for the business in Taiwan, the key is whether they can do better product differentiation in order to shake up the business.\n",
            "[00:32:21,700 --> 00:32:33,700]  Before they can do better product differentiation, to be on the conservative side, we shouldn't have too optimistic view on its TV home shopping business.\n",
            "[00:32:34,700 --> 00:32:53,700]  Overall speaking, on Momo we are trying to, as Cliff mentioned earlier, we are trying to help them review all their operations to reduce the losses from their physical channels.\n",
            "[00:32:54,700 --> 00:33:04,730]  And also to improve their business on the virtual channels.\n",
            "[00:33:05,730 --> 00:33:15,730]  So basically we think the outlook for the company should be up a bit this year.\n",
            "[00:33:16,730 --> 00:33:28,100]  Thank you. And then in terms of medium-term margin, EBITDA margin prospects, would you say mid to high single digits is what you are looking at?\n",
            "[00:33:29,100 --> 00:33:36,100]  Hopefully if we can reduce the losses from the physical stores, the chances are high.\n",
            "[00:33:37,100 --> 00:33:38,840]  Great. Thank you.\n",
            "[00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:47,240]  Thank you. Next we have a follow-up question from Ms. Lucy Liu of JP Morgan. Please go ahead.\n",
            "[00:33:47,240 --> 00:33:52,240]  Hi. Sorry. I have one more question. This is on your cable broadband business.\n",
            "[00:33:53,240 --> 00:34:04,240]  Recently there is a news saying that I think due to the price cut on the broadband side, it seems like you and Cable also lowered down the cable broadband offering price.\n",
            "[00:34:05,240 --> 00:34:15,240]  So can we have a better idea in terms of impact on your revenue or whether you expect more subscriber growth going forward? Thank you.\n",
            "[00:34:15,240 --> 00:34:21,340]  Well, even though the Zhonghua Telecom client, they have a price reduction.\n",
            "[00:34:22,340 --> 00:34:32,340]  But in reality we don't see that as a threat because our original price is significantly lower than CHD's price.\n",
            "[00:34:33,340 --> 00:34:38,340]  Therefore, we don't see any big impact in our revenue.\n",
            "[00:34:38,340 --> 00:34:50,340]  However, because of this price reduction, I think in the coming year we see more and more customers will choose high bandwidth, high speed cable modems.\n",
            "[00:34:51,340 --> 00:34:57,340]  So to answer your question, no, I don't see that will impact our revenue target.\n",
            "[00:34:58,340 --> 00:35:10,780]  Sorry, just to clarify. So I think according to you, maybe it's wrong, but you have already lowered down some of the price offering for your broadband service. Is that true?\n",
            "[00:35:11,780 --> 00:35:22,780]  Because that's very high speed. The users of those very high speed users are not a significant number.\n",
            "[00:35:23,780 --> 00:35:36,780]  So even though that price is lower, it really doesn't hurt so much because the absolute EBITDA contributed by those segments actually will be higher.\n",
            "[00:35:37,780 --> 00:35:41,780]  The margin will be lower, but the absolute EBITDA will be higher.\n",
            "[00:35:42,780 --> 00:35:50,780]  Sure, I understand that. So can I understand why you guys are offering discount of the broadband service over Zhonghua and also the speed is actually quite comparable.\n",
            "[00:35:51,780 --> 00:35:56,780]  But why you guys cannot even more aggressively gaining the broadband market share?\n",
            "[00:35:57,780 --> 00:36:03,690]  Frankly speaking, I think we have been very aggressive already.\n",
            "[00:36:04,690 --> 00:36:08,690]  Okay. So I thought you guys should do even better than this.\n",
            "[00:36:09,690 --> 00:36:22,690]  I think in this fixed network market, it's duopoly. So it really makes no sense that if we reduce price further because it's only going to‚Ä¶\n",
            "[00:36:22,690 --> 00:36:32,690]  So long as we have enough difference between our offering and CHD offering so that people can have a choice.\n",
            "[00:36:33,690 --> 00:36:44,690]  If we lower our price from our perspective as well, we lower our price too aggressively, CHD will have no choice but to lower the price, which really doesn't help the market at all.\n",
            "[00:36:45,690 --> 00:36:50,690]  Sure, I understand that. But I think we're reading to some of the recent industry data.\n",
            "[00:36:51,690 --> 00:36:59,690]  Seems like CHD's fiber to the FTTX is still gaining the absolute market share at expense of cable.\n",
            "[00:37:00,690 --> 00:37:04,690]  So I just wonder why people still stick with CHD's business rather than your cable broadband?\n",
            "[00:37:05,690 --> 00:37:11,690]  Well, you have to look at this market. There are two different markets.\n",
            "[00:37:12,690 --> 00:37:17,690]  The fiber to the home market is really in the metropolitan area like in Taipei City.\n",
            "[00:37:18,690 --> 00:37:30,690]  Because in the rural area, outside the metropolitan area, the fiber is really very expensive and even CHD cannot afford to do all the fiber to this rural area.\n",
            "[00:37:30,690 --> 00:37:45,690]  So CHD tends to have an upper hand because in the metropolitan area like Taipei, the CT has a very high penetration rate because they provided the broadband service a long time ago.\n",
            "[00:37:46,690 --> 00:37:54,690]  So it's an uphill battle for us even though our price is lower because of the inertia.\n",
            "[00:37:54,690 --> 00:38:06,690]  A lot of people still chose CHD, but in rural areas like more further away from Taipei, the cable more than sometimes can offer a speed much higher than CHD.\n",
            "[00:38:07,690 --> 00:38:11,690]  And in the past, the penetration rate was lower there.\n",
            "[00:38:11,690 --> 00:38:13,690]  The cable more than has an upper hand.\n",
            "[00:38:14,690 --> 00:38:33,690]  So you have two markets and we try to increase our market in those suburban areas while in the meantime trying to compete with CHD more effectively in the city.\n",
            "[00:38:34,690 --> 00:38:41,690]  So that's why we don't necessarily think that price reduction is necessarily a good way.\n",
            "[00:38:42,690 --> 00:38:59,690]  Our current approach is trying to bundle our cable more than with our digital TV service because right now we have a mandate from the NCC not only to increase the broadband penetration but also to increase the digital TV adoption.\n",
            "[00:39:00,690 --> 00:39:14,690]  So we try to price the digital TV more aggressively so that when people subscribe to our service, they not only get a cable more than service but they also get a digital TV service.\n",
            "[00:39:15,690 --> 00:39:18,690]  Sure. Thank you, Cliff. You're very helpful.\n",
            "[00:39:19,690 --> 00:39:27,260]  Thank you. Once again, ladies and gentlemen, if you'd like to register for a question, please press star 1 key now. Thank you.\n",
            "[00:39:27,260 --> 00:39:38,300]  If there's no further questions, then thank everyone for attending this conference.\n",
            "[00:39:39,300 --> 00:39:40,300]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:39:43,640 --> 00:39:44,640]  Have a good holiday.\n",
            "[00:39:45,640 --> 00:39:48,640]  Thank you. Thank you for participation. This concludes the conference.\n"

            "[00:01:18,110 --> 00:01:24,110]  First on mobile business, with a 45% worldwide growth in the wireless data revenue,\n",
            "[00:01:24,110 --> 00:01:30,270]  our mobile service revenue increased by 7% worldwide in the first quarter this year.\n",
            "[00:01:30,270 --> 00:01:39,940]  We also note that our mobile voice revenue declined narrow to 3% worldwide, versus the 7% worldwide drop a year ago.\n",
            "[00:01:39,940 --> 00:01:46,940]  In terms of data revenue as a percentage of mobile service revenue, Taiwan Mobile continues to lead the pack.\n",
            "[00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:51,190]  Please turn to the second page.\n",
            "[00:01:51,190 --> 00:01:57,190]  For our smartphone strategy, apart from the 10 exclusive smart device models we currently have,\n",
            "[00:01:57,190 --> 00:02:02,190]  we also have around 35 smartphone and tablet products on the market.\n",
            "[00:02:02,190 --> 00:02:11,370]  In the first quarter, smartphone users' output remained at nearly two times that of the post-paid,\n",
            "[00:02:11,370 --> 00:02:16,370]  and the payback periods of the two were actually very similar.\n",
            "[00:02:16,370 --> 00:02:26,500]  In first quarter 12, smartphone sales value was up 45% from a year ago, and accounted for 71% of total handsets sold.\n",
            "[00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:34,620]  As of the end of first quarter 12, smartphone penetration reached close to 27%.\n",
            "[00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:37,680]  Please turn to the next page.\n",
            "[00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:43,710]  As indicated in the table, our internet subscriber number increased of 12%,\n",
            "[00:02:43,710 --> 00:02:55,420]  and DTV customer number grows of 77%, or higher than 1% subscriber rise in the annual TV services in first quarter.\n",
            "[00:02:55,420 --> 00:03:04,420]  And our cable internet app will continue trading up, with 60% of new customers adopting 20-meg and above service.\n",
            "[00:03:04,420 --> 00:03:15,420]  Given that only 28% of our customers are using our internet service, and 90% of our customers have subscribed to DTV services,\n",
            "[00:03:15,420 --> 00:03:25,420]  we expect further expansion in internet and DTV service take-up to provide future revenue growth.\n",
            "[00:03:25,420 --> 00:03:28,600]  Please turn to the next page.\n",
            "[00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:36,600]  This page of new products and services, what we have launched during the first quarter, is for your reference.\n",
            "[00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:40,600]  I will turn the mic to Vivian on our financial results.\n",
            "[00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:57,140]  For our financial overview, in the first quarter of this year, our consolidated revenue grew by 32%, credited to a 7% YOY increase in mobile service revenue.\n",
            "[00:03:57,140 --> 00:04:06,140]  MOMO, the enterprise sanguine and cable TV division also contributed to the consolidated revenue increase.\n",
            "[00:04:06,140 --> 00:04:22,300]  Despite the rise in enhanced subsidies and direct store expenses from CBG, our first quarter consolidated EBITDA still managed to grow 5% YOY, mainly credited to MOMO's contribution.\n",
            "[00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:33,300]  In the first quarter of this year, both the combined service revenue of the three business groups and MOMO's revenue ahead of their respective guidance.\n",
            "[00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:38,300]  Only handset sales revenue came in lower than expectations.\n",
            "[00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:50,300]  Consolidated EBITDA surpassed our first quarter expectation by 4%, attributed to the group's better-than-expected cost and expense control,\n",
            "[00:04:50,300 --> 00:04:53,300]  and higher-than-expected EBITDA from MOMO.\n",
            "[00:04:53,300 --> 00:05:03,300]  Added by both co-business and non-operating front, our net profit exceeded the first quarter guidance by 7%.\n",
            "[00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:08,300]  Please turn to the next page for our operating performance by business group.\n",
            "[00:05:10,610 --> 00:05:17,610]  This quarter, CBG's accreted its mobile service revenue growth momentum to 6%.\n",
            "[00:05:17,610 --> 00:05:29,610]  Despite a 6% increase in service revenue and a 2% reduction in cash network costs, CBG did not see operating leverage in the quarter as well.\n",
            "[00:05:29,610 --> 00:05:33,610]  We're still investing in pushing up smartphone adoption.\n",
            "[00:05:33,610 --> 00:05:45,610]  CBG's growth in both revenue and EBITDA were mainly driven by the increase in broadband revenue from market share gains in the high-speed segment.\n",
            "[00:05:45,610 --> 00:05:57,640]  EBG posted double-digit YOY growth in profits, credited to the rising enterprise mobile and IT transit business, coupled with contended expenses.\n",
            "[00:05:57,640 --> 00:06:07,640]  On a quarter-over-quarter basis, EBG's EBITDA declined as due to higher sales of iPhone 4 packages.\n",
            "[00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:14,640]  MOMO's first quarter of this year revenue increased mainly came from a rise in online shopping revenue.\n",
            "[00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:20,640]  Let me turn the presentation over to Rosie for balance sheet and cash flow analysis.\n",
            "[00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:24,950]  Now let's turn to the balance sheet page.\n",
            "[00:06:24,950 --> 00:06:32,370]  The increase in inventory from a quarter ago came from both our mobile and MOMO operations.\n",
            "[00:06:32,370 --> 00:06:39,400]  Compared to a year ago, our inventory rose to reflect the inclusion of MOMOs primarily.\n",
            "[00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:48,500]  The year-on-year increase in tangible assets arose from our investment in MOMOs since July 2011.\n",
            "[00:06:50,040 --> 00:07:07,070]  If you look at our liabilities and shareholders equity section, you'll find our gross debt balance fell to $13.6 billion due to $4.3 billion short-term borrowing repayment in the quarter.\n",
            "[00:07:07,070 --> 00:07:14,230]  That caused our net debt to further decline to $8 billion by end of the first quarter.\n",
            "[00:07:14,230 --> 00:07:23,780]  On the ratios front, our current ratios sequential rise came as a result of reduction in short-term debt,\n",
            "[00:07:23,780 --> 00:07:28,780]  which also improved our net debt to EBITDA and net debt to equity ratios.\n",
            "[00:07:28,780 --> 00:07:34,870]  Our return on equity remains as high as 26%.\n",
            "[00:07:34,870 --> 00:07:39,350]  Now let's turn to cash flow analysis.\n",
            "[00:07:39,350 --> 00:07:49,830]  Our operating cash inflows for the quarter decreased sequentially due to payments made for fourth quarter of 2011 and debt procurement,\n",
            "[00:07:49,830 --> 00:07:56,060]  and initially bonuses in first quarter of this year.\n",
            "[00:07:56,060 --> 00:08:03,060]  Having said that, the cash level in first quarter remains similar to that of a year ago.\n",
            "[00:08:03,060 --> 00:08:17,660]  On the net investing cash flow in the first quarter, the net investing cash outflow was largely for the $1.5 billion in cash capex,\n",
            "[00:08:17,660 --> 00:08:30,760]  and the $4.3 billion short-term debt repayment was the main cash outflow item for financing activity during the quarter.\n",
            "[00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:41,180]  On the capex and free cash flow, the decline in operating cash inflow in the first quarter led to a lower free cash flow\n",
            "[00:08:41,180 --> 00:08:46,360]  and an annualized yield of 6%.\n",
            "[00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:53,360]  Now let me turn the mic over to Vivian for event update and key message.\n",
            "[00:08:55,480 --> 00:09:07,510]  For the year 2011 earnings distribution, our board meeting today approved a proposal to distribute $13.9 billion of cash dividends\n",
            "[00:09:07,510 --> 00:09:23,740]  comprised of 90% of year 2000 earnings, $822 million of special reserve, and $937 million of inappropriate earnings,\n",
            "[00:09:23,740 --> 00:09:29,770]  translating into 103% payout to shareholders.\n",
            "[00:09:29,770 --> 00:09:36,860]  Dividend per share is $5.16 based on our outstanding shares.\n",
            "[00:09:36,860 --> 00:09:42,860]  Excluding treasure shares held by 100% owned subsidiaries.\n",
            "[00:09:42,860 --> 00:09:50,730]  Separately, the bottom portion of the slide lists the awards that we have recently received for your reference.\n",
            "[00:09:50,730 --> 00:09:54,950]  Please turn to the key messages page.\n",
            "[00:09:54,950 --> 00:10:01,950]  In the near term, we will continue to commit most of the resources into pursuing future revenue growth.\n",
            "[00:10:02,950 --> 00:10:11,950]  Continuous enhancement of operating leverage is underway to ensure our attainment of our financial target of this year.\n",
            "[00:10:11,950 --> 00:10:21,650]  To wrap up our presentation, the last slide summarizes the key message that we would like to deliver.\n",
            "[00:10:21,650 --> 00:10:46,230]  Now we would like to open the floor for the questions.\n",
            "[00:10:46,230 --> 00:10:56,790]  We are open for Q&A session.\n",
            "[00:10:57,790 --> 00:10:59,790]  We are now pulling for questions.\n",
            "[00:10:59,790 --> 00:11:03,790]  Ladies and gentlemen, to register for questions, please press star 1.\n",
            "[00:11:03,790 --> 00:11:07,190]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:11:07,190 --> 00:11:11,190]  Our first questions come from Joseph Quinn from Macquarie, Taipei.\n",
            "[00:11:11,190 --> 00:11:13,420]  Please go ahead.\n",
            "[00:11:13,420 --> 00:11:17,420]  Thanks for the opportunity to ask some questions and congratulations on the very good results.\n",
            "[00:11:17,420 --> 00:11:21,420]  I've got three quick questions, hopefully not too challenging.\n",
            "[00:11:21,420 --> 00:11:24,420]  The first one is on your smartphone.\n",
            "[00:11:24,420 --> 00:11:26,420]  You've launched a new own-brand smartphone.\n",
            "[00:11:26,420 --> 00:11:30,420]  I'm just wondering what's your kind of target levels for that product?\n",
            "[00:11:30,420 --> 00:11:37,420]  How are you expecting the R-proof of that product and the sort of data packages you're going to do with that product also?\n",
            "[00:11:37,420 --> 00:11:40,420]  Then on to your cable business.\n",
            "[00:11:40,420 --> 00:11:45,420]  Do you have any targets for this year for your broadband and digital TV subscribers?\n",
            "[00:11:45,420 --> 00:11:50,420]  Clearly you have good growth in those last year, but I'm just wondering what you expect for 2012.\n",
            "[00:11:51,420 --> 00:12:00,420]  And on the cable, staying with the cable, how is the progress in terms of the amendments to the law regarding indirect government holdings?\n",
            "[00:12:00,420 --> 00:12:03,420]  Have you got any update on that side as well?\n",
            "[00:12:03,420 --> 00:12:06,980]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:12:06,980 --> 00:12:13,100]  The first question is regarding the low-end smartphone we just launched.\n",
            "[00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:17,310]  We will start to sell it.\n",
            "[00:12:17,310 --> 00:12:24,310]  And that smartphone is targeted towards those subscribers in the past.\n",
            "[00:12:24,310 --> 00:12:33,340]  Either they cannot afford a high-end smartphone, but they have a desire to use mobile Internet.\n",
            "[00:12:33,340 --> 00:12:37,440]  That's the first target customer.\n",
            "[00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:47,440]  The other groups of customers we targeted is for those who would like to use smartphones.\n",
            "[00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:55,860]  They use feature phones, but they think they may try smartphones, but they may not have a great need for mobile Internet.\n",
            "[00:12:55,860 --> 00:12:59,860]  But somehow they still want to have a smartphone.\n",
            "[00:12:59,860 --> 00:13:06,020]  So they wouldn't like to pay too much for a smartphone.\n",
            "[00:13:06,020 --> 00:13:11,300]  So we have two package offers to these two kinds of customers.\n",
            "[00:13:11,300 --> 00:13:18,300]  One package is for those who want smartphones, but lower price.\n",
            "[00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:21,340]  And we give them mobile Internet access.\n",
            "[00:13:21,340 --> 00:13:26,340]  And the second category of customers, we give them like show message service.\n",
            "[00:13:26,340 --> 00:13:31,650]  For instance, 100 free show message service.\n",
            "[00:13:31,650 --> 00:13:33,650]  These are for the second.\n",
            "[00:13:33,650 --> 00:13:43,650]  We hope this can drive the low-end segment of the smartphone to increase our penetration to 75%.\n",
            "[00:13:43,650 --> 00:13:50,130]  Currently we sell on monthly basis 70% of our sales is from smartphones.\n",
            "[00:13:50,130 --> 00:13:53,130]  We try to increase to maybe 75%.\n",
            "[00:13:53,130 --> 00:13:59,290]  Maybe even have a chance to reach maybe 80% by the end of this year.\n",
            "[00:13:59,290 --> 00:14:05,020]  So this is the target for our smartphone, the low-end smartphone.\n",
            "[00:14:05,020 --> 00:14:13,440]  As for this year, I have a target for broadband.\n",
            "[00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:22,620]  Basically it's to increase our subscriber base by 12%.\n",
            "[00:14:22,620 --> 00:14:30,620]  But the major thing is not only to increase the broadband penetration, but also to increase the output.\n",
            "[00:14:30,620 --> 00:14:35,720]  Because this year we are going to push like 50 meg service.\n",
            "[00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:39,720]  Because nowadays we have a significant number of broadband.\n",
            "[00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:45,720]  If we can increase the output somewhat, it can be even more profitable.\n",
            "[00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:54,720]  So the key now, not only the net increase of broadband user, but also the increase of the output.\n",
            "[00:14:54,720 --> 00:15:00,330]  As for digital TV, we have a very aggressive target.\n",
            "[00:15:00,330 --> 00:15:07,330]  It's 75,000 subscribers versus 46,000 by the end of last year.\n",
            "[00:15:07,330 --> 00:15:13,180]  So it's a 63% growth.\n",
            "[00:15:13,180 --> 00:15:21,700]  And the last amendment of the law, we are still pushing at this moment.\n",
            "[00:15:21,700 --> 00:15:28,700]  However, currently the government is in, as you know, the government has a lot of issues to handle.\n",
            "[00:15:29,700 --> 00:15:40,690]  Because President Ma has taxed things, the rise of the utility bill, those kind of things.\n",
            "[00:15:40,690 --> 00:15:45,690]  So I'm not sure whether this is their top priority in the second quarter.\n",
            "[00:15:45,690 --> 00:15:48,850]  But we are still trying very hard.\n",
            "[00:15:48,850 --> 00:15:49,850]  Understood. Thank you.\n",
            "[00:15:49,850 --> 00:15:51,850]  Can I just follow up on two items?\n",
            "[00:15:51,850 --> 00:15:56,850]  One on the digital TV side, with that aggressive push on digital TV,\n",
            "[00:15:56,850 --> 00:16:02,850]  is it fair to assume that you're staying with the same sort of package as you've done before?\n",
            "[00:16:02,850 --> 00:16:09,850]  Or is this, as you increase your 50 megabyte services, you're more aggressively cross-selling the digital TV?\n",
            "[00:16:09,850 --> 00:16:15,850]  And then on a second topic, I just forgot to mention it, on the dividend policy.\n",
            "[00:16:15,850 --> 00:16:20,850]  Have you changed your dividend policy going forward now, given the higher payout ratio?\n",
            "[00:16:20,850 --> 00:16:23,850]  Or are you maintaining the 90% payout? Thank you.\n",
            "[00:16:23,850 --> 00:16:33,900]  Okay. On the first issue, I think in the cable side, same strategy.\n",
            "[00:16:33,900 --> 00:16:42,380]  Because in the past, that strategy was, and we didn't see any reason to change.\n",
            "[00:16:42,380 --> 00:16:48,420]  It's going to be status quo.\n",
            "[00:16:48,420 --> 00:16:55,770]  As for the second question, regarding the dividend payout, let me have Rosie to answer this.\n",
            "[00:16:56,930 --> 00:17:01,930]  Yeah. On the dividend policy, we still, as you know,\n",
            "[00:17:01,930 --> 00:17:08,930]  we still have a lot of room for topping up our dividend for the future.\n",
            "[00:17:08,930 --> 00:17:13,930]  As of the end of last year, we have a total of $23.6 billion,\n",
            "[00:17:13,930 --> 00:17:19,930]  of which $12.4 billion is from capital surplus,\n",
            "[00:17:19,930 --> 00:17:26,930]  and $8.2 billion from legal reserves, and the rest from retained earnings.\n",
            "[00:17:26,930 --> 00:17:33,930]  So quite a lot of room for us to topping up.\n",
            "[00:17:33,930 --> 00:17:44,930]  I tend to, I think I understand your question, that with the amendment of the law in the beginning of the year,\n",
            "[00:17:45,930 --> 00:17:52,930]  you are all very concerned about whether we will pay out more.\n",
            "[00:17:52,930 --> 00:18:00,930]  I think we will definitely keep the shareholders' interest in mind,\n",
            "[00:18:00,930 --> 00:18:14,090]  and we'll continue asking our consolidated, our wholly owned subsidiaries to forego dividend on their part.\n",
            "[00:18:15,090 --> 00:18:22,090]  These wholly owned subsidiaries are those who hold our treasury shares.\n",
            "[00:18:22,090 --> 00:18:28,090]  So on all these, I think it will be maintained.\n",
            "[00:18:28,090 --> 00:18:34,090]  As to whether we will top up for the long term or in one go,\n",
            "[00:18:34,090 --> 00:18:40,180]  I think in one go, that's totally impossible for us,\n",
            "[00:18:40,180 --> 00:18:47,690]  and we will continue our stable dividend policy for the future.\n",
            "[00:18:47,690 --> 00:18:48,690]  Okay, thank you.\n",
            "[00:18:48,690 --> 00:18:51,690]  So in terms of a stable dividend policy, are we talking,\n",
            "[00:18:51,690 --> 00:18:55,690]  we're not talking about a flat rate in terms of maintaining that.\n",
            "[00:18:55,690 --> 00:18:59,690]  You're more that you'll recommit to 90% and then go forward.\n",
            "[00:18:59,690 --> 00:19:03,690]  You may add on additional, correct?\n",
            "[00:19:03,690 --> 00:19:09,780]  I can definitely tell you that we will distribute 90%,\n",
            "[00:19:09,780 --> 00:19:16,780]  and we will definitely ask our wholly owned subsidiaries who hold the treasury shares to forego dividend.\n",
            "[00:19:16,780 --> 00:19:25,780]  As to the rest, which has more to do with the topping up,\n",
            "[00:19:25,780 --> 00:19:30,780]  it's up to the board to decide, so we cannot speak for them.\n",
            "[00:19:30,780 --> 00:19:32,780]  Understood. Thank you very much.\n",
            "[00:19:32,780 --> 00:19:33,780]  You're welcome.\n",
            "[00:19:33,780 --> 00:19:35,650]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:19:35,650 --> 00:19:39,650]  Thank you, and our next question comes from Ben Chai from Credit Suite Hong Kong.\n",
            "[00:19:39,650 --> 00:19:40,650]  Please go ahead.\n",
            "[00:19:40,650 --> 00:19:45,190]  Hi, good afternoon, and thank you very much for the call.\n",
            "[00:19:45,190 --> 00:19:46,190]  Congratulations on the result.\n",
            "[00:19:46,190 --> 00:19:48,190]  I have four questions.\n",
            "[00:19:48,190 --> 00:19:52,190]  The first question is regarding the smartphone penetration.\n",
            "[00:19:52,190 --> 00:19:56,190]  May I confirm again that on your post-paid subscriber base right now,\n",
            "[00:19:56,190 --> 00:20:04,290]  27% are smartphone users, and do you have any specific target for this number by the end of the year?\n",
            "[00:20:04,290 --> 00:20:08,290]  The second question is regarding your full year guidance.\n",
            "[00:20:08,290 --> 00:20:12,290]  First quarter seems to be running ahead of guidance for quite a bit,\n",
            "[00:20:12,290 --> 00:20:20,290]  but of course in your statement guidance you say that you just expect to achieve, to attain your target.\n",
            "[00:20:20,290 --> 00:20:25,290]  So is it just a timing issue that allows you to surpass your target in the first quarter a lot,\n",
            "[00:20:25,290 --> 00:20:30,290]  and hence there will be an increase in costs and everything in the latter half of the year?\n",
            "[00:20:30,290 --> 00:20:34,580]  The third question is regarding your cable business, the cable mix.\n",
            "[00:20:34,580 --> 00:20:36,580]  I'm referring to slide six.\n",
            "[00:20:36,580 --> 00:20:43,580]  60% of the new subscribers in the first quarter is higher speed subscribers.\n",
            "[00:20:43,580 --> 00:20:50,580]  Are we talking about 60% of the 4,000 new subscribers you add on the cable Internet site,\n",
            "[00:20:50,580 --> 00:20:54,580]  or are we talking about the overall subscriber base?\n",
            "[00:20:55,580 --> 00:21:00,580]  The fourth question is regarding the cable broadband competition.\n",
            "[00:21:00,580 --> 00:21:08,580]  Do you think the growth that you are getting from right now is getting from your competitors,\n",
            "[00:21:08,580 --> 00:21:11,580]  or is it actually just the new broadband users?\n",
            "[00:21:38,490 --> 00:21:45,490]  As for question one, the target for us is by the end of this year\n",
            "[00:21:45,490 --> 00:21:49,490]  we can achieve more than 35% penetration in this market.\n",
            "[00:21:49,490 --> 00:21:56,580]  As far as to what level, 36% or 37% or 38%, it's all possible.\n",
            "[00:21:56,580 --> 00:22:01,290]  It really depends on the market situation.\n",
            "[00:22:01,290 --> 00:22:08,150]  And the full year guidance, I think we will stick with the full year guidance,\n",
            "[00:22:08,150 --> 00:22:20,860]  because as you know, the government has raised the price of the oil, electricity, and a lot of things,\n",
            "[00:22:20,860 --> 00:22:26,020]  and also have imposed new tax on some markets.\n",
            "[00:22:26,020 --> 00:22:30,020]  So the market now is quite uneasy.\n",
            "[00:22:30,020 --> 00:22:34,020]  So we don't know whether this will hurt the consumption or not.\n",
            "[00:22:34,020 --> 00:22:39,020]  So in this case, even though we are ahead in the first quarter,\n",
            "[00:22:39,020 --> 00:22:43,020]  as you know, we can try to be more conservative.\n",
            "[00:22:43,020 --> 00:22:51,560]  And as for question three, when we say 60% for new subscribers,\n",
            "[00:22:51,560 --> 00:22:53,560]  it's not the consumer base.\n",
            "[00:22:53,560 --> 00:22:57,230]  For new subscribers, 60% is the highest bid.\n",
            "[00:22:57,230 --> 00:23:03,540]  Most of the new subscribers are from CHT.\n",
            "[00:23:03,540 --> 00:23:15,080]  Yes, just one follow-up question regarding your cable broadband subscriber base right now.\n",
            "[00:23:15,080 --> 00:23:18,080]  So if we look at the total subscribers right now,\n",
            "[00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:22,080]  what is the mix between lower speed and higher speed subscribers?\n",
            "[00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:36,620]  Higher speed accounts for about 17% of the total.\n",
            "[00:23:36,620 --> 00:23:42,780]  Higher speed means over 20 Mbps.\n",
            "[00:23:42,780 --> 00:23:48,310]  17, is that right?\n",
            "[00:23:48,310 --> 00:23:49,310]  Yes, 17.\n",
            "[00:23:49,310 --> 00:24:02,670]  Thank you so much.\n",
            "[00:24:02,670 --> 00:24:06,600]  Thank you. And can we go to the next question, ma'am?\n",
            "[00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:07,600]  Yes.\n",
            "[00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:11,600]  Okay, our next question comes from Solomon Chun from Citigroup Hong Kong.\n",
            "[00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:12,600]  Please go ahead.\n",
            "[00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:13,600]  Thank you very much.\n",
            "[00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:17,600]  And I just have one quick question on the smartphone.\n",
            "[00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:20,600]  Of the 27% of smartphone penetration,\n",
            "[00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:25,600]  can you share with us the split between the iPhone, iOS, and Android?\n",
            "[00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:26,600]  Thanks a lot.\n",
            "[00:24:26,600 --> 00:25:04,130]  Okay, currently, iPhone takes up roughly 25% of it,\n",
            "[00:25:04,130 --> 00:25:15,980]  and Android is getting more market share.\n",
            "[00:25:15,980 --> 00:25:19,980]  So the rest, I can assume that it is the Windows and the battery, right?\n",
            "[00:25:19,980 --> 00:25:22,160]  Excuse me?\n",
            "[00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:28,160]  So for the rest, I can assume it comes from the Windows Mobile and the battery.\n",
            "[00:25:29,830 --> 00:25:36,600]  The rest is really Windows and Blackberry.\n",
            "[00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:39,870]  Thank you very much.\n",
            "[00:25:39,870 --> 00:25:40,870]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:25:40,870 --> 00:25:43,870]  And our next question comes from Lucy Liu from JPMorgan Hong Kong.\n",
            "[00:25:43,870 --> 00:25:44,870]  Please go ahead.\n",
            "[00:25:44,870 --> 00:25:45,870]  Hi, thank you very much.\n",
            "[00:25:45,870 --> 00:25:48,870]  So I have three questions.\n",
            "[00:25:48,870 --> 00:25:54,870]  One is still on your first quarter results versus the full year guidance.\n",
            "[00:25:54,870 --> 00:25:58,870]  So it seems like if you look at the equipment sales revenue,\n",
            "[00:25:58,870 --> 00:26:01,870]  first quarter only achieved like 20% of the full year guidance,\n",
            "[00:26:01,870 --> 00:26:06,870]  like $10 billion, despite of iPhone 4S sales.\n",
            "[00:26:06,870 --> 00:26:11,870]  So just to wonder whether you see any downside risk on that front.\n",
            "[00:26:11,870 --> 00:26:13,870]  And the second is on Momo.\n",
            "[00:26:13,870 --> 00:26:18,870]  So I understand that I think most of the revenue coming from online shopping,\n",
            "[00:26:18,870 --> 00:26:20,870]  business pickup in first quarter.\n",
            "[00:26:20,870 --> 00:26:24,870]  So do you have any comments regarding this year's business outlook\n",
            "[00:26:24,870 --> 00:26:26,870]  as well as the margin?\n",
            "[00:26:26,870 --> 00:26:30,870]  It seems like the margin now trended down below 7%.\n",
            "[00:26:30,870 --> 00:26:32,870]  So what's the trend going forward?\n",
            "[00:26:32,870 --> 00:26:36,870]  And lastly is on your EBITDA margin.\n",
            "[00:26:36,870 --> 00:26:42,870]  So I think we're glad to see the EBITDA margin recovery month by month\n",
            "[00:26:42,870 --> 00:26:44,870]  in first quarter.\n",
            "[00:26:44,870 --> 00:26:51,870]  But then I think versus your previous guidance like 28% for the full year,\n",
            "[00:26:51,870 --> 00:26:55,870]  it seems like March trend actually already showed about like 30%.\n",
            "[00:26:55,870 --> 00:26:59,870]  So I think operating leverage will further help your margin.\n",
            "[00:26:59,870 --> 00:27:03,870]  So just to wonder what's your outlook on the margin side.\n",
            "[00:27:03,870 --> 00:27:07,720]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:27:07,720 --> 00:27:12,720]  The equipment sales in the first quarter is below our forecast.\n",
            "[00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:23,100]  This is partly due to a little lower sales volume of iPhone 4S.\n",
            "[00:27:24,520 --> 00:27:31,550]  But these equipment sales really doesn't affect our profitability\n",
            "[00:27:31,550 --> 00:27:35,550]  or other things because most of our equipment sales are really bundled.\n",
            "[00:27:35,550 --> 00:27:40,550]  And the major driver for this equipment sales revenue is really iPhone.\n",
            "[00:27:40,550 --> 00:27:51,570]  On the Momo margin, it's the Internet growth,\n",
            "[00:27:51,570 --> 00:27:54,570]  Internet revenue growth that's pushing down the margin.\n",
            "[00:27:54,570 --> 00:28:01,400]  So Cliff will answer the EBITDA margin trend,\n",
            "[00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:05,400]  our outlook for this year for our consolidated numbers,\n",
            "[00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:08,400]  our mobile numbers.\n",
            "[00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:18,570]  As you know, in the last conference,\n",
            "[00:28:19,570 --> 00:28:26,820]  I mentioned about a major factor is really iPhone.\n",
            "[00:28:26,820 --> 00:28:36,340]  So the iPhone has always been a factor in the margin we have.\n",
            "[00:28:36,340 --> 00:28:42,340]  As you can see, in December and January when we sold a lot of iPhone,\n",
            "[00:28:42,340 --> 00:28:45,620]  it really affected our margin.\n",
            "[00:28:45,620 --> 00:28:52,140]  But the iPhone slowed down in February and March, so our margin rebounded.\n",
            "[00:28:52,140 --> 00:28:59,940]  And there was a lot of rumor regarding when Apple will launch the iPhone 5.\n",
            "[00:28:59,940 --> 00:29:05,100]  It's maybe in August, in June, or in October.\n",
            "[00:29:05,100 --> 00:29:09,100]  These will affect how many iPhone we sell for this year.\n",
            "[00:29:09,100 --> 00:29:14,100]  So in a way, of course, when we do the whole year forecast,\n",
            "[00:29:14,100 --> 00:29:19,100]  we have included all these variables into our forecast.\n",
            "[00:29:19,100 --> 00:29:25,700]  So we are committed to achieve our full year guidance.\n",
            "[00:29:25,700 --> 00:29:33,700]  But at this moment, it's very hard for me to tell whether the margin will go up sequentially.\n",
            "[00:29:33,700 --> 00:29:38,060]  It really depends on the iPhone.\n",
            "[00:29:38,060 --> 00:29:41,330]  Okay, thank you.\n",
            "[00:29:41,330 --> 00:29:44,330]  So can I actually have a follow-up question on Momo?\n",
            "[00:29:44,330 --> 00:29:50,330]  So do you feel that the business environment or economy environment\n",
            "[00:29:50,330 --> 00:29:57,330]  or operation of Momo currently or year-to-date are meeting up your expectation of the business?\n",
            "[00:29:57,330 --> 00:30:04,330]  And also, what's the synergies you're actually achieving between your business and the Momo,\n",
            "[00:30:04,330 --> 00:30:08,830]  if there is any? Thank you.\n",
            "[00:30:08,830 --> 00:30:13,830]  I think in the first quarter, the Momo is ahead of its budget.\n",
            "[00:30:13,830 --> 00:30:21,830]  So the Momo performance meets our expectation.\n",
            "[00:30:21,830 --> 00:30:31,100]  And regarding the synergy, we are working on something.\n",
            "[00:30:31,100 --> 00:30:38,100]  I think hopefully some of the synergy or some of the effort we collaborate with Momo\n",
            "[00:30:38,100 --> 00:30:42,100]  will show up in the second half of this year.\n",
            "[00:30:42,100 --> 00:30:45,480]  Okay, thank you.\n",
            "[00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:49,750]  Thank you once again, ladies and gentlemen.\n",
            "[00:30:49,750 --> 00:30:52,750]  To register for questions, please press Star 1.\n",
            "[00:30:52,750 --> 00:31:00,300]  Once again, it's Star 1 to register for questions. Thank you.\n",
            "[00:31:00,300 --> 00:31:05,300]  And we have a follow-up question coming up from Mr. Ben Chia from Credit Suite Hong Kong.\n",
            "[00:31:05,300 --> 00:31:06,300]  Please go ahead.\n",
            "[00:31:06,300 --> 00:31:07,300]  Thank you very much.\n",
            "[00:31:07,300 --> 00:31:11,300]  Just one follow-up question on your house brand mobile phone.\n",
            "[00:31:11,300 --> 00:31:16,340]  So what's the name of the brand and what's the selling price point?\n",
            "[00:31:17,370 --> 00:31:24,370]  The model name is amazing, A1.\n",
            "[00:31:24,370 --> 00:31:33,400]  And the selling price is $3,990.\n",
            "[00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:38,880]  So it's almost like $130.\n",
            "[00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:44,590]  Okay, thank you very much.\n",
            "[00:31:44,590 --> 00:31:49,590]  Thank you. And we have another follow-up question come from Ms. Lucy Liu from JP Morgan Hong Kong.\n",
            "[00:31:49,590 --> 00:31:50,590]  Please go ahead.\n",
            "[00:31:50,590 --> 00:31:52,590]  Hi, sorry. I have two follow-up questions.\n",
            "[00:31:52,590 --> 00:31:56,590]  One is on your backhaul.\n",
            "[00:31:56,590 --> 00:32:03,590]  Can you share with us how much backhaul infrastructure you use already,\n",
            "[00:32:03,590 --> 00:32:10,590]  basically built by yourself and how much you're still using from Chunhua or the other guys?\n",
            "[00:32:10,590 --> 00:32:14,590]  And secondly is on your smartphone.\n",
            "[00:32:14,590 --> 00:32:23,590]  So what's the product mix with the smartphone in terms of like a mid-end, low-end versus high-end?\n",
            "[00:32:23,590 --> 00:32:26,740]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:32:26,740 --> 00:32:35,740]  90% of our backhaul is ‚Äì we built 90% of our backhaul.\n",
            "[00:32:35,740 --> 00:32:39,830]  So we only rent roughly 10% from CHT.\n",
            "[00:32:40,830 --> 00:32:49,830]  And as for the mix of the high, middle, and low, I think it really fluctuates every month.\n",
            "[00:32:49,830 --> 00:33:01,750]  And as for April, I think the high-end is roughly maybe 30%.\n",
            "[00:33:01,750 --> 00:33:07,850]  The middle-end is roughly another 30%, 25% to 30%.\n",
            "[00:33:07,850 --> 00:33:10,940]  The low-end is roughly 30% to 35%.\n",
            "[00:33:10,940 --> 00:33:15,370]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:33:15,370 --> 00:33:19,370]  So in terms of smartphone launch in the rest of the year,\n",
            "[00:33:19,370 --> 00:33:22,370]  so besides like iPhone as we understand,\n",
            "[00:33:22,370 --> 00:33:30,780]  so what are the mainly the other branded smartphones in which tier are they mostly in?\n",
            "[00:33:30,780 --> 00:33:40,780]  Well, out of the iPhone, the high-end consists of like Samsung Galaxy S2 and the Samsung Galaxy Note.\n",
            "[00:33:40,780 --> 00:33:53,360]  And in April, we also include the HTC One X and also Samsung Galaxy, Samsung Nexus.\n",
            "[00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:55,970]  That's about it.\n",
            "[00:33:55,970 --> 00:34:00,460]  Okay, I understand.\n",
            "[00:34:00,460 --> 00:34:03,150]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:34:03,150 --> 00:34:04,150]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:34:04,150 --> 00:34:07,150]  And our next question comes from Mr. Joseph Quinn from Macquarie, Taipei.\n",
            "[00:34:07,150 --> 00:34:08,150]  Please go ahead.\n",
            "[00:34:08,150 --> 00:34:09,380]  Hi, Cliff.\n",
            "[00:34:09,380 --> 00:34:11,380]  Just two quick follow-up questions.\n",
            "[00:34:11,380 --> 00:34:14,380]  One on your enterprise customers.\n",
            "[00:34:14,380 --> 00:34:21,380]  I've noticed that you've been gaining quite good momentum in terms of enterprise growth in the last two quarters.\n",
            "[00:34:21,380 --> 00:34:25,380]  I'm just wondering what your expectations are there and if you have any idea,\n",
            "[00:34:25,380 --> 00:34:29,380]  sorry, in terms of what your S&B market share would be.\n",
            "[00:34:29,380 --> 00:34:33,380]  And then the second question is on 4G licenses in Taiwan.\n",
            "[00:34:33,380 --> 00:34:38,380]  Just want to know kind of your thoughts on the process there in terms of timing\n",
            "[00:34:38,380 --> 00:34:44,380]  and also maybe a strategy in terms of what you wish to do with your 2G if it needs to be re-farmed, et cetera.\n",
            "[00:34:44,380 --> 00:34:45,380]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:34:45,380 --> 00:34:59,940]  For the enterprise, I think as for the market share, I know our competitor has mentioned how much market share they are going to gain.\n",
            "[00:34:59,940 --> 00:35:05,940]  But in the enterprise market, it's really hard to say market share because you have so many different products.\n",
            "[00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:18,040]  I think the reason we are getting traction in the enterprise is because we are trying to provide mobile voice\n",
            "[00:35:18,040 --> 00:35:23,040]  and data service combined to help business mobility.\n",
            "[00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:28,330]  This is something we are working on in the two quarters.\n",
            "[00:35:28,330 --> 00:35:33,330]  I think this is maybe part of the reason we have some growth.\n",
            "[00:35:33,330 --> 00:35:47,670]  And as for the 4G, our view is that most likely the 4G license will be auctioned in the maybe first quarter or second quarter of 2014.\n",
            "[00:35:47,670 --> 00:35:56,860]  And of course, we have people to investigate this.\n",
            "[00:35:57,860 --> 00:36:05,960]  But as for the intention, our strategy, I guess right now it's not appropriate for me to elaborate on this.\n",
            "[00:36:05,960 --> 00:36:09,210]  Understood. Thank you very much.\n",
            "[00:36:09,210 --> 00:36:13,290]  Thank you once again, ladies and gentlemen.\n",
            "[00:36:13,290 --> 00:36:16,290]  To register for questions, please press star 1.\n",
            "[00:36:16,290 --> 00:36:19,290]  Once again, it's star 1 to register for questions. Thank you.\n",
            "[00:36:19,290 --> 00:36:35,740]  Excuse me, Mr. Lai, it seems to be no further questions at this point in time, sir.\n",
            "[00:36:35,740 --> 00:36:42,300]  Okay, if there's no further questions, let's close this conference call.\n",
            "[00:36:42,300 --> 00:36:45,300]  And thank you for attending the conference call.\n",
            "[00:36:45,300 --> 00:36:46,300]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:36:46,300 --> 00:36:49,850]  Thank you, everyone. This concludes your conference. Thank you.\n"

            "[00:01:16,590 --> 00:01:21,590]  In the next three slides, I would like to highlight our growth areas.\n",
            "[00:01:21,590 --> 00:01:23,590]  First, on mobile business.\n",
            "[00:01:23,590 --> 00:01:35,010]  Continued strong growth in wireless data revenue boosted mobile service revenue to increase by 6% worldwide for the first three quarters.\n",
            "[00:01:35,010 --> 00:01:41,010]  At the end of the third quarter, we have doubled our smartphone penetration to 35%.\n",
            "[00:01:41,010 --> 00:01:49,100]  As a result, our mobile broadband revenue increased 57% worldwide in the quarter.\n",

            "[00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:58,840]  For our smartphone strategy, apart from the 10 exclusive smartphone models we currently have,\n",
            "[00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:03,940]  we also have around 38 smartphone and tablet products on the market.\n",
            "[00:02:03,940 --> 00:02:11,030]  In the third quarter, smartphone sales volume was up 75% from a year ago,\n",
            "[00:02:11,030 --> 00:02:21,580]  and accounted for 74% of total sales with mid- to lower-end products, making up over 50%.\n",
            "[00:02:21,580 --> 00:02:26,670]  Year-to-date smartphone payback period has slightly shortened,\n",
            "[00:02:26,670 --> 00:02:35,060]  with its output at 1.8%, roughly 180%, that of the post-pandemic.\n",

            "[00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:45,300]  As indicated in the table, our internet subscriber number increased by 10%,\n",
            "[00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:56,340]  and DTV customer number growth of 73% or higher than the 1% subscriber rise in annual TV services in the third quarter.\n",
            "[00:02:56,340 --> 00:03:00,340]  Our cable internet output continues shading up,\n",
            "[00:03:00,340 --> 00:03:08,340]  with high-speed subscriber mix rising to 25% in September versus 7% a year ago.\n",

            "[00:03:26,590 --> 00:03:35,590]  On a worldwide comparison, stripping out the one-off reversal of over-accrued expenses in third quarter last year,\n",
            "[00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:41,590]  our consolidated EBITDA grew by 2.4% from a year ago,\n",
            "[00:03:41,590 --> 00:03:48,590]  contributed by a service revenue growth of 3% in the third quarter this year,\n",
            "[00:03:48,590 --> 00:03:55,590]  excluding the above-mentioned one-off adjustment and impairment loss on Taiwan high-speed rail\n",
            "[00:03:55,590 --> 00:03:58,590]  growth in the third quarter last year.\n",
            "[00:03:58,590 --> 00:04:04,620]  The recurring net income was up by 4.7% worldwide.\n",
            "[00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:14,660]  In the third quarter year 2012, service revenue was lower than our guidance due to prepaid competition.\n",
            "[00:04:14,660 --> 00:04:24,660]  Nevertheless, both CBG and EBG outperformed its respective profit targets, credited to better OPEX control.\n",
            "[00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:31,660]  This helped to alleviate pressure from Momo's black-luster contribution.\n",
            "[00:04:31,660 --> 00:04:41,850]  The non-operating expense also came in less than guidance, due mainly to lower-than-expected assets' right-of-losses.\n",
            "[00:04:41,850 --> 00:04:47,850]  As such, our third quarter net profit was better than forecasted.\n",
            "[00:04:47,850 --> 00:04:59,010]  For the first three quarters of this year, our EPS came in at $4.16 NTD,\n",
            "[00:04:59,010 --> 00:05:10,170]  up 20% worldwide and reaching 78% of our full-year target of $5.34.\n",

            "[00:05:15,420 --> 00:05:23,420]  Adjusted for the one-time over-accrued expenses reversal met in the third quarter last year,\n",
            "[00:05:23,420 --> 00:05:28,420]  CBG's third quarter EBITDA was slashed from a year ago.\n",
            "[00:05:28,420 --> 00:05:35,420]  Enterprise customers' mobile service revenue rose YOY in the third quarter of this year,\n",
            "[00:05:35,420 --> 00:05:41,420]  credited to a rise in the number of subscribers and higher smartphone adoption.\n",
            "[00:05:41,420 --> 00:05:49,450]  HBG posted a stable profit increase from better economic upscale in broadband business\n",
            "[00:05:49,450 --> 00:05:55,450]  and a higher blended output as a result of selling more services per household.\n",
            "[00:05:55,450 --> 00:06:02,450]  Despite a 49% YOY increase in EBITDA for the online shopping business,\n",
            "[00:06:02,450 --> 00:06:10,450]  MoMo had margin erosions due to declining profit contributions from its TV home shopping business.\n",

            "[00:10:38,060 --> 00:10:41,060]  Our first question comes from Trade Band of Credit Suisse Hong Kong.\n",

            "[00:10:43,540 --> 00:10:44,540]  Good afternoon, guys.\n",

            "[00:10:49,540 --> 00:10:51,540]  Today, I have four questions.\n",
            "[00:10:51,540 --> 00:10:54,540]  The first question is related to MOMO.\n",
            "[00:10:54,540 --> 00:10:57,580]  It seems like the margin is not picking up.\n",
            "[00:10:57,580 --> 00:11:01,580]  Where do you see the turning point for MOMO business?\n",
            "[00:11:01,580 --> 00:11:06,740]  What would need to happen for them to actually achieve a turnaround in terms of margins?\n",
            "[00:11:06,740 --> 00:11:09,740]  The second question is related to the mobile data growth.\n",
            "[00:11:09,740 --> 00:11:14,740]  It seems like it's decelerating, partly because it's a higher base as well.\n",
            "[00:11:14,740 --> 00:11:19,740]  My question is what kind of incremental Apple you are generating from a new smartphone user?\n",
            "[00:11:19,740 --> 00:11:26,900]  Basically, what kind of Apple are you generating on a new smartphone subscriber you get right now?\n",
            "[00:11:26,900 --> 00:11:29,930]  The third question is related to CapEx.\n",
            "[00:11:29,930 --> 00:11:32,930]  It seems like you are running behind us, as you suggest,\n",
            "[00:11:32,930 --> 00:11:36,930]  but I guess for the full year, are you still expecting to spend $11.8 billion,\n",
            "[00:11:36,930 --> 00:11:39,930]  or is there some delay into next year?\n",
            "[00:11:40,930 --> 00:11:45,930]  For next year, CapEx should be closer to $9 billion, now that IDC CapEx is spent.\n",
            "[00:11:45,930 --> 00:11:51,930]  The fourth point is just to clarify your statement about reaching the bottom-line guidance.\n",
            "[00:11:51,930 --> 00:11:54,930]  Are you talking about achieving the bottom-line guidance alone,\n",
            "[00:11:54,930 --> 00:11:57,930]  because it still looks a little bit light on EBITDA right now,\n",
            "[00:11:57,930 --> 00:12:01,930]  and given the subsidies coming from some certain high-profile smartphones that you say\n",
            "[00:12:01,930 --> 00:12:06,930]  would make achieving EBITDA guidance quite challenging in the fourth quarter.\n",
            "[00:12:06,930 --> 00:12:14,590]  Is that right? Thank you.\n",
            "[00:12:19,460 --> 00:12:27,460]  Regarding the MOMO, I think currently the economy situation in Taiwan is not very good.\n",
            "[00:12:27,460 --> 00:12:37,460]  It's part of the reasons why TV shopping is not performing to the expectation we would like to have.\n",
            "[00:12:37,460 --> 00:12:44,350]  But MOMO is undergoing certain turnaround strategy.\n",
            "[00:12:44,350 --> 00:12:53,830]  I think this transformation and turnaround strategy requires at least a quarter to show certain results.\n",
            "[00:12:53,830 --> 00:13:02,570]  We would like to see things can improve gradually in the fourth quarter,\n",
            "[00:13:02,570 --> 00:13:06,570]  and may have more significant improvement in the next year.\n",
            "[00:13:08,940 --> 00:13:17,940]  As for data APU, I mentioned that even now we are selling more and more middle and lower-end smartphones.\n",
            "[00:13:17,940 --> 00:13:28,940]  So the data APU dropped a little bit, but currently it still averages roughly 180% higher than the feature phone APU.\n",
            "[00:13:28,940 --> 00:13:37,320]  Regarding the CapEx, even though we are running behind in our CapEx spending,\n",
            "[00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:45,480]  but as we explained in the presentation, we do expect that by the end of this year,\n",
            "[00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:51,480]  we are going to spend all the CapEx, which is budgeted,\n",
            "[00:13:51,480 --> 00:14:00,480]  because the IBC and the 3G data network upgrade mostly will happen in the fourth quarter.\n",
            "[00:14:02,790 --> 00:14:11,790]  And as for the EPDAX, even though we are expecting iPhone 5 to launch in the fourth quarter,\n",
            "[00:14:11,790 --> 00:14:20,790]  but we are very confident that we are going to still be able to achieve the whole-year guidance eventually.\n",
            "[00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:24,330]  Thank you very much.\n",
            "[00:14:24,330 --> 00:14:30,330]  Just a follow-up regarding the question about APU from mid and lower-end smartphones.\n",
            "[00:14:30,330 --> 00:14:35,330]  The number you disclosed, 1,400 for APU, is on a blended basis, right?\n",
            "[00:14:35,330 --> 00:14:41,330]  What would be the APU if we just look at the medium and lower-end smartphones that you are selling?\n",
            "[00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:59,120]  Well, if we look at the data APU, then data APU is still showing a year-on-year increase by roughly 8%.\n",
            "[00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:02,970]  Okay, thank you.\n",
            "[00:15:02,970 --> 00:15:05,970]  Just one last question regarding CapEx.\n",
            "[00:15:05,970 --> 00:15:10,970]  So after we adjust out the IDC, the next year CapEx should go down to around $9 billion, right?\n",
            "[00:15:10,970 --> 00:15:17,970]  Or is there any further one-time that you see at the current moment that would come in next year as well?\n",
            "[00:15:17,970 --> 00:15:23,180]  We are still doing our budget exercise.\n",
            "[00:15:23,180 --> 00:15:31,040]  Regarding the IDC, because that part of it is our fixed line business.\n",
            "[00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:39,230]  So we won't see a big item like IDC in the next year's fixed line budget.\n",
            "[00:15:39,230 --> 00:15:44,260]  But regarding the mobile side, we are still calculating.\n",
            "[00:15:44,260 --> 00:15:50,870]  So in the fixed line side, I think the budget will be lower than this year.\n",
            "[00:15:50,870 --> 00:15:58,870]  In the mobile side, we are still doing more investigation regarding the budget for the next year.\n",
            "[00:15:58,870 --> 00:16:01,030]  Okay, that is perfect. Thank you very much.\n",
            "[00:16:02,030 --> 00:16:03,030]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:16:03,030 --> 00:16:06,030]  Our next question comes from Stephen Liu of Standard Chartered Hong Kong.\n",
            "[00:16:06,030 --> 00:16:07,030]  Please go ahead.\n",
            "[00:16:07,030 --> 00:16:08,030]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:16:08,030 --> 00:16:09,030]  I have two questions.\n",
            "[00:16:09,030 --> 00:16:18,030]  Regarding your smartphone APU, you blended yesterday to 1,400.\n",
            "[00:16:18,030 --> 00:16:22,030]  That implies only 1,200 in the third quarter.\n",
            "[00:16:22,030 --> 00:16:27,030]  So I think maybe the main reason is due to the low-end smartphone user.\n",
            "[00:16:28,030 --> 00:16:40,030]  So would you see the smartphone APU to continue to go down in the coming few quarters due to the higher low-end subscriber?\n",
            "[00:16:40,030 --> 00:16:41,030]  First question.\n",
            "[00:16:41,030 --> 00:16:54,510]  Well, to be frank, we didn't look very much into this.\n",
            "[00:16:55,510 --> 00:17:05,540]  Because in the coming quarter, at the moment, the blended out, we still see we are selling a lot of high-end products.\n",
            "[00:17:05,540 --> 00:17:12,540]  Because we have this iPhone 5 and the Samsung Galaxy 3 and Samsung Note 2.\n",
            "[00:17:12,540 --> 00:17:14,540]  They are all selling very well.\n",
            "[00:17:15,540 --> 00:17:32,250]  So we have to really look at another quarter or two to determine whether this low-end smartphone will really affect our APU and to what degree.\n",
            "[00:17:32,250 --> 00:17:36,470]  So I don't know the answer at the moment.\n",
            "[00:17:36,470 --> 00:17:37,470]  Okay.\n",
            "[00:17:37,470 --> 00:17:40,470]  So what is the range of smartphone APU?\n",
            "[00:17:40,470 --> 00:17:43,470]  I mean your average is 1,400.\n",
            "[00:17:43,470 --> 00:17:44,470]  What is the range?\n",
            "[00:17:44,470 --> 00:17:49,470]  It's from like 900 to 2,200 or something.\n",
            "[00:17:49,470 --> 00:17:50,470]  What is the range?\n",
            "[00:17:50,470 --> 00:17:54,470]  I mean average range generally, smartphone APU.\n",
            "[00:17:54,470 --> 00:18:02,660]  The smartphone APU can be from 7,800 to more than 2,000.\n",
            "[00:18:02,660 --> 00:18:04,660]  Okay, okay.\n",
            "[00:18:04,660 --> 00:18:05,660]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:18:05,660 --> 00:18:09,660]  And the second question is regarding your cable broadband.\n",
            "[00:18:09,660 --> 00:18:15,660]  As you see in your slide, there are only 35% broadband user.\n",
            "[00:18:15,660 --> 00:18:18,660]  I mean the connection speed is higher than 20 Mbps.\n",
            "[00:18:18,660 --> 00:18:23,660]  And we know Chunhua has been upgrading the fiber to achieve 100 Mbps.\n",
            "[00:18:23,660 --> 00:18:33,140]  So technology, can you upgrade to like 100 Mbps broadband connection speed going forward?\n",
            "[00:18:33,140 --> 00:18:34,140]  Yes.\n",
            "[00:18:34,140 --> 00:18:40,140]  Actually, we are providing 100 Mbps service just like CHT.\n",
            "[00:18:40,140 --> 00:18:45,300]  And we are aggressively pursuing high-end user too.\n",
            "[00:18:45,300 --> 00:18:55,300]  So in the coming quarters, you will see that the mix of high-end, high-speed broadband user will increase quarter by quarter.\n",
            "[00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:57,980]  And what is your target penetration?\n",
            "[00:18:57,980 --> 00:19:03,980]  I mean the 20 Mbps subscriber penetration by end of the year and by end of next year.\n",
            "[00:19:03,980 --> 00:19:05,980]  Now it's 25%.\n",
            "[00:19:05,980 --> 00:19:07,980]  What is your target penetration?\n",
            "[00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:20,140]  I don't think at the moment we have a target.\n",
            "[00:19:20,140 --> 00:19:23,140]  For this kind of number, we have a target penetration.\n",
            "[00:19:23,140 --> 00:19:29,130]  As a matter of fact, we just try to sell as many as we can.\n",
            "[00:19:32,340 --> 00:19:33,340]  Okay, thank you.\n",
            "[00:19:33,340 --> 00:19:36,290]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:19:36,290 --> 00:19:40,290]  Once again, ladies and gentlemen, if you'd like to register for a question, please press star 1 key now.\n",
            "[00:19:40,290 --> 00:19:41,290]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:19:41,290 --> 00:19:51,080]  Next, we have a follow-up question from Tradeband of Credit Suisse.\n",
            "[00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:52,080]  Please go ahead.\n",
            "[00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:53,430]  Okay, sorry guys.\n",
            "[00:19:53,430 --> 00:19:55,430]  Just one follow-up question from me.\n",
            "[00:19:55,430 --> 00:20:02,430]  On the 4G side, what's the latest in terms of the 4G progress right now?\n",
            "[00:20:02,430 --> 00:20:07,430]  Do we see any details in terms of how it's going to be and what the pricing is going to be?\n",
            "[00:20:07,430 --> 00:20:09,810]  No.\n",
            "[00:20:09,810 --> 00:20:18,810]  As a matter of fact, we haven't heard anything from NCC other than that they say that they're going to have this license awarded by the end of the next year.\n",
            "[00:20:18,810 --> 00:20:24,160]  No pricing, no any detail at the moment.\n",
            "[00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:25,510]  Okay.\n",
            "[00:20:25,510 --> 00:20:29,510]  On your side, any expectation in terms of what kind of pricing are you expecting?\n",
            "[00:20:29,510 --> 00:20:34,510]  And if the price is high, would that affect your dividend payout?\n",
            "[00:20:34,510 --> 00:20:35,510]  Are you ready to gear up?\n",
            "[00:20:35,510 --> 00:20:36,510]  Any guidance on that front?\n",
            "[00:20:37,990 --> 00:20:52,020]  Well, we have some idea regarding the pricing, but at this moment, I don't think we should disclose what we think.\n",
            "[00:20:52,020 --> 00:21:01,280]  And whether this is going to affect our dividend, I think it's so far away, so I won't comment on that.\n",
            "[00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:03,980]  Okay, noted.\n",
            "[00:21:03,980 --> 00:21:04,980]  And thank you very much.\n",
            "[00:21:04,980 --> 00:21:09,980]  Just one other thing on regulatory side, any progress in terms of tier pricing discussion with NCC?\n",
            "[00:21:09,980 --> 00:21:23,460]  We are continuing to have dialogue with NCC, but as you know, the new chairman and the commissioner just joined NCC.\n",
            "[00:21:23,460 --> 00:21:34,490]  And at the moment, they are busy working on the 4G, and they also have opened up the cable network area.\n",
            "[00:21:34,490 --> 00:21:41,900]  And they are also working on the extension of the 2G license.\n",
            "[00:21:41,900 --> 00:21:55,180]  So I think this tier pricing will not happen in this year, and our expectation is that if something like that will happen, it's going to.\n",
            "[00:21:55,180 --> 00:21:56,180]  Perfect, thank you very much.\n",
            "[00:21:56,180 --> 00:21:58,870]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:21:58,870 --> 00:22:01,870]  Our next question comes from Joseph Queen of Macquarie, Taiwan.\n",
            "[00:22:01,870 --> 00:22:02,870]  Please go ahead.\n",
            "[00:22:02,870 --> 00:22:06,900]  Hi, thanks very much for the opportunity to ask some questions.\n",
            "[00:22:06,900 --> 00:22:09,900]  I have two major questions I hope you can help with.\n",
            "[00:22:09,900 --> 00:22:18,900]  The first one is actually surrounding some news that's been out over the last two days in relation to comments from the Taipei mayor on cutting cable rates.\n",
            "[00:22:18,900 --> 00:22:27,900]  So just curious, what do you believe, is there any maybe other risks to cable rates in other areas of Taiwan that you're exposed to?\n",
            "[00:22:27,900 --> 00:22:29,900]  That's the first question.\n",
            "[00:22:29,900 --> 00:22:33,900]  The second one is just around the corporate bond that you're raising.\n",
            "[00:22:33,900 --> 00:22:37,900]  Can you give us some indication of what that money is most likely to be for?\n",
            "[00:22:37,900 --> 00:22:42,900]  Is it more towards 4G licenses, if that's a practical explanation?\n",
            "[00:22:42,900 --> 00:22:47,900]  And just on the last slide, you did mention in the last comment about 3G license extensions.\n",
            "[00:22:47,900 --> 00:22:55,900]  Can you give us some more color on what you're expecting in terms of how long the 3G licenses may be extended to,\n",
            "[00:22:55,900 --> 00:23:00,900]  and also in terms of has there been a final decision on the 2G license extension to?\n",
            "[00:23:00,900 --> 00:23:01,900]  Thanks.\n",
            "[00:23:01,900 --> 00:23:11,830]  Regarding the mayor's comment, most likely this is going to affect the Taipei city.\n",
            "[00:23:11,830 --> 00:23:19,830]  And we don't have any presence in the Taipei city, but we do have three SOs in the new Taipei city.\n",
            "[00:23:19,830 --> 00:23:26,060]  And the decision made by the Taipei city will affect new Taipei city,\n",
            "[00:23:26,060 --> 00:23:32,060]  because I think in the past, Taipei and the new Taipei city, they worked together.\n",
            "[00:23:32,060 --> 00:23:38,060]  So if there's a cut in Taipei, it's going to affect the rate in new Taipei city.\n",
            "[00:23:38,060 --> 00:23:43,600]  And currently, we don't have any 3G extensions.\n",
            "[00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:53,600]  What I mentioned is that we have a 2G extension, because by the end of this year, our 2G license will expire.\n",
            "[00:23:53,600 --> 00:24:00,700]  So we are going through process to renew our 2G license for another five years.\n",
            "[00:24:00,700 --> 00:24:06,700]  And we are scheduled to interview with NCC in this coming Friday.\n",
            "[00:24:06,700 --> 00:24:13,700]  I mean tomorrow, I'm going to NCC for an interview to extend our license.\n",
            "[00:24:13,700 --> 00:24:25,240]  If they approve, if we go through this interview, the NCC will extend our 2G license for another five years.\n",
            "[00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:30,240]  As for the bond issue, let me turn to Rosie.\n",
            "[00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:38,530]  Yeah, you know, from the balance sheet, you can easily tell that we have $8 billion in corporate bonds.\n",
            "[00:24:38,530 --> 00:24:48,530]  And half of that will become due in November this year, and the rest will become due next year.\n",
            "[00:24:48,530 --> 00:25:05,530]  So no more than $16 billion new trade bond issuance is first to refinance the repayment of the existing corporate bonds.\n",
            "[00:25:05,530 --> 00:25:23,580]  Secondly is to strengthen our financial condition to have a better allocation of short-term and long-term borrowing to prepare for our future funding needs.\n",
            "[00:25:23,580 --> 00:25:25,580]  Thanks. That's very helpful on the corporate bonds.\n",
            "[00:25:25,580 --> 00:25:29,580]  Sorry, just a follow-up, Cliff, on the 2G extension.\n",
            "[00:25:29,580 --> 00:25:32,580]  So you said that you are looking to extend it for five years.\n",
            "[00:25:32,580 --> 00:25:37,580]  Do you think there's any possibility that they may negotiate that down for a shorter period?\n",
            "[00:25:37,580 --> 00:25:43,580]  And just, it's more a reflection of the fact that obviously if you get extended for five years,\n",
            "[00:25:43,580 --> 00:25:49,580]  it limits maybe the opportunities for someone else to bid on it for LTE size.\n",
            "[00:25:49,580 --> 00:25:51,580]  So I'm just kind of curious on that side of things.\n",
            "[00:25:52,680 --> 00:25:56,840]  Yeah, it's possible that we don't know yet.\n",
            "[00:25:56,840 --> 00:26:07,990]  Because tomorrow, the three major, like CHT, FET, and Power Mobile, are all going to NCC for this interview.\n",
            "[00:26:07,990 --> 00:26:13,220]  So the original framework is for five years extension.\n",
            "[00:26:13,220 --> 00:26:20,440]  But after the interview, they will tell us how many years we get.\n",
            "[00:26:20,440 --> 00:26:26,440]  So at this moment, we don't know what would be their decision.\n",
            "[00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:32,920]  I assume obviously you would prefer it to be a five-year extension.\n",
            "[00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:34,850]  Excuse me?\n",
            "[00:26:34,850 --> 00:26:39,850]  I assume that you would prefer a five-year extension so you can maintain the use of that spectrum.\n",
            "[00:26:41,070 --> 00:26:50,070]  Well, you put me in a very awkward position because I have to say we expect five years extension.\n",
            "[00:26:51,620 --> 00:26:54,620]  Because we are going to have an interview tomorrow.\n",
            "[00:26:54,620 --> 00:26:58,620]  I don't want NCC to listen in our analyst meeting.\n",
            "[00:27:00,620 --> 00:27:04,620]  I'm sure they're quite busy. They'll wait for my notes later. It's okay.\n",
            "[00:27:06,620 --> 00:27:09,060]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:27:09,060 --> 00:27:14,060]  Thank you. Next we have a follow-up question from Stephen Liu of Standard China Hong Kong. Please go ahead.\n",
            "[00:27:14,060 --> 00:27:17,060]  Thank you. I have two more follow-up questions.\n",
            "[00:27:17,060 --> 00:27:19,060]  I have a question still on the MOMO.\n",
            "[00:27:19,060 --> 00:27:25,060]  Do you have a target EBITDA margin going forward or any guidance on the revenue growth?\n",
            "[00:27:25,060 --> 00:27:29,060]  We have seen very stagnant growth in the past few quarters on the MOMO.\n",
            "[00:27:29,060 --> 00:27:34,060]  So what is the target revenue growth guidance and EBITDA margin going forward, stabilizing?\n",
            "[00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:46,360]  I think at this moment, we don't have a target for this.\n",
            "[00:27:46,360 --> 00:27:51,360]  Of course, this year their results have been very disappointing.\n",
            "[00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:57,360]  And they are taking some actions to remedy the situation.\n",
            "[00:27:57,360 --> 00:28:06,360]  And as Cliff mentioned that we have to give them some time to show the results.\n",
            "[00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:14,360]  I don't know whether you've noticed that their Internet business has been doing very well.\n",
            "[00:28:14,360 --> 00:28:23,360]  And EBITDA margin has actually gone up by one percentage point or slightly more.\n",
            "[00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:31,360]  But their TV shopping business has been on the decline due to the weaker than expected economic conditions.\n",
            "[00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:36,360]  And the reason for that is quite clear.\n",
            "[00:28:36,360 --> 00:28:43,360]  It's because the items sold on the TV are mostly discretionary items.\n",
            "[00:28:43,360 --> 00:29:02,000]  And also, they generated quite a lot of profits from some dietary supplements that are more profitable than current product mix.\n",
            "[00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:13,540]  But after the crackdown from the government on these types of products, their profitability has been going down.\n",
            "[00:29:13,540 --> 00:29:31,580]  So what they are trying to do is to help those vendors of dietary supplements or other more profitable items to get legal approval for sale on TV.\n",
            "[00:29:31,580 --> 00:29:39,580]  I tend to say that these are not behavior change.\n",
            "[00:29:39,580 --> 00:29:47,580]  This could be affected seriously by the weaker than expected economic conditions.\n",
            "[00:29:47,580 --> 00:29:50,610]  So we don't have a target on their margin.\n",
            "[00:29:50,610 --> 00:29:51,700]  Okay, thank you.\n",
            "[00:29:51,700 --> 00:29:55,700]  And the second question regarding your 3G utilization.\n",
            "[00:29:55,700 --> 00:29:59,700]  Can you give roughly the utilization?\n",
            "[00:30:00,700 --> 00:30:06,340]  I mean 50 or 70 percent, something like that.\n",
            "[00:30:06,340 --> 00:30:08,340]  It's below 80 percent.\n",
            "[00:30:08,340 --> 00:30:11,940]  Okay, thank you.\n",
            "[00:30:11,940 --> 00:30:12,940]  Some more questions.\n",
            "[00:30:12,940 --> 00:30:15,260]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:30:15,260 --> 00:30:19,260]  Next, we have a follow-up question from Mr. Chai-Chi-Pan of Credit Suisse.\n",
            "[00:30:19,260 --> 00:30:20,260]  Please go ahead.\n",
            "[00:30:20,260 --> 00:30:21,260]  I apologize.\n",
            "[00:30:21,260 --> 00:30:23,260]  We have a post of questions again.\n",
            "[00:30:23,260 --> 00:30:27,260]  Just a follow-up to my peers' questions on MOMO.\n",
            "[00:30:28,260 --> 00:30:33,260]  You mentioned about the Internet revenue, the EBITDA margin on the Internet side improved.\n",
            "[00:30:33,260 --> 00:30:40,260]  Can you give us some color on what kind of margin is generating on the TV shopping site versus the Internet shopping site?\n",
            "[00:30:40,260 --> 00:30:45,260]  TV shopping EBITDA margin is about 6 percent.\n",
            "[00:30:45,260 --> 00:30:49,260]  Internet shopping is also close to that number.\n",
            "[00:30:49,260 --> 00:30:53,760]  Okay, but I guess the Internet used to be much lower.\n",
            "[00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:58,760]  This is basically an improvement whereas TV used to be higher and is coming down?\n",
            "[00:30:58,760 --> 00:31:02,890]  For TV shopping, it's coming down quite a lot.\n",
            "[00:31:02,890 --> 00:31:08,890]  For Internet shopping, it's up by about more than 1 percentage point.\n",
            "[00:31:08,890 --> 00:31:09,890]  Right.\n",
            "[00:31:09,890 --> 00:31:13,890]  You have some color on where it used to be, the TV home shopping?\n",
            "[00:31:13,890 --> 00:31:21,210]  It was about 8 to 10 percent one or two years ago.\n",
            "[00:31:21,210 --> 00:31:22,210]  All right.\n",
            "[00:31:22,210 --> 00:31:23,210]  That is perfect.\n",
            "[00:31:23,210 --> 00:31:26,210]  Another thing regarding your handset sales guidance.\n",
            "[00:31:26,210 --> 00:31:31,210]  It seems like 9 months is 56 percent, so it's much lower than what you're expecting.\n",
            "[00:31:31,210 --> 00:31:36,300]  Can you give us some color on why that is and where we should expect it to be for 4 years?\n",
            "[00:31:36,300 --> 00:31:38,300]  You mean for handset sales revenue?\n",
            "[00:31:38,300 --> 00:31:39,400]  Handset sales revenue.\n",
            "[00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:41,400]  Oh, handset sales revenue.\n",
            "[00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:50,200]  The handset sales revenue is lower than expected.\n",
            "[00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:55,840]  This really doesn't affect our profit too much.\n",
            "[00:31:55,840 --> 00:31:56,840]  Yes.\n",
            "[00:31:56,840 --> 00:32:03,840]  Last year, we started selling unbundled handsets in our shop.\n",
            "[00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:12,840]  For this year, we have projected a higher sales number for unbundled handset sales.\n",
            "[00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:17,870]  For those sales, the market is quite low, but we try to increase the traffic.\n",
            "[00:32:18,870 --> 00:32:24,870]  Unfortunately, we didn't sell as many unbundled handsets as we would like to have.\n",
            "[00:32:24,870 --> 00:32:33,870]  This is the reason why the sales revenue of our handset sales is below our expectation.\n",
            "[00:32:33,870 --> 00:32:41,870]  However, it really doesn't have any significant impact on our bottom line.\n",
            "[00:32:41,870 --> 00:32:43,800]  Well understood.\n",
            "[00:32:43,800 --> 00:32:44,800]  Thank you very much.\n",
            "[00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:47,370]  Thank you.\n",

            "[00:32:53,040 --> 00:32:55,040]  Thanks for the management.\n",
            "[00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:57,040]  I have just one question.\n",
            "[00:32:57,040 --> 00:33:05,040]  Would you describe how you expect the competition will go in the next three to six months?\n",
            "[00:33:05,040 --> 00:33:13,190]  Is it going to be more intensified or is it going to be like status quo?\n",
            "[00:33:13,190 --> 00:33:18,190]  For the next three to six months, I think it's more status quo.\n",
            "[00:33:18,190 --> 00:33:27,610]  Very similar to what we have experienced in the last two quarters.\n",
            "[00:33:27,610 --> 00:33:28,610]  Yes.\n",
            "[00:33:28,610 --> 00:33:33,540]  Okay, thanks.\n",

            "[00:33:46,920 --> 00:33:48,020]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:33:48,020 --> 00:33:50,020]  Sorry, just a follow-up.\n",
            "[00:33:50,020 --> 00:33:55,020]  You had mentioned earlier in the year some updates in relation to your stores,\n",
            "[00:33:55,020 --> 00:33:57,020]  increasing your number of cell phone stores.\n",
            "[00:33:57,020 --> 00:34:01,020]  Could you possibly give an update on how that's progressing at this stage?\n",
            "[00:34:01,020 --> 00:34:03,020]  That would be very helpful.\n",
            "[00:34:03,020 --> 00:34:05,500]  Thanks.\n",
            "[00:34:05,500 --> 00:34:15,650]  The target we have is that by the end of this year, we are going to have 400.\n",
            "[00:34:15,650 --> 00:34:19,680]  Just at this stage, where are we at the moment?\n",
            "[00:34:19,680 --> 00:34:24,180]  We are roughly at 385.\n",
            "[00:34:24,180 --> 00:34:27,180]  So you're confident that we'll hit that 400 number?\n",
            "[00:34:27,180 --> 00:34:28,180]  Yes, yes.\n",
            "[00:34:28,180 --> 00:34:30,410]  We are going to hit the 400 by the end of this year.\n",

            "[00:34:33,660 --> 00:34:34,660]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:34:34,660 --> 00:34:37,660]  Next question comes from Leo Anderson of HSBC, Hong Kong.\n",
            "[00:34:37,660 --> 00:34:39,070]  Please go ahead.\n",
            "[00:34:39,070 --> 00:34:40,070]  Hi there.\n",
            "[00:34:40,070 --> 00:34:44,070]  I just had a question about your more recent smartphone subscribers.\n",
            "[00:34:44,070 --> 00:34:51,070]  So you said you've been selling more mid-range and value smartphones in the quarter.\n",
            "[00:34:51,070 --> 00:34:55,070]  Are you able to say what are those customers spending\n",
            "[00:34:55,070 --> 00:34:59,070]  compared to their previous feature phone-based spending?\n",
            "[00:34:59,070 --> 00:35:03,070]  I presume it's a narrower or a smaller increase.\n",
            "[00:35:03,070 --> 00:35:08,060]  I'd be very interested in your comments on that.\n",
            "[00:35:08,060 --> 00:35:29,660]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:35:29,660 --> 00:35:40,100]  In general, it's more than 60% more than they used to have.\n",
            "[00:35:40,100 --> 00:35:42,670]  Right.\n",
            "[00:35:42,670 --> 00:35:44,670]  So it's still a very large increase.\n",
            "[00:35:44,670 --> 00:35:50,670]  How long do you expect that trend to continue in terms of that level of increase?\n",
            "[00:35:50,670 --> 00:35:53,670]  I think you've said before that the smartphone adoption rate\n",
            "[00:35:53,670 --> 00:35:57,830]  should be fairly steady at around a percentage point a month.\n",
            "[00:35:57,830 --> 00:36:03,830]  In terms of that 60% increase, how do you see that trending?\n",
            "[00:36:03,830 --> 00:36:07,830]  Well, I think this will continue in the next year.\n",
            "[00:36:08,830 --> 00:36:14,180]  Because our current smartphone penetration is still only 35%.\n",
            "[00:36:14,180 --> 00:36:20,180]  Recently, we have launched Amazing 2 smartphone,\n",
            "[00:36:20,180 --> 00:36:25,340]  which is a dual-port, 4-inch smartphone,\n",
            "[00:36:25,340 --> 00:36:35,050]  which costs only $160 for unbundled.\n",
            "[00:36:35,050 --> 00:36:41,050]  Unbundled means that it only costs $160 for a consumer.\n",
            "[00:36:41,050 --> 00:36:47,460]  Now, the low-end smartphone, the performance is very good.\n",
            "[00:36:47,460 --> 00:36:51,460]  It's almost like the high-end phone a year or a year and a half ago.\n",
            "[00:36:51,460 --> 00:36:56,460]  So we expect that the penetration rate of the smartphone\n",
            "[00:36:56,460 --> 00:37:01,460]  will increase at the current level until the end of the next year.\n",
            "[00:37:01,460 --> 00:37:04,220]  Right. Thank you.\n",
            "[00:37:04,220 --> 00:37:07,220]  Sorry, just one final question on the traffic,\n",
            "[00:37:07,220 --> 00:37:11,220]  the data usage of these newer, more recent smartphone customers.\n",
            "[00:37:11,220 --> 00:37:16,220]  Is that similar to what you're seeing with high-end Android\n",
            "[00:37:16,220 --> 00:37:19,260]  and iPhone-type handsets?\n",
            "[00:37:20,260 --> 00:37:23,260]  No, not really, because the output is different.\n",
            "[00:37:23,260 --> 00:37:27,260]  Because the low-end smartphone users, on average,\n",
            "[00:37:27,260 --> 00:37:32,260]  their lower percentage will choose,\n",
            "[00:37:32,260 --> 00:37:37,260]  a smaller percentage will choose all-you-can-eat tariffs.\n",
            "[00:37:37,260 --> 00:37:43,260]  But certain will choose $250 NT monthly service.\n",
            "[00:37:43,260 --> 00:37:45,260]  So some will choose $100.\n",
            "[00:37:46,260 --> 00:37:48,260]  So there's a different mix.\n",
            "[00:37:48,260 --> 00:37:53,260]  But for high-end users, maybe high-end smartphone users,\n",
            "[00:37:53,260 --> 00:37:57,260]  maybe over 70% will choose data package,\n",
            "[00:37:57,260 --> 00:38:00,260]  which gives you all-you-can-eat data plan.\n",
            "[00:38:00,260 --> 00:38:04,310]  So that's the difference.\n",
            "[00:38:04,310 --> 00:38:06,880]  Thank you very much.\n",
            "[00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:10,090]  Thank you.\n",

            "[00:38:16,250 --> 00:38:18,250]  I have one follow-up question.\n",
            "[00:38:18,250 --> 00:38:21,250]  How many retail shops do you have in Taiwan?\n",
            "[00:38:21,250 --> 00:38:25,250]  And how is the number compared with Chunhua and Firestone?\n",
            "[00:38:25,250 --> 00:38:41,020]  Well, currently we have around 800 retail stores\n",
            "[00:38:41,020 --> 00:38:45,020]  carrying Taiwan Mobile's brand name.\n",
            "[00:38:45,020 --> 00:38:51,180]  And FET has roughly 700.\n",
            "[00:38:51,180 --> 00:39:00,340]  But FET also controls a franchise store, roughly 150 stores,\n",

            "[00:39:06,530 --> 00:39:12,750]  So in total, FET has roughly 850 stores under their control.\n",
            "[00:39:13,910 --> 00:39:30,470]  And the CHT has roughly 410 stores directly owned.\n",
            "[00:39:30,470 --> 00:39:34,470]  But they also have 220 stores under their control,\n",

            "[00:39:38,470 --> 00:39:42,470]  And the 150 stores owned by the FET under their control\n",
            "[00:39:42,470 --> 00:39:45,470]  but carry different names.\n",
            "[00:39:45,470 --> 00:39:49,780]  So we have 800.\n",

            "[00:40:11,780 --> 00:40:14,780]  and 220 carrying their Standout brand name.\n",
            "[00:40:14,780 --> 00:40:23,400]  So the 800 all carry Taiwan Mobile's brand name?\n",

            "[00:42:50,650 --> 00:42:52,650]  if you'd like to register for a question,\n",

            "[00:43:07,260 --> 00:43:08,260]  Excuse me.\n",
            "[00:43:08,260 --> 00:43:10,260]  There seems to be no further questions at this point in time.\n",
            "[00:43:10,260 --> 00:43:11,260]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:43:11,260 --> 00:43:12,260]  No further questions?\n",
            "[00:43:12,260 --> 00:43:13,680]  Okay.\n",
            "[00:43:13,680 --> 00:43:17,680]  Thanks for attending this conference.\n",
            "[00:43:17,680 --> 00:43:20,780]  And wish you a happy weekend.\n",

            "[00:00:01,180 --> 00:00:10,180]  Hi, good morning, good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to the conference call. Our chairperson today is Mr. Cliff Lau and Ms. Rosie. Rosie, please begin your call and I'll be standing by. Thank you.\n",
            "[00:00:11,530 --> 00:00:12,530]  Hi, good afternoon.\n",
            "[00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:19,040]  Hi, good afternoon. Welcome to our 2012 second quarter conference call.\n",
            "[00:00:19,040 --> 00:00:50,820]  Before I start our presentation, I would like to direct your attention to our disclaimer page, which states the information contained in this presentation, including all forward-looking information, is subject to change without notice, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise, and Taiwan Mobile undertakes no obligation to update or revise the information contained in this presentation.\n",
            "[00:00:52,430 --> 00:01:11,460]  No representation or warranty, either expressed or implied, is provided in relation to the accuracy, completeness, or reliability of the information contained herein, nor is the information intended to be a complete statement of the company, market, or development referred to in this presentation.\n",
            "[00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:41,990]  Let's start with a business overview. In the next three slides, I would like to highlight our growth area, first on mobile business. Continued strong growth in wireless data revenue boosted mobile service revenue to increase by 6% worldwide in the second quarter. At the end of the second quarter, we have doubled our smartphone penetration to 31%. As a result, our mobile broadband revenue increased 65% worldwide in the quarter.\n",
            "[00:01:42,990 --> 00:01:57,750]  Please turn to the next page. For our smartphone strategy, apart from the 10 exclusive smartphone models we currently have, we also have around 35 smartphone and tablet products on the market.\n",
            "[00:01:57,750 --> 00:02:24,670]  In the second quarter, smartphone sales volume was up 50% from a year ago and accounted for 74% of total handsets sold, with mid- to lower-end products making up 45%. Year-to-date, smartphone users' output remained at nearly two times that of post-pays with stable payback period.\n",
            "[00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:43,600]  Please turn to the next page. As indicated in the table, our Internet subscriber number increased by 11% and DTV customer number growth by 79%, all higher than the 1% subscriber rise in NLTV services in the second quarter.\n",
            "[00:02:45,850 --> 00:02:59,200]  And our cable Internet Apple continued trading up with high-speed subscriber mix rose to 21% in June versus 1% a year ago.\n",
            "[00:03:01,770 --> 00:03:09,990]  Please turn to the next page. This page on new products and services we launched during the second quarter for your reference.\n",
            "[00:03:11,220 --> 00:03:14,220]  I will turn the mic to Vivian for our financial results.\n",
            "[00:03:15,220 --> 00:03:31,220]  For our financial results, Taiwan Mobile attained better operating leverage in the second quarter with service revenue YOY growth, more than offsetting the increased marketing expenses related to smartphone adoption.\n",
            "[00:03:32,220 --> 00:03:43,220]  In addition, we continue to benefit from savings of network and traffic costs. Therefore, we grew our consolidated EBITDA by 9% YOY.\n",
            "[00:03:44,310 --> 00:03:51,310]  In the second quarter, the combined service revenue of the three business groups achieved its guidance.\n",
            "[00:03:52,470 --> 00:04:00,470]  Negatively affected by weak spending sentiment, MoMo failed to live up to our expectations in the second quarter.\n",
            "[00:04:00,470 --> 00:04:09,700]  Having said that, the consolidated EBITDA still managed to meet its target attributed to expense discipline.\n",
            "[00:04:10,700 --> 00:04:22,020]  With EBITDA meeting the second quarter guidance plus higher than expected non-operating income, our second quarter net profit was better than forecasted.\n",
            "[00:04:22,020 --> 00:04:43,560]  For the first six months of this year, our EPS came in at $2.70, up 19% YOY and reaching 51% of our full year target of $5.35.\n",
            "[00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:57,170]  For our divisional performance by business groups, our CBG started seeing profitable YOY revenue growth in the second quarter.\n",
            "[00:04:58,170 --> 00:05:11,170]  And both CBG and EBG saw notable QOQ and YOY EBITDA increase on the back of accelerated revenue growth and consolidated controlled expenses.\n",
            "[00:05:11,170 --> 00:05:23,260]  HBC's profit increase came from better economics of scale and a higher blended APU than a result of selling more services to the same household.\n",
            "[00:05:24,260 --> 00:05:35,260]  Despite a steady increase in MoMo's online shopping business, its TV shopping business performance was less than satisfactory in the second quarter.\n",
            "[00:05:36,260 --> 00:05:41,300]  Let me turn the presentation over to Rosie for balance sheet and cash flow analysis.\n",
            "[00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:55,900]  On the balance sheet, on the asset front compared to a year ago, second quarter cash level was lower due to more repayment of short-term borrowing for the quarter.\n",
            "[00:05:56,900 --> 00:06:04,900]  And year-on-year increases in inventory and tangible assets arose from the inclusion of MoMo and growing smartphone sales.\n",
            "[00:06:04,900 --> 00:06:17,250]  Long-term investment decreased year-on-year due mainly to the impairment loss of our Taiwan High-Speed Rail investment made in the third quarter of last year.\n",
            "[00:06:18,250 --> 00:06:32,730]  If you look at liabilities and stakeholder equities, other current liabilities increased from a quarter ago because of the $13.9 billion dividend payable, which is scheduled to be paid on July 27.\n",
            "[00:06:32,730 --> 00:06:43,820]  And growth debt balance fell to $9.8 billion due to $3.77 billion short-term borrowing repayment in the second quarter.\n",
            "[00:06:44,820 --> 00:06:50,820]  As a result, our net debt further declined to $3.7 billion by end of the second quarter.\n",
            "[00:06:51,820 --> 00:07:02,050]  The $1.76 billion top-up of dividends reduced the balance of unappropriated earnings and special reserves.\n",
            "[00:07:03,050 --> 00:07:11,340]  On the ratio front, the reduction in short-term debt improved our net debt to EBITDA and net debt to equity ratio.\n",
            "[00:07:12,340 --> 00:07:18,560]  In the third quarter, we expect to gear up again to finance the dividend payment.\n",
            "[00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:23,230]  Let's turn to the next page for cash flow analysis.\n",
            "[00:07:24,230 --> 00:07:33,160]  Our operating cash inflows for the quarter increased sequentially primarily due to a rise in net income.\n",
            "[00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:41,160]  Net investing cash outflow in the second quarter was primarily for the $1.68 billion in cash cutback.\n",
            "[00:07:42,830 --> 00:07:51,830]  The $3.77 billion short-term borrowing repayment was the main cash outflow for financing activities during the quarter.\n",
            "[00:07:53,890 --> 00:07:58,890]  Cash cutbacks in the first half totaled $3.42 billion.\n",
            "[00:07:59,890 --> 00:08:09,980]  We estimate group cutbacks to be more back-and-loaded as the majority of IDC construction and 3G expansion payments will be made in the second half.\n",
            "[00:08:09,980 --> 00:08:17,270]  First half free cash flow netted $8 billion, translating into an annualized yield of 6%.\n",
            "[00:08:18,270 --> 00:08:28,750]  Today, the Board approved an additional $1 billion capital expenditure for 2012 to accelerate 3G data capacity expansion.\n",
            "[00:08:29,750 --> 00:08:42,910]  The group capex budget will be raised to around $11.8 billion, of which $6.7 billion will be for mobile, $2.8 billion for the construction and equipment of the IDC,\n",
            "[00:08:43,910 --> 00:08:53,910]  and $1.4 billion for fixed-line expansions other than IDC, and $0.9 billion for cable TV and other subsidiaries.\n",
            "[00:08:54,910 --> 00:09:03,660]  So let me turn the mic back to Vivian.\n",
            "[00:09:05,010 --> 00:09:11,010]  The slide of award and recognition lists the awards we have recently received.\n",
            "[00:09:12,010 --> 00:09:18,320]  For your reference, please turn to the key message pages.\n",
            "[00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:24,320]  To wrap up our presentation, we would like to summarize the key messages.\n",
            "[00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:32,320]  To meet increased demand for data, we have stepped up our efforts to further build up our network.\n",
            "[00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:35,320]  These efforts will continue prudently.\n",
            "[00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:44,320]  Overall, we reiterate our confidence in achieving our year 2012 targets.\n",
            "[00:09:45,740 --> 00:09:48,740]  Now we would like to open the floor for questions and answers.\n",
            "[00:09:49,900 --> 00:09:52,900]  Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, we will now open for questions.\n",
            "[00:09:52,900 --> 00:09:57,900]  If you would like to register for a question, please press star 1 key on your telephone touchpad. Thank you.\n",
            "[00:10:02,830 --> 00:10:06,830]  Our first question comes from Jaydee Ban of Credit Suisse Hong Kong. Please go ahead.\n",
            "[00:10:07,830 --> 00:10:13,830]  Hi, thank you very much, and thank you for an opportunity to ask the question. Congratulations on the result.\n",
            "[00:10:14,830 --> 00:10:16,830]  I have four questions.\n",
            "[00:10:17,860 --> 00:10:22,860]  The first question is regarding the capex. Now I understand about an increase in the capex near term.\n",
            "[00:10:23,860 --> 00:10:32,860]  Would you be able to share with us what is your view in terms of the capex picture into next year and maybe a couple of years ahead as well?\n",
            "[00:10:33,860 --> 00:10:39,860]  Should we actually expect capex to go back to the level that you spent last year, like 8 to 9% of sales,\n",
            "[00:10:40,860 --> 00:10:45,860]  or should it remain closer to the current level, like 10 to 12% of sales?\n",
            "[00:10:46,860 --> 00:10:52,020]  The second question is regarding the mobile data pricing.\n",
            "[00:10:53,020 --> 00:10:58,020]  I understand that there's still no plan to move away from unlimited in Taiwan.\n",
            "[00:10:59,020 --> 00:11:04,020]  What's your view on that? Is it time that we should try to monetize the data usage more from here?\n",
            "[00:11:05,020 --> 00:11:11,760]  The third question is regarding your recent promotions, including Mobile 250 on data as well.\n",
            "[00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:18,760]  I understand that the pricing is actually quite aggressive, even though it's a longer-term lock-up of 30 months.\n",
            "[00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:26,920]  The reason you introduced this package is because it's time that we need to lower the price in order to grow the smartphone best from here,\n",
            "[00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:28,920]  or it's just a symptom of competition?\n",
            "[00:11:29,950 --> 00:11:34,950]  And the fourth question is, I'm sorry, I understand that you mentioned it already, but I missed it,\n",
            "[00:11:34,950 --> 00:11:41,950]  the subscriber and net additions breakdown of the high-end and medium-end and low-end smartphone subscribers.\n",
            "[00:11:42,950 --> 00:11:49,300]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:11:50,300 --> 00:12:01,300]  Capex picture for the next few years, I would say to strip off the $2.8 billion from this year's capex number of $11.8 billion,\n",
            "[00:12:02,300 --> 00:12:08,300]  then it will be $9 billion, of which $6.7 billion will be from the mobile front.\n",
            "[00:12:08,300 --> 00:12:19,300]  I would say that to me, the increased demand from data usage, we expected some capex to maintain at this level,\n",
            "[00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:28,300]  which is up slightly from our previous year's number, and that shall continue.\n",
            "[00:12:29,300 --> 00:12:40,580]  And as for your second question on the lift-off and limited data rate plan, Cliff will have a clearer picture for you.\n",
            "[00:12:41,580 --> 00:12:54,410]  At the moment, we are still talking with the NCC, and by this moment, there is no final decision made by NCC regarding\n",
            "[00:12:54,410 --> 00:13:01,570]  what should be the approach if we move away from the all-you-can-eat tariff plan.\n",
            "[00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:10,920]  We continue to negotiate with NCC, but I think the all-you-can-eat tariff plan will be here,\n",
            "[00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:15,920]  and will not be away until, I think, at least in the fourth quarter,\n",
            "[00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:25,420]  because up to now, NCC hasn't suggested any proposal yet.\n",
            "[00:13:26,420 --> 00:13:34,540]  As for the third question, I think the tariff is only a promotion.\n",
            "[00:13:35,540 --> 00:13:43,540]  In the second quarter, we see more uptake in the lower-end smartphone model.\n",
            "[00:13:45,220 --> 00:13:54,220]  So the tariff we are trying to use is to try to move more subscribers to use smartphones.\n",
            "[00:13:55,220 --> 00:14:04,220]  And we recognize a lot of lower-end smartphone users may not need all-you-can-eat tariff,\n",
            "[00:14:05,220 --> 00:14:09,220]  but they are not used to use mobile Internet.\n",
            "[00:14:09,220 --> 00:14:17,440]  Therefore, it's a promotion, it's a way to try to attract this user to switch to smartphone\n",
            "[00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:22,440]  and try to educate them to use the mobile Internet.\n",
            "[00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:29,440]  But I don't think that is the intention. It's not really because of the competition.\n",
            "[00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:36,470]  It's just trying to move our install base to smartphone and mobile Internet usage.\n",
            "[00:14:37,470 --> 00:14:42,630]  The current mixture, our high-end, about $9,000 smartphone,\n",
            "[00:14:43,630 --> 00:14:48,630]  take up roughly 55% of our sales, over $9,000.\n",
            "[00:14:49,630 --> 00:14:54,630]  And below $9,000, take up roughly 45% of our sales volume.\n",
            "[00:14:55,630 --> 00:15:00,780]  That's perfect. Just two follow-up questions, if I may.\n",
            "[00:15:01,780 --> 00:15:04,780]  The first question is regarding the unlimited data services.\n",
            "[00:15:04,780 --> 00:15:08,780]  So we need to wait for the NCC to make a decision on this as well?\n",
            "[00:15:09,780 --> 00:15:12,780]  And the operators cannot just go ahead and just do it?\n",
            "[00:15:13,780 --> 00:15:14,780]  No, they cannot.\n",
            "[00:15:15,780 --> 00:15:19,780]  The second follow-up is on the new promotions.\n",
            "[00:15:20,780 --> 00:15:25,780]  Don't you think this would actually cannibalize your medium-end or even some of the higher-end guys as well?\n",
            "[00:15:26,780 --> 00:15:29,780]  I mean, one gig of data is not a small amount of number.\n",
            "[00:15:30,780 --> 00:15:31,780]  It's not a small amount of data.\n",
            "[00:15:31,780 --> 00:15:41,810]  Well, because the promotion rate was end after the subscriber used for six months.\n",
            "[00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:52,130]  And if we don't give them a decent bandwidth, I think it only discourages them from using it.\n",
            "[00:15:53,130 --> 00:15:59,420]  Based on our experience, you are quite right.\n",
            "[00:15:59,420 --> 00:16:06,700]  A smartphone user, if they don't use mobile internet a lot, 1G will be quite okay for them.\n",
            "[00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:15,700]  As I said, this is trying to educate them so that when they use it, if it's always below 1G,\n",
            "[00:16:16,700 --> 00:16:26,700]  then they may subscribe to our term or other term, which maybe 800 or 400, 500 megabytes will be good enough.\n",
            "[00:16:26,700 --> 00:16:33,700]  Because nowadays, even though all-you-can-eat tariff is a very good tariff,\n",
            "[00:16:34,700 --> 00:16:40,700]  but still a lot of people feel that they don't need all-you-can-eat and the price is too high.\n",
            "[00:16:42,890 --> 00:16:47,890]  As I said, it's a way to educate them, to motivate them to use.\n",
            "[00:16:48,890 --> 00:16:54,890]  And we don't want them to feel that if they use a little more, they are going to pay 800.\n",
            "[00:16:54,890 --> 00:17:02,300]  So for them to break in, they have to break in to use the mobile internet.\n",
            "[00:17:03,300 --> 00:17:08,250]  So therefore, I don't think it's going to cannibalize.\n",
            "[00:17:09,250 --> 00:17:14,340]  Because most of these are very low-end smartphone buyers.\n",
            "[00:17:15,340 --> 00:17:23,850]  Okay. So if I use Samsung Galaxy S3, for example, I will not be subscribing to this plan? Are you suggesting that?\n",
            "[00:17:23,850 --> 00:17:30,850]  Yes, because the low tariff means that the subsidy level is very low.\n",
            "[00:17:31,850 --> 00:17:39,520]  If you want to buy a Galaxy S3, you would like to enjoy more subsidy, right?\n",
            "[00:17:41,190 --> 00:17:43,190]  Right. Okay. I'm with you.\n",
            "[00:17:45,180 --> 00:17:51,180]  So after we launch the program, up to now, we don't see any cannibalization at the moment.\n",
            "[00:17:53,180 --> 00:17:55,180]  All right. That is cool. Thank you so much.\n",
            "[00:17:55,180 --> 00:18:01,870]  Thank you. Our next question comes from Neil Anderson of HSBC Hong Kong. Please go ahead.\n",
            "[00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:08,160]  Hi. Thank you. Two questions for me, please. One on CapEx, and this time it's more the near term.\n",
            "[00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:18,160]  What puzzles me slightly about the CapEx increase is that the trends in terms of smartphone adoption have been pretty stable, about one percentage point per month increase.\n",
            "[00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:24,160]  And as far as we're aware, I think the data usage has been quite stable as well.\n",
            "[00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:31,160]  Given that, and given that you've also been building out more backhaul, why the one billion increase now?\n",
            "[00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:35,160]  Is this to get ahead and offer a better service quality than your competitors?\n",
            "[00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:42,160]  Or is it because there's been some change in the usage pattern or the data usage of your subscribers?\n",
            "[00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:44,160]  That's my first question.\n",
            "[00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:51,160]  And secondly, on the enterprise business group, since the margin trends were very positive in the second quarter,\n",
            "[00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:56,160]  could you give any guidance on how you think about longer term margins in this segment?\n",
            "[00:18:57,160 --> 00:18:58,160]  That would be very helpful. Thank you.\n",
            "[00:19:01,110 --> 00:19:11,870]  I think the CapEx increase just reflects that, as you know, the smartphone traffic can increase very fast.\n",
            "[00:19:12,870 --> 00:19:22,420]  Even though it's kind of stable now, but we know the iPhone 5 will be launched in the fourth quarter.\n",
            "[00:19:22,420 --> 00:19:27,450]  The iPad mini will be launched in the fourth quarter.\n",
            "[00:19:30,660 --> 00:19:38,940]  And therefore, currently our network planning is kind of just a little ahead.\n",
            "[00:19:39,940 --> 00:19:46,940]  Because in the past, we pretty much have a network planning which is build enough capacity for certain months.\n",
            "[00:19:47,940 --> 00:19:56,940]  But right now, because of the uncertainty, even though currently we think the current CapEx can hold on to the end of this year,\n",
            "[00:19:57,940 --> 00:20:12,940]  but we feel that it's better to prepare earlier so that we don't fall into the situation that we will be caught off guard like AT&T, like CHT.\n",
            "[00:20:13,940 --> 00:20:19,940]  So this is a precaution. So we ask for extra CapEx so we build certain buffer.\n",
            "[00:20:21,550 --> 00:20:26,550]  That's for the first question. And I think the EBG margin will continue to improve.\n",
            "[00:20:27,550 --> 00:20:31,550]  But I wouldn't say significantly, but we are trying to control the expense.\n",
            "[00:20:32,550 --> 00:20:39,550]  We are trying to control the margin we sell. So I think the trend will continue.\n",
            "[00:20:42,180 --> 00:20:45,010]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:20:45,010 --> 00:20:49,010]  Thank you. Our next question comes from Danny Chu of Nomura Hong Kong. Please go ahead.\n",
            "[00:20:51,070 --> 00:20:55,070]  Hi. Thank you for the presentation. Just three quick questions.\n",
            "[00:20:56,070 --> 00:21:03,070]  First is, again, back to the CapEx question. I understand the CapEx will be depreciated over a number of years.\n",
            "[00:21:04,070 --> 00:21:12,070]  Since in your presentation you mentioned that you are still confident to achieve your 2012 earnings guidance,\n",
            "[00:21:12,070 --> 00:21:18,070]  should we expect due to this 1 billion additional CapEx expenditure,\n",
            "[00:21:19,070 --> 00:21:30,070]  internally you are guiding for higher revenue, higher EBITDA in order to meet the 2012 net profit guidance that were being given out earlier this year?\n",
            "[00:21:31,070 --> 00:21:32,070]  That's my first question.\n",
            "[00:21:33,070 --> 00:21:42,070]  Second question is, in your presentation you also mentioned that the results of MOMO is slightly disappointed than your own expectation.\n",
            "[00:21:43,070 --> 00:21:50,070]  Has that been incorporated into the 2012 earnings guidance that we are being given?\n",
            "[00:21:51,070 --> 00:21:57,070]  Or like in your internal guidance, at that time when you do the budget,\n",
            "[00:21:57,070 --> 00:22:02,070]  you didn't expect MOMO will be disappointed as it is right now?\n",
            "[00:22:03,070 --> 00:22:14,070]  And finally, on the unlimited data pricing plan, assuming that NCC will not make any ruling on this even next year,\n",
            "[00:22:15,070 --> 00:22:21,070]  does it mean that we will expect to see the CapEx for the mobile business to go higher and higher\n",
            "[00:22:22,070 --> 00:22:29,070]  simply because consumers continue to heavily use this unlimited data pricing plan? Thank you.\n",
            "[00:22:30,070 --> 00:22:42,900]  I think as we said, even though with the increase of the CapEx,\n",
            "[00:22:44,120 --> 00:22:49,120]  the management team is fully committed and we don't see any reason that we cannot achieve.\n",
            "[00:22:50,120 --> 00:22:55,940]  Even the MOMO performance is not satisfactory at the moment,\n",
            "[00:22:55,940 --> 00:23:00,980]  but we do believe that we will achieve the financial guidelines.\n",
            "[00:23:01,980 --> 00:23:06,980]  These have been considered into our financial guidelines.\n",
            "[00:23:07,980 --> 00:23:13,070]  And we also consider the iPhone 5 impact to the expenses.\n",
            "[00:23:14,070 --> 00:23:19,070]  So I want to reiterate that we will achieve our financial guidelines.\n",
            "[00:23:20,070 --> 00:23:28,130]  And as for the reason why the all-you-can-eat tariff hasn't been decided yet,\n",
            "[00:23:29,130 --> 00:23:41,290]  because at the moment, four of the seven members of the NCC commission will be replaced by the end of July.\n",
            "[00:23:42,380 --> 00:23:46,380]  So the new commissioner will join on August 1st.\n",
            "[00:23:46,380 --> 00:23:52,380]  That's why a lot of things which are under discussion in NCC for the past two months\n",
            "[00:23:53,380 --> 00:24:00,380]  kind of didn't go anywhere because people are waiting for the new members of the NCC.\n",
            "[00:24:01,380 --> 00:24:08,380]  But once they join, I think these issues will be raised again and we will have more discussion.\n",
            "[00:24:09,380 --> 00:24:15,380]  And that's why I mentioned that maybe in the fourth quarter we can see certain results from it.\n",
            "[00:24:16,380 --> 00:24:19,380]  And we will have guidance from the NCC regarding this issue.\n",
            "[00:24:22,210 --> 00:24:25,100]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:24:26,100 --> 00:24:29,100]  Thank you. Our next question comes from Joseph Queen of Macquarie, Taiwan. Please go ahead.\n",
            "[00:24:30,100 --> 00:24:33,100]  Hi, Chris. Thanks very much for the opportunity to ask some questions.\n",
            "[00:24:34,100 --> 00:24:35,100]  And congrats again on the results.\n",
            "[00:24:36,100 --> 00:24:37,100]  Three questions for myself.\n",
            "[00:24:38,100 --> 00:24:45,100]  Firstly, the NCC yesterday approved an amendment to the Telecommunications Act that will affect Tsiong Hwa's fixed line.\n",
            "[00:24:45,100 --> 00:24:50,100]  I'm just interested at this stage, if obviously it's passed by the Executive Yuan,\n",
            "[00:24:51,100 --> 00:24:55,100]  what parts of the business would Taomobile be most interested in going into?\n",
            "[00:24:56,100 --> 00:25:03,100]  I.e., would you increase your penetration into broadband using other than the cable broadband you're using right now?\n",
            "[00:25:04,100 --> 00:25:05,100]  I'd just be interested on that side of things.\n",
            "[00:25:06,100 --> 00:25:08,100]  Secondly, on the blended smartphone ARPU,\n",
            "[00:25:08,100 --> 00:25:14,100]  I do see that there has been a slight drop from the first quarter number that you gave in April.\n",
            "[00:25:15,100 --> 00:25:21,100]  Just overall, I understand that there will be an increased mix of low-end users that will be planning that down.\n",
            "[00:25:22,100 --> 00:25:27,100]  But can you give us an overall idea of your smartphone mix right now and the size of your smartphone user base?\n",
            "[00:25:28,100 --> 00:25:34,100]  And then thirdly, on the last, so the new promotions you have, the one gigabyte and the prepaid plans,\n",
            "[00:25:34,100 --> 00:25:38,100]  they all look very good promotions and the advertisements here look very good on them.\n",
            "[00:25:39,100 --> 00:25:44,100]  Particularly the prepaid plans seem to be very focused on the student market as well.\n",
            "[00:25:45,100 --> 00:25:51,100]  And just on that market segment, can you give us a sense of your market, how you see yourself?\n",
            "[00:25:52,100 --> 00:25:56,100]  Are you particularly strong at this stage in the student market and you're defending that market?\n",
            "[00:25:57,100 --> 00:25:59,100]  Or do you see this as a new growth market for you? Thanks.\n",
            "[00:26:00,100 --> 00:26:16,510]  Well, as for the amendment of the Telecom Act, I think this will, if that gets, it's going to help our broadband business,\n",
            "[00:26:17,670 --> 00:26:18,670]  especially the home business users.\n",
            "[00:26:20,090 --> 00:26:22,090]  Because currently, as you know, we sell.\n",
            "[00:26:25,300 --> 00:26:28,220]  There are a few situations that you cannot get access.\n",
            "[00:26:29,220 --> 00:26:32,110]  So the customer will have two choices.\n",
            "[00:26:33,110 --> 00:26:38,110]  Either they can use cable modem as a circuit or they can use ADSL or fiber as a circuit.\n",
            "[00:26:43,820 --> 00:26:48,820]  And the APU, Sherry, would you want to comment on the APU?\n",
            "[00:26:49,820 --> 00:27:01,460]  Our second course of learning APU is on service and postpaid service.\n",
            "[00:27:02,690 --> 00:27:23,390]  Postpaid APU are low in the prepaid market.\n",
            "[00:27:24,390 --> 00:27:28,000]  But we certainly see that because of the mobile internet.\n",
            "[00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:31,000]  Traditionally, prepaid users are more voice only.\n",
            "[00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:37,350]  And so we don't have burden in this particular market.\n",
            "[00:27:38,350 --> 00:27:49,220]  But it never happened in the prepaid market.\n",
            "[00:27:56,460 --> 00:27:57,460]  That's very helpful.\n",
            "[00:28:00,540 --> 00:28:02,540]  And can I just follow up on the data side of things?\n",
            "[00:28:03,540 --> 00:28:11,540]  Far Eastone had commented yesterday that they have seen an increase in data usage due to particularly mentioning video viewership.\n",
            "[00:28:12,540 --> 00:28:19,540]  And they meant to comment that their average user data has increased from about one gigabyte to between 1.2, 1.5.\n",
            "[00:28:19,540 --> 00:28:27,540]  I'm just wondering, have you seen similar trends and could that potentially be some of the reasons why you're also increasing your data capex as well?\n",
            "[00:28:28,540 --> 00:28:29,540]  Thanks.\n",
            "[00:28:32,940 --> 00:28:44,050]  The increase has more to do with the number of the smartphone users.\n",
            "[00:28:45,050 --> 00:28:47,270]  It has less to do with the usage.\n",
            "[00:28:48,270 --> 00:28:51,270]  It's purely because we see more and more smartphone users.\n",
            "[00:28:52,270 --> 00:28:58,330]  And when you build the base station, it has to go through a very long and tedious process.\n",
            "[00:28:58,330 --> 00:29:06,330]  And when you want to build base stations, you need to submit a plan to NCC for approval.\n",
            "[00:29:07,330 --> 00:29:17,330]  It's not like if you have a traffic increase and you want to build a base station, you really need six to nine months in preparation.\n",
            "[00:29:18,330 --> 00:29:27,330]  And so, as I said, the data increase reflects the number of the subscribers we expect.\n",
            "[00:29:28,330 --> 00:29:40,780]  And also, we want to build a certain capacity so that we can better accommodate if there's a surge of traffic or whatsoever in the future.\n",
            "[00:29:42,700 --> 00:29:59,100]  And coming back to your question on our growth in data usage, on a quarter to quarter basis, our data usage actually is about half a gig.\n",
            "[00:30:00,100 --> 00:30:06,070]  So your average smartphone usage is about half a gigabyte?\n",
            "[00:30:07,070 --> 00:30:08,070]  No, no, no, increase.\n",
            "[00:30:09,070 --> 00:30:10,070]  Oh, increase about half a gigabyte?\n",
            "[00:30:11,070 --> 00:30:12,070]  Yeah, to 1.5.\n",
            "[00:30:13,070 --> 00:30:16,070]  To 1.5. Okay, okay. All right, that's very helpful. Thanks very much.\n",
            "[00:30:18,380 --> 00:30:23,380]  Thank you. Our next question comes from Stephen Liu of Standard China Bank in Hong Kong. Please go ahead.\n",
            "[00:30:24,380 --> 00:30:32,500]  Hi, Stephen. Please go ahead. Thank you.\n",
            "[00:30:38,650 --> 00:30:44,650]  Okay, Stephen has canceled the question. Our next question comes from Lucy Liu of JP Morgan Hong Kong. Please go ahead.\n",
            "[00:30:45,650 --> 00:30:51,650]  Hi, thank you very much. I just have a few questions. One is on your EBITDA margin.\n",
            "[00:30:51,650 --> 00:30:57,650]  So we have seen quite very encouraging trend in second quarter in terms of margin of CBG and EBG business.\n",
            "[00:30:58,650 --> 00:31:05,650]  So it seems like on the monthly run rate, so you are ahead of your full year guidance in terms of EBITDA margin trend.\n",
            "[00:31:06,650 --> 00:31:09,650]  So I think if I'm not wrong, your guidance previously was 28%.\n",
            "[00:31:10,650 --> 00:31:16,650]  So just wondering, I understand that you probably include some of the iPhone 5 impact in the rest of the year.\n",
            "[00:31:16,650 --> 00:31:24,650]  But do you think what's the trend if excluding iPhone 5 for your business in terms of margin trend in the rest of the year?\n",
            "[00:31:25,650 --> 00:31:34,650]  And what do you see the operating leverage can be stronger enough to offset the impact of more handset sales than iPhone 5 impact?\n",
            "[00:31:35,650 --> 00:31:36,650]  This is question number one.\n",
            "[00:31:37,650 --> 00:31:43,650]  Number two, can I have an idea about your smartphone mix in terms of a high end and a low end?\n",
            "[00:31:43,650 --> 00:31:52,650]  And also in terms of future pipeline in the rest of the year, what part of the segment you see the strongest growth?\n",
            "[00:31:53,650 --> 00:32:02,650]  And also in terms of MOMO, so it seems like the MOMO margin is actually trending even lower and lower.\n",
            "[00:32:03,650 --> 00:32:07,650]  Now I think it's already to 4% in certain months.\n",
            "[00:32:08,650 --> 00:32:11,650]  So what do you think will be the floor for the MOMO EBITDA margin?\n",
            "[00:32:11,650 --> 00:32:16,650]  And do you think the environment will change the business in the second half of the year?\n",
            "[00:32:17,650 --> 00:32:19,650]  And the last question is on competition.\n",
            "[00:32:20,650 --> 00:32:27,650]  So we realize that some of the smartphone competition is heating up by your competitors.\n",
            "[00:32:28,650 --> 00:32:32,650]  And do you see any impact on your business in the month of July as a result of that?\n",
            "[00:32:33,650 --> 00:32:37,650]  And also what's our general measures to cope with such kind of competition?\n",
            "[00:32:38,650 --> 00:32:39,650]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:32:40,650 --> 00:33:42,470]  Basically, they did not meet our OTV.\n",
            "[00:34:42,830 --> 00:34:46,830]  Yes, and also, can I follow up one question regarding EBITDA margin?\n",
            "[00:34:47,830 --> 00:34:50,830]  So first half, CBG and EBG margin better than expectation.\n",
            "[00:34:51,830 --> 00:34:56,830]  Do you see upside risk to your 28% guidance for the full year for the whole group?\n",
            "[00:34:57,860 --> 00:34:58,860]  You mean 28%?\n",
            "[00:34:59,860 --> 00:35:00,860]  28%, sorry, yeah, 28%.\n",
            "[00:35:01,860 --> 00:35:02,860]  You mean risk or?\n",
            "[00:35:02,860 --> 00:35:07,860]  Upside risk, I mean, I think generally the margin trend due to the operating leverage,\n",
            "[00:35:08,860 --> 00:35:13,860]  do you expect that the margin trend should go up throughout most of your business?\n",
            "[00:35:14,860 --> 00:35:28,450]  Basically, we could outperform EBITDA margin.\n",
            "[00:35:29,450 --> 00:35:30,450]  Okay, thank you.\n",
            "[00:35:31,450 --> 00:35:33,450]  And also, sorry, another follow-up.\n",
            "[00:35:33,450 --> 00:35:38,450]  So in terms of, oh, so basically in terms of broadband,\n",
            "[00:35:39,450 --> 00:35:43,450]  so we are seeing, you know, a lot of the regulatory pressures currently on Chonghua's broadband,\n",
            "[00:35:44,450 --> 00:35:46,450]  ADSL, and the fiber business.\n",
            "[00:35:47,450 --> 00:35:55,450]  So do you feel that the pricing pressure or whether the regulatory pressure will apply to your cable broadband in future\n",
            "[00:35:56,450 --> 00:35:59,450]  given that Taiwan generally wants to boost the broadband penetration?\n",
            "[00:35:59,450 --> 00:36:12,890]  Cable broadband is under the jurisdiction of the local, which is different from NCC.\n",
            "[00:36:13,890 --> 00:36:25,420]  So meaning that, you know, they are not going to be under the pressure in terms of boosting the penetration?\n",
            "[00:36:26,420 --> 00:36:28,540]  Let me put it this way.\n",
            "[00:36:28,540 --> 00:36:29,540]  So let me put it this way.\n",
            "[00:36:30,540 --> 00:36:42,260]  Even though Zhonghua Telecom, but in general, the cable broadband is sell at 15% to 20% compared with CHD.\n",
            "[00:36:43,260 --> 00:36:47,260]  Of course, if CHD lower the price, it's going to put pressure on the cable broadband.\n",
            "[00:36:48,260 --> 00:36:55,260]  But please remember that this also means that people will switch to higher speed.\n",
            "[00:36:56,260 --> 00:37:00,260]  Therefore, in the past, CHD has lowered several times.\n",
            "[00:37:00,260 --> 00:37:04,260]  It only increased the usage and people moved to higher speed.\n",
            "[00:37:05,260 --> 00:37:08,260]  So it means that our output will be higher.\n",
            "[00:37:09,260 --> 00:37:21,770]  Therefore, so with this compensation, we don't see the impact will be negatively impacted by the CHD pricing pressure.\n",
            "[00:37:22,770 --> 00:37:25,530]  Sure. Thank you very much.\n",
            "[00:37:26,530 --> 00:37:31,710]  Thank you. Our next question comes from Stephen Liu of the China in Hong Kong. Please go ahead.\n",
            "[00:37:31,710 --> 00:37:36,810]  Thank you. I have two questions. It's also about Momo and the cable business.\n",
            "[00:37:37,810 --> 00:37:42,810]  Regarding Momo, I think in the past few quarters, it's deteriorating margin.\n",
            "[00:37:43,810 --> 00:37:48,810]  And maybe I think I'm afraid you may be in a loss in the last month on the Momo business.\n",
            "[00:37:49,810 --> 00:37:52,810]  Are you taking some measures to reverse the trend?\n",
            "[00:37:53,810 --> 00:37:58,810]  Or are you really concerned about the outlook for the coming few years in the Momo business?\n",
            "[00:37:58,810 --> 00:38:01,810]  Because it's really a big segment of your total revenue.\n",
            "[00:38:02,810 --> 00:38:08,810]  And second question regarding the cables, I think Chunhua is aggressively upgrading the broadband to fiber.\n",
            "[00:38:09,810 --> 00:38:18,810]  I think maybe this technology is difficult for you to upgrade the cable broadband to compete with the fiber to the home.\n",
            "[00:38:19,810 --> 00:38:27,810]  So would you be aggressively competing or investing in a cable or take some defensive measure in a cable business?\n",
            "[00:38:28,810 --> 00:38:34,770]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:38:35,770 --> 00:38:50,700]  Regarding the cable broadband, I remember going to your household, the cable user, cable operators have coaxial cable.\n",
            "[00:38:51,990 --> 00:38:58,100]  Coaxial cable can carry 100 megabits per second.\n",
            "[00:38:59,100 --> 00:39:04,390]  While in the meantime, even Chunhua has a fiber to the household.\n",
            "[00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:10,000]  It's very, very difficult to really carry a fiber to the household.\n",
            "[00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:14,000]  They can bring a fiber to the curb.\n",
            "[00:39:15,290 --> 00:39:28,800]  But inside the wiring, new building, in most of the traditional building, you still have twisted pair.\n",
            "[00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:37,800]  And therefore, it's very hard to Chunhua Telecom to bring the speed up to a level.\n",
            "[00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:59,600]  And besides, therefore, even though Chunhua to all the household can increase,\n",
            "[00:40:00,600 --> 00:40:13,180]  therefore, we don't see CHT raising the speed bar present a problem to us\n",
            "[00:40:14,180 --> 00:40:18,180]  because we also increase handling in the cable infrastructure.\n",
            "[00:40:21,260 --> 00:40:23,260]  As for Momo, let Rosie.\n",
            "[00:40:24,260 --> 00:40:25,260]  Yeah.\n",
            "[00:40:26,260 --> 00:40:36,260]  Momo's situation, well, we are quite concerned over Momo's less than satisfactory performance in the second quarter.\n",
            "[00:40:37,260 --> 00:40:49,300]  As I mentioned earlier, it's an expected performance of their TV home shopping business as well as their catalog business.\n",
            "[00:40:49,300 --> 00:41:00,500]  So we have reviewed their situations and cut their costs and expenses.\n",
            "[00:41:01,500 --> 00:41:12,760]  Having said that, we have prepared that they may not be able to achieve their annual.\n",
            "[00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:25,420]  We think their Chinese operation is still losing money and expectation.\n",
            "[00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:43,700]  But they have sent a brand new team over to review the situation business there.\n",
            "[00:42:02,840 --> 00:42:03,840]  Okay. Thank you.\n",
            "[00:42:04,840 --> 00:42:06,840]  Maybe a follow-up on the cable business.\n",
            "[00:42:07,840 --> 00:42:12,840]  What's the maximum speed can you achieve to upgrade the cable broadband?\n",
            "[00:42:13,840 --> 00:42:15,840]  It can be over 100 megs?\n",
            "[00:42:17,260 --> 00:42:22,080]  It can be even 300.\n",
            "[00:42:23,080 --> 00:42:25,080]  It's no problem for the cable operators.\n",
            "[00:42:26,080 --> 00:42:43,010]  If you look at in the United States or Taiwan, the speed gain against, if you introduce the DOS 3 or anything.\n",
            "[00:42:44,010 --> 00:42:51,900]  So, as I said, the cable installation in the household provides a better benefit than the twisted pair.\n",
            "[00:42:52,900 --> 00:42:58,900]  And it's very, very difficult to replace all the twisted pairs with fiber in all the households.\n",
            "[00:43:01,090 --> 00:43:02,090]  Okay. Thank you. Thank you very much.\n",
            "[00:43:03,090 --> 00:43:04,380]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:43:04,380 --> 00:43:09,380]  Ladies and gentlemen, if you'd like to register for a question, please press star 1 key on your telephone touchpad.\n",
            "[00:43:10,380 --> 00:43:12,820]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:43:13,820 --> 00:43:15,820]  Our next question comes from Joseph Green of Macquarie, Taiwan. Please go ahead.\n",
            "[00:43:16,820 --> 00:43:20,820]  Hi, Cliff. Can I just ask one question in relation to the cable business as well?\n",
            "[00:43:21,820 --> 00:43:30,820]  On the digital TV side, we've seen some of your cable peers becoming rather aggressive in their digital set-top boxes\n",
            "[00:43:31,820 --> 00:43:34,820]  and also offering recording ability to the users as well.\n",
            "[00:43:35,820 --> 00:43:39,820]  And trying to joint market this with some of the Olympic events that's coming up.\n",
            "[00:43:40,820 --> 00:43:44,820]  I was just wondering, what's your forecast at this moment?\n",
            "[00:43:45,820 --> 00:43:50,820]  I remember you did comment on digital subscriber forecast before, but I was just wondering, have you potentially increased those?\n",
            "[00:43:51,820 --> 00:43:56,820]  Are you looking to be more rapid in the adoption of digital TV among your user base? Thanks.\n",
            "[00:43:56,820 --> 00:44:10,940]  Well, yes. I think all those things, for instance, digital recorder, all those kind of things, we are going to introduce in our territory.\n",
            "[00:44:11,980 --> 00:44:14,980]  So, we are aggressively pursuing that approach.\n",
            "[00:44:15,980 --> 00:44:27,980]  Plus, we are actively sourcing a better, cheaper set-top box to further penetrate the digital TV market.\n",
            "[00:44:28,980 --> 00:44:39,010]  And I think some of this will get implemented before the first half of the next year.\n",
            "[00:44:39,010 --> 00:44:57,470]  As you know, we have a commitment and the government currently has a mandate at the cable TV operator to provide digital TV 100% by the end of 2014.\n",
            "[00:44:58,470 --> 00:45:04,860]  So, we are very aggressively pursuing to increase our penetration.\n",
            "[00:45:07,870 --> 00:45:08,870]  That's very helpful. Thank you.\n",
            "[00:45:08,870 --> 00:45:14,420]  Thank you. Our next question comes from Joyce Cho of Barclays Hong Kong. Please go ahead.\n",
            "[00:45:15,420 --> 00:45:17,420]  Hi. Thank you for the chance to ask questions.\n",
            "[00:45:18,420 --> 00:45:31,420]  First, I just want to get an idea on the output difference between the low-end to mid-end smartphone users versus the high-end smartphone users such as iPhone and Samsung Galaxy S3.\n",
            "[00:45:32,420 --> 00:45:51,420]  And also, on the telecom act, I just want to get an idea because I saw some news comment that NCC would like to lower Chonghua Telecom's fixed line market share to 50% to 70% from current over 90%.\n",
            "[00:45:52,420 --> 00:46:06,420]  How much do you think cable broadband players could get from the market share? And what do you think of the competitive environment change from this?\n",
            "[00:46:07,420 --> 00:46:20,420]  And my third question is also regarding on MOMO. So, if you look at the MOMO margin, I think in June, the margin declined to 2.3%.\n",
            "[00:46:21,420 --> 00:46:32,420]  So, just wondering, do you think the June number should be the bottom for the MOMO business or do you think there is chance that things can be worse than June number?\n",
            "[00:46:33,420 --> 00:46:34,420]  Thank you very much.\n",
            "[00:46:34,420 --> 00:46:56,800]  The output difference is about 700MT between the high-end and the mid-end smartphones.\n",
            "[00:46:58,470 --> 00:47:00,470]  I will leave the telecom act question to you.\n",
            "[00:47:01,820 --> 00:47:28,260]  And on the MOMO margin, I think it is probably the bottom already. As told by seasonal changes in the third quarter and fourth quarter, Cliff will elaborate on that.\n",
            "[00:47:28,260 --> 00:47:38,640]  I think if you look at the United States, the cable operators take up more than 40% of the broadband market.\n",
            "[00:47:39,640 --> 00:47:49,640]  And I think in Taiwan, we can assume reasonably that the cable operators can take up more than 40%.\n",
            "[00:47:51,570 --> 00:48:01,590]  Plus, the United States, the cable operators are cable operators. In Taiwan, we own the cable operators.\n",
            "[00:48:02,590 --> 00:48:14,460]  So, with our telecom expertise, we can help our home business group to think over 40% decline.\n",
            "[00:48:19,590 --> 00:48:20,590]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:48:22,780 --> 00:48:25,780]  Thank you. Next question comes from Lucy Liu of JP Morgan Hong Kong. Please go ahead.\n",
            "[00:48:26,780 --> 00:48:29,780]  Hi, thank you. I have a follow-up question on this telecom act.\n",
            "[00:48:30,780 --> 00:48:49,780]  So, according to the news, it seems like the NCC actually urged Chunhua to release some of its local loop or lost knowledge linkage so that it can actually release some of the market share to the other operators in terms of fixed line and broadband.\n",
            "[00:48:50,780 --> 00:48:57,780]  So, just wondering what's your strategy if Chunhua actually agrees on this one?\n",
            "[00:48:58,780 --> 00:49:03,780]  And what's the approach you're going to do for this local loop or lost knowledge?\n",
            "[00:49:04,780 --> 00:49:10,780]  Are you going to build most of the network by yourself, increasing capex on that or whatever the other ways?\n",
            "[00:49:11,780 --> 00:49:19,780]  So, this is question number one. Number two is also my previous question on the mobile smartphone competition.\n",
            "[00:49:20,780 --> 00:49:28,780]  So, are you seeing any heating up competition in the latest months? If so, what's the impact on your business and the monthly operation trend so far? Thank you.\n",
            "[00:49:29,780 --> 00:49:57,320]  If the Zoom has not released a lot, it's going to benefit players who are in the territory.\n",
            "[00:49:59,440 --> 00:50:02,440]  It doesn't necessarily benefit the fixed line operators.\n",
            "[00:50:04,050 --> 00:50:13,870]  The fixed line operators traditionally have kind of given up the market because they have tried without success more.\n",
            "[00:50:27,900 --> 00:50:56,460]  And because maybe CHT is listening in the conference too. It's just like it used to be.\n",
            "[00:50:57,460 --> 00:51:13,260]  Okay, thank you. So, just to make sure, to clarify, so you will use your cable network as the lost local loop and focus on the cable broadband business with that existing network infrastructure. Is that correct?\n",
            "[00:51:14,260 --> 00:51:15,260]  Yes.\n",
            "[00:51:16,260 --> 00:51:18,510]  Okay, thank you.\n",

            "[00:51:30,500 --> 00:51:33,500]  Excuse me, there seems to be no further questions at this point in time. Thank you.\n",
            "[00:51:34,500 --> 00:51:36,300]  Okay.\n",
            "[00:51:36,300 --> 00:51:41,580]  Sorry, ma'am, we have a follow-up question. Okay, that comes from Joseph Quinn of Macquarie. Please go ahead.\n",
            "[00:51:42,680 --> 00:51:43,680]  Apologies, I couldn't resist.\n",
            "[00:51:44,680 --> 00:51:57,680]  In terms of your applications that you're seeing being used among your smartphone subscriber base right now, there has been comments from LINE that they have seen Taiwan has been a very, very strong market for them.\n",
            "[00:51:58,680 --> 00:52:09,680]  I was just wondering, have Taiwan Mobile looked at any opportunity to work with one of these application providers rather than just let them freeload on your networks?\n",
            "[00:52:10,680 --> 00:52:27,830]  This is a very good question. Taiwan Mobile has its own strategy to defend that particular market, and I assure you, you will see some of our counterattack in a few months.\n",
            "[00:52:30,530 --> 00:52:31,530]  Look forward to that. Thank you.\n",
            "[00:52:38,450 --> 00:52:42,450]  Thank you once again, ladies and gentlemen. If you have further questions, please press star 1 key now. Thank you.\n",
            "[00:52:43,450 --> 00:52:53,260]  Excuse me, we have no further questions at this point in time. Thank you.\n",
            "[00:52:53,260 --> 00:53:00,740]  Okay, if you don't have any other questions, thank you very much for participating in our conference call. Thank you.\n",
            "[00:53:01,740 --> 00:53:02,780]  Thank you.\n",

            "[00:03:39,350 --> 00:03:47,350]  Taiwan Mobile's consolidated EBITDA was up by 4% YOY on the back of healthy service revenue growth,\n",

            "[00:04:17,350 --> 00:04:28,350]  In addition, less non-operating expenses in year 2012 due to the impairment losses of the Taiwan high-speed rail in year 2011\n",
            "[00:04:29,350 --> 00:04:34,350]  also contributed to a 9% YOY rise in net income.\n",

            "[00:04:57,350 --> 00:05:03,350]  Although the launch of iPhone 5 weighed on CBG's EBITDA from a quarter ago,\n",
            "[00:05:04,350 --> 00:05:08,350]  EBITDA showed a YOY rise due to stronger revenue increase\n",
            "[00:05:08,350 --> 00:05:13,350]  and our measures taken to contain subscriber acquisition cost.\n",
            "[00:05:14,350 --> 00:05:24,350]  The fourth quarter year 2012 EBG's EBITDA QOQ growth was largely a result from expense discipline.\n",
            "[00:05:25,350 --> 00:05:29,350]  In addition, its rising mobile service revenue from our enterprise customers\n",
            "[00:05:30,350 --> 00:05:34,350]  also contributed to a YOY EBITDA increase.\n",

            "[00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:28,520]  non-operating expense increase will be mainly from larger asset write-off losses planned for this year,\n",
            "[00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:34,520]  and more interest expense resulted from higher gearing prepared for 4G.\n",

            "[00:13:55,180 --> 00:13:59,180]  has ruled to confine its direct store-related operations and business\n",
            "[00:14:00,180 --> 00:14:09,180]  by setting up a 100% owned subsidiary with a ceiling of $1 billion NT.\n",
            "[00:14:10,180 --> 00:14:14,180]  The resolution is pending for the shareholders' meeting's approval.\n",
            "[00:14:15,180 --> 00:14:18,180]  The second one would be the accounting policy change.\n",
            "[00:14:19,180 --> 00:14:31,180]  Just as the explanation of Rosie made, to comply with the forthcoming implementation of IFIS,\n",
            "[00:14:32,180 --> 00:14:37,180]  Taiwan Mobile's board approved the change in accounting policy regarding bundle sales\n",

            "[00:15:55,180 --> 00:15:58,180]  Now we open the floor for questions and answers.\n",
            "[00:15:59,180 --> 00:16:00,180]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:16:01,180 --> 00:16:03,180]  Ladies and gentlemen, we will now open for questions.\n",
            "[00:16:03,180 --> 00:16:07,180]  If you would like to register for a question, please press star 1 key now. Thank you.\n",
            "[00:16:08,180 --> 00:16:16,240]  Our first question comes from Chad Ban of Credit Suisse Hong Kong. Please go ahead.\n",
            "[00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:22,240]  Hi, good afternoon and thank you for the opportunity to ask a question.\n",
            "[00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:29,240]  I have firstly a few questions related to the restructuring of your distribution channels by setting up a new company.\n",
            "[00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:40,240]  If you do not mind, can you please elaborate how that actually is going to change the way your distribution channel works?\n",
            "[00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:45,240]  How it's going to actually improve the customer's experience? Thank you.\n",
            "[00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:56,420]  As you know, when the market becomes very, very competitive, the distribution becomes more and more important.\n",
            "[00:16:56,420 --> 00:17:04,420]  Due to that, in the past several years, Taiwan Mobile has expanded strongly in the retail side.\n",
            "[00:17:05,420 --> 00:17:14,420]  We have set up shops every year, so the number of employees in our retail operations becomes very significant.\n",
            "[00:17:15,420 --> 00:17:26,420]  The current personnel structure and human resources policy for operators is not very suitable for retail business,\n",
            "[00:17:27,420 --> 00:17:37,420]  because retail business is mainly very operational and you need very high HR, human resources.\n",
            "[00:17:38,420 --> 00:17:48,420]  In the meantime, the customer comes to the shop not only for service, but they also have devices issues or maintenance issues.\n",
            "[00:17:49,420 --> 00:17:57,420]  In order to build up a facility to satisfy these customers, we think it's necessary to spin up the operations\n",
            "[00:17:57,420 --> 00:18:08,420]  so that we can build an organization to cater not only to the needs of the customers in the mobile service side,\n",
            "[00:18:09,420 --> 00:18:14,420]  but also their needs for service in the hardware and other related products.\n",
            "[00:18:15,420 --> 00:18:19,420]  This is our key reason for spinning up the operations.\n",
            "[00:18:21,290 --> 00:18:28,290]  Thank you. For this spin-off of operations, is there any cost related to it that you might need to book one time in this year?\n",
            "[00:18:29,290 --> 00:18:34,290]  Or it's not really just a change in the way operations work and no cost or no revenue related?\n",
            "[00:18:35,290 --> 00:18:44,290]  There won't be any cost issue. It's just a change to a different way to operate,\n",
            "[00:18:44,290 --> 00:18:52,380]  so that the retail operations can have more flexibility and can pursue certain new opportunities.\n",
            "[00:18:53,380 --> 00:18:57,990]  Okay, thank you. I just have three other questions in other areas.\n",
            "[00:18:58,990 --> 00:19:05,990]  Number one, on the regulatory impact from the change in interconnection, how much you actually built the impact in?\n",
            "[00:19:06,990 --> 00:19:08,990]  Is it neutral on you or is it negative on you?\n",
            "[00:19:09,990 --> 00:19:14,990]  The second question is regarding the assumption for MOMO within your FY13 guidance.\n",
            "[00:19:15,990 --> 00:19:18,990]  Are you expecting any significant turnaround for MOMO in that?\n",
            "[00:19:19,990 --> 00:19:25,990]  If MOMO actually executed better, would it result in any upside risk or is there downside risk around that figure?\n",
            "[00:19:26,990 --> 00:19:29,990]  And the third question is just related to the dividend.\n",
            "[00:19:30,990 --> 00:19:38,990]  So I guess for the dividend that you would be considering based on FY12 earnings,\n",
            "[00:19:39,990 --> 00:19:43,990]  that I guess would still be based on the earnings that's declared under our accounting policy.\n",
            "[00:19:44,990 --> 00:19:51,990]  So it's possibly like 90% regular dividend on that earnings or is it earnings under new accounting? Thank you.\n",
            "[00:19:55,460 --> 00:20:16,420]  We have already built in our impact from the regulatory intervention.\n",
            "[00:20:17,420 --> 00:20:27,420]  And on the interconnection side, actually if you look at the EBITDA or net income, the impact would be roughly 0.4 billion.\n",
            "[00:20:28,420 --> 00:20:48,800]  And MOMO is still pushing very aggressively for its growth on the Internet business.\n",
            "[00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:54,800]  But as you know, it's a retail or low margin business.\n",
            "[00:20:55,800 --> 00:21:04,800]  It does factor in some growth in profits for this year, which has been included in our forecast.\n",
            "[00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:16,800]  And on the dividend issue, we will only discuss the dividend policy in the board meeting scheduled for April.\n",
            "[00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:20,800]  So we don't have any answer for you currently.\n",
            "[00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:24,690]  Okay. Thank you.\n",
            "[00:21:25,690 --> 00:21:31,260]  Thank you. Our next question comes from Tendo of GIC Singapore. Please go ahead. Thank you.\n",
            "[00:21:32,260 --> 00:21:38,260]  Hi. Thanks very much for the conference call. I have just a couple of questions as well.\n",
            "[00:21:39,260 --> 00:21:44,260]  On the CapEx side, you are increasing it for 2013.\n",
            "[00:21:45,260 --> 00:21:58,260]  I am just wondering going forward after 2013 whether this step up in CapEx to just under 13 billion, whether that will be sustained going forward as well in your opinion.\n",
            "[00:21:59,260 --> 00:22:02,260]  The second question is just on the accounting policy change.\n",
            "[00:22:02,260 --> 00:22:06,260]  What is the idea behind the accounting policy change?\n",
            "[00:22:07,260 --> 00:22:17,260]  And I know it is to conform to IFRS, but the accounting principle behind the relative fair value method as opposed to the residual method, what is that?\n",
            "[00:22:18,260 --> 00:22:19,260]  Okay. Thank you.\n",
            "[00:22:19,260 --> 00:22:35,740]  Regarding the first question, the CapEx, as for 2014, because the NCC is not going to auction the 4G license until the fourth quarter of this year.\n",
            "[00:22:36,740 --> 00:22:41,740]  So it is not clear to us how much spectrum we can get.\n",
            "[00:22:42,740 --> 00:22:47,740]  So it is very hard to predict the CapEx level we will have in 2014.\n",
            "[00:22:47,740 --> 00:22:58,740]  But in 2013, the increase of the CapEx reflects a very strong demand for data for this year.\n",
            "[00:22:59,740 --> 00:23:06,740]  But I believe the HSPA plus CapEx will be the highest this year compared.\n",
            "[00:23:07,740 --> 00:23:21,740]  I mean 2014, I think the CapEx allocated for 3G will be lower compared with this year because we will expect to spend some CapEx in the 4G.\n",
            "[00:23:22,740 --> 00:23:29,740]  But as I said, we don't know how much spectrum we are going to get and we don't know which frequency band we are going to get.\n",
            "[00:23:29,740 --> 00:23:36,740]  So it is very hard to predict. But 3G CapEx this year, I think will be the highest.\n",
            "[00:23:37,740 --> 00:23:39,020]  Okay. Alright. Thank you.\n",
            "[00:23:40,020 --> 00:23:50,020]  Okay. On your second question on the accounting policy change, if you go to the website of IASB,\n",
            "[00:23:51,020 --> 00:24:13,020]  now currently Fair Value Method has been clearly mentioned on its website that it could be implemented formally as a guideline for all of the operators to follow.\n",
            "[00:24:14,020 --> 00:24:27,020]  So once it's announced as a formal rule instead of an exposure draft at this stage, it could be implemented soon.\n",
            "[00:24:28,020 --> 00:24:40,020]  And though it will allow some grace period for the operators who haven't readied themselves for the change,\n",
            "[00:24:41,020 --> 00:24:50,020]  since we have been preparing for this change for some time and our system is not ready for the change.\n",
            "[00:24:51,020 --> 00:25:07,020]  So that's why we propose to change the accounting policy for bundled cells to reflect more fairly the operating results of our operation.\n",
            "[00:25:08,020 --> 00:25:10,340]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:25:12,710 --> 00:25:15,710]  Our next question comes from Lucy Liu of JP Morgan Hong Kong. Please go ahead.\n",
            "[00:25:16,710 --> 00:25:19,710]  Hi. Thank you very much. So I have two questions.\n",
            "[00:25:20,710 --> 00:25:28,710]  One is on your smartphone strategy this year. Just a wonder that what's the general focus and new promotion strategy?\n",
            "[00:25:29,710 --> 00:25:33,710]  Are you going to also migrate more from low-end 2G customer to 3G?\n",
            "[00:25:34,710 --> 00:25:37,710]  Because you just mentioned that your mid to low-end smartphone mix actually is reduced.\n",
            "[00:25:37,710 --> 00:25:42,710]  So is that going to be more focusing on high-end smartphone devices in future?\n",
            "[00:25:43,710 --> 00:25:44,710]  So this is my first question.\n",
            "[00:25:45,710 --> 00:25:53,710]  Second one is on your cable business. So just a wonder how ‚Äì what's the outlook in, say, 2013, 14-ish in terms of the growth?\n",
            "[00:25:54,710 --> 00:26:01,710]  So we know that, you know, Chunhua IPTV and these ‚Äì IPTV is another tariff cut pressure.\n",
            "[00:26:01,710 --> 00:26:08,710]  And whether people want to keep a certain discount to the IPTV so that you have the pricing pressure in future too?\n",
            "[00:26:09,710 --> 00:26:17,710]  And also how about a strategy in terms of a rezoning, like entering to the other province ‚Äì sorry, other areas to provide the cable service?\n",
            "[00:26:18,710 --> 00:26:19,710]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:26:21,320 --> 00:26:28,320]  For the first question, the smartphone strategy, we see ‚Äì we are going to sell more smartphone this year than last year.\n",
            "[00:26:29,320 --> 00:26:36,320]  And the ‚Äì there are more increase in the low-end and the middle-end smartphone.\n",
            "[00:26:37,320 --> 00:26:42,320]  And so we see that we will further penetrate the low-end and middle-end sector.\n",
            "[00:26:43,320 --> 00:26:48,320]  But we still see some ‚Äì still fairly strong demand in the high-end sector.\n",
            "[00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:59,320]  Because the ‚Äì obviously Android smartphone has been ‚Äì the high-end Android smartphone has been very successful in getting market share from iPhone.\n",
            "[00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:15,320]  And as for the cable business, even though CHT is aggressively pushing the MOD, but according to their forecast, it will grow like 200,000 this year.\n",
            "[00:27:15,320 --> 00:27:21,320]  We don't see that present a particularly strong threat in the near term.\n",
            "[00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:31,320]  Because our cable business in the analog side ‚Äì in analog cable business side, the growth has been slowed down.\n",
            "[00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:40,320]  The slowdown is partly due to when all the cable TV operator are pushing the digital cable TV.\n",
            "[00:27:41,320 --> 00:27:46,320]  Right now, the high-definition has become a very attractive option.\n",
            "[00:27:47,320 --> 00:27:50,320]  And only digital TV can have high-definition TV.\n",
            "[00:27:51,320 --> 00:28:02,320]  So this year, the capex level in the cable side is higher due to the government requirement to have certain digital TV penetration level.\n",
            "[00:28:03,320 --> 00:28:04,320]  So we need to reach that level.\n",
            "[00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:09,320]  And in order to reach that level, we will aggressively push digital TV.\n",
            "[00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:16,320]  And our digital TV growth rate is even higher than MOD ‚Äì is much higher than MOD.\n",
            "[00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:27,320]  So regarding the rezoning and the competition, I don't see this strong competition kicking in at least for the next six months.\n",
            "[00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:36,320]  Because the NCC, even though there are new applications for cable TV license currently reviewed by NCC,\n",
            "[00:28:37,320 --> 00:28:52,320]  but there are a lot of conditions and terms the NCC needs to define in order to ensure the new applicants can meet what NCC would like to see.\n",
            "[00:28:53,320 --> 00:29:00,320]  So up to now, I don't see the new entrants will present a great threat, at least for this year.\n",
            "[00:29:01,320 --> 00:29:11,320]  So the more cable TV business for this year, I think digital TV will grow very fast, and the high-speed broadband will grow very fast.\n",
            "[00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:22,320]  So from my point of view, we do have a pretty good cable TV business for this year.\n",
            "[00:29:23,320 --> 00:29:26,860]  Thank you. Can I just add one more question?\n",
            "[00:29:26,860 --> 00:29:36,860]  On your EBITDA margin, because I saw the monthly data trend in last year, except January and December, when you had quite strong impact from iPhone.\n",
            "[00:29:37,860 --> 00:29:41,860]  Other months, almost EBITDA margin stabilized at 29 to 30 percent.\n",
            "[00:29:42,860 --> 00:29:48,860]  But it seems like you are forecasting 2013 EBITDA margin guidance is about 27 percent only.\n",
            "[00:29:48,860 --> 00:29:56,860]  We understand that iPhone 5 impact this time should be quite short-lived because the supply in December was quite sufficient.\n",
            "[00:29:57,860 --> 00:30:02,860]  So I just wonder what's the rationale behind this lower EBITDA margin guidance? Thank you.\n",
            "[00:30:03,860 --> 00:30:28,320]  On the EBITDA margin contraction, it's a combination of accounting policy change and more handset sales and also increasing MOMO's revenue.\n",
            "[00:30:29,320 --> 00:30:30,320]  Okay. Thank you.\n",
            "[00:30:33,340 --> 00:30:34,340]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:30:35,340 --> 00:30:40,710]  Thank you. The next question comes from Stephen Lau of Standard Charter Hong Kong. Please go ahead.\n",
            "[00:30:41,710 --> 00:30:43,710]  Okay. Thank you. I have only one question regarding the MOMO.\n",
            "[00:30:44,710 --> 00:30:49,710]  I think you don't give guidance on the MOMO revenue for 2013.\n",
            "[00:30:50,710 --> 00:30:55,710]  I just wonder what your strategy for MOMO is the growth or the profitability for this year?\n",
            "[00:30:56,710 --> 00:31:01,710]  Do you have any target EBITDA margin for MOMO for this year? Thank you.\n",
            "[00:31:02,710 --> 00:31:11,780]  The economy seems it's getting better.\n",
            "[00:31:12,780 --> 00:31:19,780]  At least most of the people think that economy in Taiwan in 2013 will be better than 2012.\n",
            "[00:31:20,780 --> 00:31:25,780]  And last year and this year we still see very strong growth in the Internet shopping.\n",
            "[00:31:26,780 --> 00:31:28,780]  So basically that is a good business.\n",
            "[00:31:28,780 --> 00:31:33,780]  And the TV shopping may recover based on MOMO's current budget.\n",
            "[00:31:34,780 --> 00:31:47,780]  Okay. So I think if we recover TV shopping and we have strong Internet shopping, the EBITDA will improve to a certain extent.\n",
            "[00:31:48,780 --> 00:31:51,780]  As for margin, I will turn to Rosie to answer that.\n",
            "[00:31:52,780 --> 00:31:59,140]  The EBITDA margin for this year is forecasted to be flat-ish.\n",
            "[00:32:00,140 --> 00:32:11,140]  Because you know that Internet shopping also, despite its strong growth, it also will introduce a big increase in cost.\n",
            "[00:32:12,140 --> 00:32:16,140]  So we expect that to be kind of flat-ish.\n",
            "[00:32:17,140 --> 00:32:20,510]  Maybe one more question.\n",
            "[00:32:21,510 --> 00:32:25,510]  I think by the end of the year, the government will auction the new spectrum.\n",
            "[00:32:26,510 --> 00:32:31,510]  I think given your cash position, maybe you need to raise some money fundraising.\n",
            "[00:32:32,510 --> 00:32:35,510]  Do you have any plan to borrow more money this year?\n",
            "[00:32:36,510 --> 00:32:47,120]  I think we certainly will have plans to borrow more money for the auction.\n",
            "[00:32:48,120 --> 00:32:59,120]  But it's actually very difficult for us to plan too much ahead because we don't know how much the auction will cost us.\n",
            "[00:33:00,120 --> 00:33:04,120]  So we are just preparing for a certain amount.\n",
            "[00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:15,120]  You may have noticed that we have already issued a new straight bound late last year for $9 billion.\n",
            "[00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:19,120]  And we will also do so.\n",
            "[00:33:20,120 --> 00:33:33,890]  And that's actually in line with the board approval that we got last year in the fourth quarter.\n",
            "[00:33:36,390 --> 00:33:37,390]  Okay, thank you.\n",
            "[00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:43,600]  Thank you. Next question comes from Jingjing Wen of UBS China. Please go ahead.\n",
            "[00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:46,630]  Thank you. I have two questions.\n",
            "[00:33:46,630 --> 00:33:50,630]  One is regarding your 2013 forecast.\n",
            "[00:33:51,630 --> 00:33:58,630]  You are forecasting a higher revenue growth as well as EBITDA growth, of course, based on the residual value method.\n",
            "[00:33:59,630 --> 00:34:08,630]  I'm just wondering what's the key drivers for both forecast and what's the upside and downside risks in your opinion?\n",
            "[00:34:09,630 --> 00:34:14,630]  Second question regarding the spinoff of your self-owned distribution channel.\n",
            "[00:34:14,630 --> 00:34:19,630]  Have you done any exercise regarding what's the implication on your operational cost?\n",
            "[00:34:20,630 --> 00:34:23,630]  Will that lead to any cost saving?\n",
            "[00:34:24,630 --> 00:34:31,630]  And of course, I assume it will probably also bring in some additional revenue streams.\n",
            "[00:34:32,630 --> 00:34:40,610]  The key driver for revenue growth is still mobile data.\n",
            "[00:34:41,610 --> 00:34:47,640]  Okay, so we expect the mobile data will still grow very strongly for 2013.\n",
            "[00:34:48,930 --> 00:34:54,820]  And plus, I think that's a major thing.\n",
            "[00:34:55,820 --> 00:35:07,660]  Regarding the spinoff of the retail operation, of course, based on our internal calculation, there will be cost saving.\n",
            "[00:35:08,660 --> 00:35:27,340]  But we also are expecting that because of the spinoff, this operation will pursue certain new opportunities which will increase the revenue and the profit in the long run.\n",
            "[00:35:28,340 --> 00:35:34,700]  Okay, thank you. Just a follow-up question.\n",
            "[00:35:35,700 --> 00:35:41,700]  Regarding your revenue growth forecast, do you see any potential upside or downside?\n",
            "[00:35:41,700 --> 00:35:54,100]  The revenue growth, I don't see particularly.\n",
            "[00:35:55,100 --> 00:36:04,860]  Yeah, I think the regulatory environment is a big issue.\n",
            "[00:36:04,860 --> 00:36:19,500]  Okay, if we have certain assumptions regarding the regulatory intervention, how much revenue will be lost due to the regulatory intervention?\n",
            "[00:36:20,500 --> 00:36:28,500]  But this assumption is based on our internal calculation, but things may happen differently.\n",
            "[00:36:28,500 --> 00:36:42,660]  But as for mobile data side, I don't see there is a downside or particularly strong upside because I think the growth rate is roughly okay.\n",
            "[00:36:43,660 --> 00:36:45,260]  Okay, thank you.\n",
            "[00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:52,280]  Thank you. Our next question comes from Joseph Quinn of Macquarie, Taipei. Please go ahead.\n",
            "[00:36:53,570 --> 00:36:56,570]  Thank you, Cliff and Rosie, for the opportunity to ask a few questions.\n",
            "[00:36:57,570 --> 00:37:00,570]  I have a few bigger picture ones and some a bit more focused.\n",
            "[00:37:01,570 --> 00:37:08,570]  In terms of the first one on the IFRS, can I just check with you, is this something that you expect your peers to be adopting?\n",
            "[00:37:09,570 --> 00:37:12,570]  Obviously, I don't need you to comment on their actual adoption, but do they need to adopt it?\n",
            "[00:37:13,570 --> 00:37:20,570]  And if not, can I get a bit of a thought into your reasoning behind choosing this fair value over residual value? That's the first one.\n",
            "[00:37:21,570 --> 00:37:24,570]  The second one is a bit on the cable side.\n",
            "[00:37:24,570 --> 00:37:31,570]  You mentioned that expanding into other areas will obviously come with a high level of NCC requirements, etc.\n",
            "[00:37:32,570 --> 00:37:36,570]  I just wonder from your context, would you be looking to expand that?\n",
            "[00:37:37,570 --> 00:37:45,570]  Or does some of the pending cable issues maybe cause some conflicts there that you probably at this stage are not looking at that side of things?\n",
            "[00:37:46,570 --> 00:37:51,570]  On the MOMO side, this is more of a relation to your spinoff of the retail business, actually.\n",
            "[00:37:51,570 --> 00:37:58,570]  How does that tie in with MOMO, given that they do have their own retail locations and obviously their own retail business as well?\n",
            "[00:37:59,570 --> 00:38:06,570]  Is that something that you'll be looking to tie in together as well, given there obviously would be strong synergies between the two?\n",
            "[00:38:07,570 --> 00:38:10,570]  On the CAPEX side, you did mention there'll be some deferring of payments.\n",
            "[00:38:11,570 --> 00:38:18,570]  Can we get a bit of color on that and how it influences the actual uptick in CAPEX that we're seeing in 2013's guidance?\n",
            "[00:38:19,570 --> 00:38:22,570]  And lastly is on the NFC side.\n",
            "[00:38:23,570 --> 00:38:28,570]  There is obviously a recent announcement in terms of a JV between yourself and peers, an EasyCard.\n",
            "[00:38:29,570 --> 00:38:34,570]  I just want to get a bit of input on that side of the business and what you're thinking there in terms of timetables.\n",
            "[00:38:35,570 --> 00:38:45,570]  And also in addition to how you see that working with the Amcommerce, given that was obviously a key topic that you had discussed with acquisition of MOMO.\n",
            "[00:38:46,570 --> 00:38:49,570]  Sorry for the long questions, but I look forward to the responses.\n",
            "[00:38:50,570 --> 00:39:03,180]  On the IFRS question you just raised, as far as I understand, Chung-Han just had their conference call with you guys.\n",
            "[00:39:04,180 --> 00:39:11,180]  They haven't decided to adopt relative fair value methods, at least not for this year.\n",
            "[00:39:12,180 --> 00:39:25,180]  But once it becomes a rule, a formal rule instead of a draft, everybody will have to follow IASB's ruling.\n",
            "[00:39:26,180 --> 00:39:37,180]  So I don't think they could be spared to use relative fair value methods.\n",
            "[00:39:38,180 --> 00:39:44,180]  Just to confirm, you're basically pre-empting that this will be something they have to do anyway?\n",
            "[00:39:45,180 --> 00:39:50,180]  Yes, because it's being published on IASB's website already.\n",
            "[00:39:51,180 --> 00:39:57,460]  They will change the exposure draft into a formal rule this year.\n",
            "[00:39:58,460 --> 00:40:00,460]  That makes it a lot clearer. Thanks.\n",
            "[00:40:01,460 --> 00:40:13,260]  Yes, they actually mentioned on the website that it will be in the first half of this year in their exposure draft on the website.\n",
            "[00:40:15,260 --> 00:40:16,260]  Thanks.\n",
            "[00:40:17,540 --> 00:40:23,540]  Regarding whether our cable business will expand to other regions, currently under the law,\n",
            "[00:40:24,540 --> 00:40:33,700]  the NCC considers Taiwan Mobile and Cabro as the same group.\n",
            "[00:40:34,700 --> 00:40:40,700]  So Taiwan Mobile cable business plus Cabro currently own roughly one third.\n",
            "[00:40:40,700 --> 00:40:46,700]  Unless NCC changes its interpretation of the size of the market,\n",
            "[00:40:47,700 --> 00:40:50,700]  we are not allowed to enter other regions.\n",
            "[00:40:51,700 --> 00:40:55,700]  If we are allowed to enter other regions, we are going to hit more than one third.\n",
            "[00:40:56,700 --> 00:41:03,180]  So sorry, this is a stance that the NCC is taking even though you're not formally merged,\n",
            "[00:41:04,180 --> 00:41:06,180]  but because you're a similar group, they put you together.\n",
            "[00:41:07,180 --> 00:41:24,180]  But now, based on the law, NCC is thinking whether they should include MOD as part of this cable market.\n",
            "[00:41:25,180 --> 00:41:34,660]  So if they include MOD, then Taiwan Mobile plus Cabro doesn't consist of one third.\n",
            "[00:41:34,660 --> 00:41:37,660]  So we are free to enter any region.\n",
            "[00:41:38,660 --> 00:41:46,660]  This is one consideration that NCC needs to decide and give us a clear interpretation.\n",
            "[00:41:47,660 --> 00:41:53,660]  What do you think would drive the NCC towards becoming more proactive and including MOD subs?\n",
            "[00:41:54,660 --> 00:41:57,660]  Based on our understanding with NCC,\n",
            "[00:41:58,660 --> 00:42:06,660]  I think NCC in general agrees with the concept that MOD is part of the cable\n",
            "[00:42:07,660 --> 00:42:11,660]  because MOD provides a similar service to the subscribers.\n",
            "[00:42:12,660 --> 00:42:17,820]  So in general, they agree with the concept.\n",
            "[00:42:18,820 --> 00:42:25,050]  It's just that they haven't come up with this kind of interpretation\n",
            "[00:42:26,050 --> 00:42:29,050]  or written in the paper that they agree with that.\n",
            "[00:42:30,050 --> 00:42:37,050]  So this is the reason why there are people applying to enter other regions to serve,\n",
            "[00:42:38,050 --> 00:42:44,050]  but there are certain measures and the conditions and rules that NCC hasn't clarified yet.\n",
            "[00:42:45,050 --> 00:42:54,050]  So NCC needs to clarify those rules in order to approve the new applicants to enter other regions to operate.\n",
            "[00:42:55,050 --> 00:43:02,170]  As for the third question you raised, MOD will have roughly 50 or 60 shops.\n",
            "[00:43:03,170 --> 00:43:08,170]  Currently, we haven't talked about how to work with them.\n",
            "[00:43:09,170 --> 00:43:17,170]  So I don't think this is something we have in mind in the near future.\n",
            "[00:43:26,250 --> 00:43:27,250]  Joseph, do you have any follow-up questions?\n",
            "[00:43:28,250 --> 00:43:32,250]  Yes, sorry. There was also a question on the deferred CAPEX and also on the NFC.\n",
            "[00:43:33,250 --> 00:43:44,460]  Oh, you're talking about the difference between cash CAPEX and our cash-cashed budgets, right?\n",
            "[00:43:44,460 --> 00:43:45,460]  Correct, yes.\n",
            "[00:43:46,460 --> 00:43:56,940]  There are just some payments that haven't been made, and it happens every year, actually.\n",
            "[00:43:57,940 --> 00:44:07,940]  We sometimes need more time to confirm that the work is properly done\n",
            "[00:44:08,940 --> 00:44:14,940]  or the equipment is properly delivered and set up.\n",
            "[00:44:15,940 --> 00:44:18,940]  So there's always situations like this every year.\n",
            "[00:44:19,940 --> 00:44:27,940]  Okay, so I should take the 11.8 bill of 2012 as the more firm actual CAPEX input that was done for that year,\n",
            "[00:44:28,940 --> 00:44:29,940]  just as deferment and payment.\n",
            "[00:44:31,350 --> 00:44:37,050]  And Cliff, could you give me a bit of insight into your thoughts on the NFCs,\n",
            "[00:44:37,050 --> 00:44:40,050]  particularly on how that would work for MOMO as well?\n",
            "[00:44:41,050 --> 00:44:50,080]  As you know, the government has approved the formation of the Fair Trade Commission,\n",
            "[00:44:51,080 --> 00:44:54,080]  has approved the setup of this NFC consortium.\n",
            "[00:44:55,080 --> 00:44:59,080]  And I think the company will be incorporated in the second quarter of this year.\n",
            "[00:45:00,080 --> 00:45:03,080]  And it takes a certain time to build the system.\n",
            "[00:45:03,080 --> 00:45:13,080]  So I think the company can only provide the NFC services roughly at the end of this year.\n",
            "[00:45:14,080 --> 00:45:22,080]  So the revenue and the business opportunity will not be a factor until, I think, next year.\n",
            "[00:45:23,080 --> 00:45:27,180]  How would you see MOMO utilizing this,\n",
            "[00:45:27,180 --> 00:45:35,180]  or do you think it's something more directed towards the Taiwan Mobile customers themselves or subscribers?\n",
            "[00:45:36,180 --> 00:45:43,170]  We are also working on how to leverage this NFC opportunity.\n",
            "[00:45:44,170 --> 00:45:53,170]  So I think Taiwan Mobile will have a better usage of this NFC technology than MOMO.\n",
            "[00:45:54,170 --> 00:45:58,200]  Okay. That's great. Thank you very much.\n",
            "[00:45:59,200 --> 00:46:05,380]  Thank you. Next, we have a follow-up question from Jay Ben of Credit Suisse Hong Kong. Please go ahead.\n",
            "[00:46:06,380 --> 00:46:08,380]  Thank you very much for your time.\n",
            "[00:46:09,380 --> 00:46:11,380]  Sorry for all the housekeeping questions.\n",
            "[00:46:12,380 --> 00:46:13,380]  The first one is regarding smartphone penetration.\n",
            "[00:46:14,380 --> 00:46:17,380]  I just want to confirm where you end the year with in terms of smartphone penetration.\n",
            "[00:46:18,380 --> 00:46:20,380]  The second question is regarding your guidance again.\n",
            "[00:46:20,380 --> 00:46:29,380]  I understand that on EBITDA net profit, you built in the impact from interconnection reduction of around $400 million, $0.4 billion.\n",
            "[00:46:30,380 --> 00:46:36,380]  Any guidance in terms of the tariff reduction, the impact on that?\n",
            "[00:46:37,380 --> 00:46:40,380]  I understand that it has not been finalized. I just want to hear your thoughts.\n",
            "[00:46:41,380 --> 00:46:43,380]  The third one is related to CapEx again.\n",
            "[00:46:44,380 --> 00:46:53,380]  So would I be right if I just take FY2013 CapEx budget and just minus that by $3.0 billion,\n",
            "[00:46:54,380 --> 00:47:04,380]  defer from FY2012 and derive a net CapEx budget of $9.1 billion for FY2013 instead of $12.8 billion? Thank you.\n",
            "[00:47:15,460 --> 00:47:20,460]  I think we have mentioned somewhere in our presentation.\n",
            "[00:47:20,460 --> 00:47:24,460]  The mobile data adoption rate already.\n",
            "[00:47:25,460 --> 00:47:37,460]  So we don't think smartphone penetration is a better indication of our mobile Internet business than this one.\n",
            "[00:47:38,460 --> 00:47:41,460]  So we will not disclose smartphone penetration anymore.\n",
            "[00:47:42,460 --> 00:47:53,860]  The target for mobile Internet is on page 14, right?\n",
            "[00:47:54,860 --> 00:48:01,910]  Sorry, it is 59% for this year from 41% last year.\n",
            "[00:48:02,910 --> 00:48:05,220]  Okay, perfect.\n",
            "[00:48:05,220 --> 00:48:25,690]  On your CapEx question, our CapEx for this year is $12.8 billion for this year.\n",
            "[00:48:26,690 --> 00:48:31,690]  So you don't need to do any further revision or recalculation.\n",
            "[00:48:32,690 --> 00:48:36,690]  So does FY2012 include or not include the delay in payment?\n",
            "[00:48:37,690 --> 00:48:39,690]  No, it doesn't.\n",
            "[00:48:39,690 --> 00:48:41,690]  It doesn't include any delayed payment.\n",
            "[00:48:42,690 --> 00:48:46,690]  Delayed payment belongs to the last year's CapEx.\n",
            "[00:48:47,690 --> 00:48:51,690]  Okay, so last year's CapEx is still $11.8 billion and this year is $12.8 billion. So it is a $1 billion increase.\n",
            "[00:48:52,690 --> 00:48:54,230]  Yes, it is around the number.\n",
            "[00:48:55,230 --> 00:48:56,230]  Yes, thank you.\n",
            "[00:48:59,440 --> 00:49:03,440]  Thank you. Our next question comes from Matthew Wolfe of Capital World Hong Kong. Please go ahead.\n",
            "[00:49:04,440 --> 00:49:07,860]  Hi, I guess three questions for me.\n",
            "[00:49:07,860 --> 00:49:10,860]  The first is on operating leverage.\n",
            "[00:49:11,860 --> 00:49:18,860]  And as you point out in the first slide, you're seeing significant revenue growth for the first time in a few years.\n",
            "[00:49:19,860 --> 00:49:23,860]  But that's not coming through in margins, particularly in the consumer business group.\n",
            "[00:49:24,860 --> 00:49:29,860]  And I was wondering if you could talk through about why that's the case and when you expect to see more operating leverage.\n",
            "[00:49:30,860 --> 00:49:31,860]  So that's the first question.\n",
            "[00:49:32,860 --> 00:49:34,860]  The second question is on mobile data competition.\n",
            "[00:49:34,860 --> 00:49:42,860]  Can you talk a little bit about the state of competition, particularly on mobile data pricing?\n",
            "[00:49:43,860 --> 00:49:46,860]  And the third is on the fair value versus the residual value.\n",
            "[00:49:47,860 --> 00:49:51,860]  Can you remind us how you account for handset costs?\n",
            "[00:49:52,860 --> 00:49:56,860]  And does this change imply any change in accounting for handset costs?\n",
            "[00:49:57,860 --> 00:49:58,860]  Thanks.\n",
            "[00:49:58,860 --> 00:50:32,810]  As for the first question, even though we see strong growth for this year, but due to the regulatory intervention, we would lose certain revenue in the profit every year.\n",
            "[00:50:33,810 --> 00:50:37,810]  That's one issue, so that our profit would be under pressure.\n",
            "[00:50:38,810 --> 00:50:54,810]  The second issue is that even though we see strong growth in revenue, but with the subsidy level, the subsidy amount for each year is higher and higher.\n",
            "[00:50:55,810 --> 00:51:04,810]  So how to manage the subsidy level and the amount is a key consideration or key strategy for 2013 and 2014.\n",
            "[00:51:04,810 --> 00:51:11,810]  And I think this is an issue that all the major operators in Taiwan need to address.\n",
            "[00:51:12,810 --> 00:51:21,810]  And we will try to lower our subsidy and try to see whether we can have some success starting from this year.\n",
            "[00:51:22,810 --> 00:51:28,810]  Let me elaborate a little bit on the operating leverage question you just raised.\n",
            "[00:51:29,810 --> 00:51:50,810]  Basically, if without accounting policy change, on an ROC gap basis, our telecom revenue will grow 7%, and the consolidated operating profit will grow by 5%.\n",
            "[00:51:51,810 --> 00:52:02,810]  Because of some increase in asset write-off, the net profit will only grow by 1%.\n",
            "[00:52:03,810 --> 00:52:09,810]  So there is operating leverage if without accounting policy change.\n",
            "[00:52:11,100 --> 00:52:17,100]  And on your third question of handset costs, they are the same on both basis.\n",
            "[00:52:18,100 --> 00:52:31,510]  Regarding the mobile data competition, since Taiwan still has this all-you-can-eat pricing, and most likely this will not be changed until they launch out the 4G.\n",
            "[00:52:32,510 --> 00:52:39,510]  So I don't see there's a tremendous difference in pricing for the coming year.\n",
            "[00:52:40,510 --> 00:52:48,180]  So I think the competition will stay the same. The pricing will stay the same.\n",
            "[00:52:49,180 --> 00:52:53,340]  If I can ask just a couple of follow-ups on that.\n",
            "[00:52:54,340 --> 00:53:01,340]  I guess on the first point, on the revenue growth and the handset subsidies,\n",
            "[00:53:02,340 --> 00:53:10,340]  eventually in the handset adoption curve, you reach a point where the incremental subsidies starts to decline.\n",
            "[00:53:11,340 --> 00:53:23,340]  And you're sort of approaching, I realize you're not disclosing it anymore, but you're probably approaching the 30s to 40% smartphone penetration.\n",
            "[00:53:24,340 --> 00:53:29,340]  So when do you see that point at which the incremental subsidies is not growing?\n",
            "[00:53:29,340 --> 00:53:31,340]  That's the first question.\n",
            "[00:53:32,340 --> 00:53:41,340]  The second one, just to follow up on the accounting policy, just can you confirm on the cost side, so do you expense it upfront fully or do you amortize it?\n",
            "[00:53:42,340 --> 00:53:43,340]  Fully.\n",
            "[00:53:44,340 --> 00:53:45,340]  Expense fully.\n",
            "[00:53:46,340 --> 00:53:47,340]  On both basis.\n",
            "[00:53:48,340 --> 00:53:49,760]  Okay.\n",
            "[00:53:50,860 --> 00:53:55,860]  And, okay, so on that first question, on the operating leverage question.\n",
            "[00:53:55,860 --> 00:54:03,430]  Well, these incremental, we don't see, we do see incremental revenue for 2013.\n",
            "[00:54:04,430 --> 00:54:17,430]  As far as when it will happen, we don't know because the price, the handset prices become, the handset vendors are competing aggressively.\n",
            "[00:54:18,430 --> 00:54:22,430]  So this year and the next year, we see more and more products.\n",
            "[00:54:23,430 --> 00:54:28,430]  And there is a very strong pressure to drive down the handset price.\n",
            "[00:54:29,430 --> 00:54:30,430]  And you have new players.\n",
            "[00:54:30,430 --> 00:54:52,560]  Therefore, if the price of the handset can be lower, and if we can cut down the subsidy level, then these incremental revenue will grow in 2014 or even beyond.\n",
            "[00:54:53,560 --> 00:54:59,560]  So it's a mixture of factors, and it's very hard for me to say at the moment.\n",
            "[00:55:00,560 --> 00:55:10,230]  But as far as I can see for next year, for this year, clearly we do see incremental revenue for this year.\n",
            "[00:55:11,230 --> 00:55:33,230]  And Cliff, just on the data point when you were answering that, towards the end of last year, there started to be some promotions in the market where customers could get large amounts of data, maybe a gig or enough to use on an iPhone, for significantly cheaper than the $6.99 that it used to be.\n",
            "[00:55:34,230 --> 00:55:36,230]  Are those promotions continuing in the market?\n",
            "[00:55:37,230 --> 00:55:38,230]  Yes.\n",
            "[00:55:38,230 --> 00:55:39,230]  Or have they started to relax?\n",
            "[00:55:40,900 --> 00:55:41,900]  They are still in the market.\n",
            "[00:55:42,900 --> 00:55:55,900]  But even though you have these lower price with a big data package, but most of the people still chose to have all-you-can-eat.\n",
            "[00:55:56,900 --> 00:56:01,880]  And the all-you-can-eat is not at a discount?\n",
            "[00:56:02,880 --> 00:56:05,230]  No, it's not at any discount.\n",
            "[00:56:06,230 --> 00:56:07,230]  Okay, got it. Thank you.\n",
            "[00:56:08,230 --> 00:56:13,460]  And I just want to elaborate a little bit on the accounting policy change.\n",
            "[00:56:13,460 --> 00:56:19,460]  I don't know whether you have read our last page of the presentation materials.\n",
            "[00:56:20,460 --> 00:56:27,460]  It shows clearly how revenues during the contract period will be allocated.\n",
            "[00:56:28,460 --> 00:56:44,870]  If you have looked at it, you will find that actually the revenue during the contract period remains the same if you compare that to the residual value method.\n",
            "[00:56:45,870 --> 00:56:52,870]  And also the profit during the contract period in total will also be the same.\n",
            "[00:56:52,870 --> 00:57:01,870]  It's just an allocation of revenue and profit during different periods.\n",
            "[00:57:02,900 --> 00:57:06,900]  But during the contract period, the total revenue and profit are the same.\n",
            "[00:57:07,900 --> 00:57:13,420]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:57:15,020 --> 00:57:19,020]  Thank you. Our next question comes from Sydney Han of Band of America Hong Kong.\n",
            "[00:57:20,020 --> 00:57:21,020]  Please go ahead. Thank you.\n",
            "[00:57:22,570 --> 00:57:23,570]  Thanks, Sydney Chan.\n",
            "[00:57:24,570 --> 00:57:25,570]  I have two questions.\n",
            "[00:57:25,570 --> 00:57:28,570]  One question is on the cable business.\n",
            "[00:57:29,570 --> 00:57:34,570]  You said the cable digital TV and high-definition TV will grow very quickly this year.\n",
            "[00:57:35,570 --> 00:57:43,570]  I just wonder when subscribers move from analog TV or cable TV to digital TV, what's the output impact?\n",
            "[00:57:44,570 --> 00:57:48,570]  How much incremental output you can get and what's the impact to the cable EBITDA margin?\n",
            "[00:57:49,570 --> 00:57:50,660]  That's one question.\n",
            "[00:57:51,660 --> 00:57:54,660]  The second one is on the IFRS adjustments.\n",
            "[00:57:55,660 --> 00:58:03,660]  Will you provide more retrospective numbers and data for us for the last couple of years for restated financials?\n",
            "[00:58:04,660 --> 00:58:09,660]  And also in the future, will you report the output before and after the adjustments?\n",
            "[00:58:10,660 --> 00:58:12,140]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:58:13,140 --> 00:58:15,140]  We will take that into account.\n",
            "[00:58:16,140 --> 00:58:24,140]  We will only disclose some year-on-year numbers for your comparison this year.\n",
            "[00:58:24,140 --> 00:58:41,240]  Because we are only required to provide 2012 numbers on a pro forma basis for regulatory fulfillment.\n",
            "[00:58:42,240 --> 00:58:49,240]  So that's why we only compare 2013 with 2012.\n",
            "[00:58:50,240 --> 00:58:59,100]  And it's very time-consuming and labor-intensive to come up with the retroactive numbers.\n",
            "[00:59:00,100 --> 00:59:02,100]  So it's kind of difficult for us to do so.\n",
            "[00:59:03,100 --> 00:59:05,100]  I hope you understand our position.\n",
            "[00:59:06,100 --> 00:59:21,550]  On the cable TV, with the DTV, the ARPU will grow by roughly 130 NT.\n",
            "[00:59:22,550 --> 00:59:23,550]  It's on page 6.\n",
            "[00:59:38,090 --> 00:59:39,090]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:59:42,230 --> 00:59:45,230]  Our next question comes from Gary Yu of Mobile Standing Hong Kong.\n",
            "[00:59:46,230 --> 00:59:48,970]  Hi, thanks for the opportunity to ask questions.\n",
            "[00:59:49,970 --> 00:59:52,970]  I just have one question regarding your 2013 guidance.\n",
            "[00:59:53,970 --> 00:59:55,970]  Excuse me, can you speak louder?\n",
            "[00:59:56,970 --> 00:59:57,970]  Hi, can you hear me?\n",
            "[00:59:58,970 --> 01:00:02,970]  I just have one question regarding your 2013 guidance.\n",
            "[01:00:03,970 --> 01:00:12,970]  It seems like on a like basis, based on the old accounting, you are expecting the service revenue to grow 7% in 2013.\n",
            "[01:00:13,970 --> 01:00:20,970]  Which seems to be an acceleration compared to last year, which was roughly 4% if I'm not wrong.\n",
            "[01:00:21,970 --> 01:00:25,970]  So what is the key driver of this acceleration of growth?\n",
            "[01:00:26,970 --> 01:00:28,970]  Is it more coming from mobile business?\n",
            "[01:00:28,970 --> 01:00:35,970]  And can you also clarify whether this is already incorporating the reduction in interconnect revenue?\n",
            "[01:00:36,970 --> 01:00:43,130]  Which means that on Apple's perspective, the growth rate could be even higher than 7%.\n",
            "[01:00:45,160 --> 01:00:52,160]  Interconnection impact has already been factored in our 2013 guidance, as mentioned earlier.\n",
            "[01:00:53,160 --> 01:01:04,160]  And the increasing revenue is a combination of growth in subscribers and also ARPU.\n",
            "[01:01:05,160 --> 01:01:17,330]  Right, so you expect both growth in subscriber number and ARPU would be even higher than last year, despite the fact on a higher base.\n",
            "[01:01:18,330 --> 01:01:21,330]  Yeah, mostly driven by data revenue growth.\n",
            "[01:01:22,330 --> 01:01:25,150]  Okay, thank you.\n",
            "[01:01:27,530 --> 01:01:31,530]  Thank you. Our next question comes from Joseph Green of Macquarie Taipei. Please go ahead.\n",
            "[01:01:32,530 --> 01:01:34,530]  Thank you. Just a very quick follow-up question.\n",
            "[01:01:35,530 --> 01:01:39,530]  When you're looking at your cable targets for this year, can you give us some insight into what you're looking for?\n",
            "[01:01:40,530 --> 01:01:44,530]  Your internet growth, the cable internet growth, and also the digital TV side. Thanks.\n",
            "[01:01:50,300 --> 01:01:54,300]  Cable broadband growth is expected to grow by 10% this year.\n",
            "[01:01:55,300 --> 01:01:58,780]  DTV is up.\n",
            "[01:03:04,140 --> 01:03:11,140]  Hello. The DTV growth rate, in the fourth quarter, the DTV growth rate is 68%.\n",
            "[01:03:12,140 --> 01:03:21,140]  In the coming year, 2013, because of the government regulations, our cable business will deploy more set-top boxes,\n",
            "[01:03:22,140 --> 01:03:30,180]  even though those set-top boxes are very simple function set-top boxes to increase the penetration rate.\n",
            "[01:03:31,180 --> 01:03:34,180]  So the penetration rate will grow very fast.\n",
            "[01:03:34,180 --> 01:03:45,400]  I think it's going to grow based on, I don't have the number now, but I believe it's going to be 30 or beyond 30% or 40%,\n",
            "[01:03:46,400 --> 01:03:54,400]  because there is a mandate from NCC and the local government to demand to reach a certain percentage.\n",
            "[01:03:55,400 --> 01:04:04,400]  However, when you give this certain digital TV penetration, the output is not going to be high.\n",
            "[01:04:05,400 --> 01:04:11,400]  So don't use the growth rate of the subscriber equal to the growth rate of revenue.\n",
            "[01:04:12,400 --> 01:04:18,400]  Okay. So this is basically providing a digital TV box to a consumer, but not necessarily getting additional revenue from it.\n",
            "[01:04:19,400 --> 01:04:26,400]  Did NCC, did you get particular targets that you need to reach for 2013-2014?\n",
            "[01:04:32,100 --> 01:04:33,100]  40% this year.\n",
            "[01:04:34,100 --> 01:04:38,160]  40% this year. Okay. That's helpful. Thank you.\n",
            "[01:04:39,640 --> 01:04:44,640]  Thank you. Our next question comes from Stephen Law of Standard Chartered Hong Kong. Please go ahead. Thank you.\n",
            "[01:04:45,640 --> 01:04:48,640]  Thank you. A follow-up question on the mobile business.\n",
            "[01:04:48,640 --> 01:04:51,640]  I think overall EBITDA margin will be declining this year.\n",
            "[01:04:52,640 --> 01:04:54,640]  How about the mobile business EBITDA margin for this year?\n",
            "[01:04:55,640 --> 01:04:59,640]  Should it be improving or flat or declining just for the mobile business?\n",
            "[01:05:00,640 --> 01:05:09,460]  If you are talking about ROC gap is up, as I mentioned earlier.\n",
            "[01:05:10,460 --> 01:05:12,460]  Yeah, before the accounting change.\n",
            "[01:05:13,460 --> 01:05:17,460]  Before the accounting change, the telecom revenue will be up by 7%.\n",
            "[01:05:17,460 --> 01:05:20,460]  Yeah. How about EBITDA margin improving will be?\n",
            "[01:05:21,460 --> 01:05:27,690]  EBITDA margin will be up by, let me calculate. Are you talking year on year?\n",
            "[01:05:28,690 --> 01:05:29,690]  Yeah, year on year.\n",
            "[01:05:30,690 --> 01:05:33,690]  I think it's roughly 3%.\n",
            "[01:05:34,690 --> 01:05:38,000]  Up by 3% percentage point.\n",
            "[01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:40,000]  Oh, sorry. 5%.\n",
            "[01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:43,000]  Okay. EBITDA or EBITDA margin?\n",
            "[01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:48,000]  Oh, no, no, no. We are talking about EBITDA margin. Sorry. It's declining. It's declining.\n",
            "[01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:55,290]  Yeah. Why EBITDA margin for mobile business declining because its revenue will be 7% up?\n",
            "[01:05:56,290 --> 01:05:58,290]  Is it due to handset sales?\n",
            "[01:05:59,290 --> 01:06:01,290]  It's because of rising handset sales.\n",
            "[01:06:02,290 --> 01:06:05,290]  Yeah. Okay. Okay. Thank you.\n",
            "[01:06:06,290 --> 01:06:12,730]  Thank you. The next question comes from Lucy Liu of JFME Morgan Hong Kong. Please go ahead.\n",
            "[01:06:13,760 --> 01:06:15,760]  Oh, no. Sorry. My question has been answered. Thanks. Thank you.\n",
            "[01:06:15,760 --> 01:06:20,760]  Once again, ladies and gentlemen, if you would like to register for questions, please press star 1 key now. Thank you.\n",
            "[01:06:21,760 --> 01:06:29,080]  Excuse me, Cliff. There seems to be no further questions at this point in time. Thank you.\n",
            "[01:06:30,080 --> 01:06:34,080]  Okay. Thank everyone to attend this conference.\n",

            "[00:08:14,770 --> 00:08:25,770]  On the ratios, net debt to equity and net debt to EBITDA at the end of the fourth quarter remained at healthy levels.\n",
            "[00:08:25,770 --> 00:08:33,770]  Current ratio came off due to the rise in short-term borrowings as half of corporate balance will mature in 2012.\n",
            "[00:08:33,770 --> 00:08:41,770]  ROE and ROA in fourth quarter stayed at reasonably high levels.\n",

            "[00:10:15,180 --> 00:10:26,180]  The deferral in receiving 3G equipment import approval from NCC also explained the decrease in our cash capex for the year.\n",

            "[00:14:34,850 --> 00:14:45,850]  The euro crisis, though may cause some economic uncertainties, we are cautiously optimistic about year 2012 outlook.\n",
            "[00:14:45,850 --> 00:14:53,850]  As always, enhancing shareholders' returns remains the top priority of the company.\n",
            "[00:14:53,850 --> 00:15:00,880]  Okay, we would like to hand over the floor to any questions.\n",
            "[00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:04,880]  Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, we will now pull for questions.\n",
            "[00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:15,180]  If you would like to register for a question, please press star 1 key on your telephone touchpad. Thank you.\n",
            "[00:15:15,180 --> 00:15:20,180]  Our first question comes from Chad Bancher of Credit Suisse in Hong Kong. Please go ahead.\n",
            "[00:15:20,180 --> 00:15:28,180]  Thank you very much. Congratulations on the FY11 result, and thank you for the conference call.\n",
            "[00:15:28,180 --> 00:15:34,180]  I have in total five questions. The first one is regarding iPhone 4S launch.\n",
            "[00:15:34,180 --> 00:15:38,180]  The impact seems to be higher than iPhone 4.\n",
            "[00:15:38,180 --> 00:15:43,180]  Can you help compare the popularity of iPhone 4S and iPhone 4 a little bit,\n",
            "[00:15:43,180 --> 00:15:48,180]  and whether the impact on margins would continue for how long?\n",
            "[00:15:48,180 --> 00:15:52,180]  The second question is regarding your store expansion plan.\n",
            "[00:15:52,180 --> 00:15:56,180]  You guide that part of the increase in cost would be related to this.\n",
            "[00:15:56,180 --> 00:16:00,180]  It helps explain how much do you have now and how much are you expanding.\n",
            "[00:16:00,180 --> 00:16:03,180]  The third point is regarding the Internet Data Center.\n",
            "[00:16:03,180 --> 00:16:08,180]  How should we view the revenue potential and return on your investment in this?\n",
            "[00:16:08,180 --> 00:16:13,180]  The fourth question is also related to the Internet Data Center.\n",
            "[00:16:13,180 --> 00:16:17,180]  How should we view the CapEx on this beyond 2012?\n",
            "[00:16:17,180 --> 00:16:25,180]  Is this just where you want to be, or actually it's just a first step of a much bigger plan for IDC?\n",
            "[00:16:25,180 --> 00:16:29,180]  And the fifth question is regarding the change in regulatory.\n",
            "[00:16:29,180 --> 00:16:33,180]  How would this affect your dividend policy?\n",
            "[00:16:33,180 --> 00:16:38,180]  Does it mean that you can now declare special dividend instead of doing capital reduction?\n",
            "[00:16:38,180 --> 00:16:42,170]  Thank you very much.\n",
            "[00:16:42,170 --> 00:16:52,170]  So, as for the iPhone 4S, the reason that the iPhone 4S created certain impact\n",
            "[00:16:52,170 --> 00:17:02,170]  in our December financial statement is due to the supply of iPhone 4S is much better than iPhone 4.\n",
            "[00:17:02,170 --> 00:17:10,170]  This is one reason why we are negatively impacted by the iPhone 4S itself.\n",
            "[00:17:10,170 --> 00:17:19,170]  And at this moment, I cannot tell whether iPhone 4S is more popular or less popular than iPhone 4.\n",
            "[00:17:19,170 --> 00:17:27,170]  But we think that the impact of iPhone 4S will affect our first quarter,\n",
            "[00:17:27,170 --> 00:17:34,170]  but the impact will be reduced in second quarter and third quarter\n",
            "[00:17:34,170 --> 00:17:42,170]  because we expect the iPhone 5 may be launched in certain time frame next year.\n",
            "[00:17:42,170 --> 00:17:44,170]  I think maybe third quarter or something like that.\n",
            "[00:17:44,170 --> 00:17:55,170]  So, this year, the iPhone 4S impact will mainly happen in the first quarter of this year.\n",
            "[00:17:55,170 --> 00:18:06,170]  Regarding the store expansion, the total number of stores we are going to have is roughly between 700 to 750.\n",
            "[00:18:06,170 --> 00:18:13,170]  Out of them, maybe 40% is owned by, directly owned by Taiwan Mobile.\n",
            "[00:18:13,170 --> 00:18:17,170]  Then the 50% or 60% is owned by the franchise store.\n",
            "[00:18:17,170 --> 00:18:24,170]  And the expansion will cost around roughly 200 million.\n",
            "[00:18:24,170 --> 00:18:30,610]  The CAPEX is roughly 200 million for this year.\n",
            "[00:18:30,610 --> 00:18:36,610]  As for IDC, let me turn to Rosie.\n",
            "[00:18:36,610 --> 00:18:45,610]  IDC, the CAPEX is mostly, will mostly be spent in 2012\n",
            "[00:18:45,610 --> 00:18:51,610]  because the construction of the IDC is expected to be completed by end of this year.\n",
            "[00:18:51,610 --> 00:18:55,610]  So, the revenue stream will come next year.\n",
            "[00:18:55,610 --> 00:19:03,610]  And beyond 2012, we expect much less CAPEX on IDC.\n",
            "[00:19:03,610 --> 00:19:08,610]  For this IDC in Neihu, we are building.\n",
            "[00:19:19,900 --> 00:19:25,900]  The cloud IDC business case is still evolving.\n",
            "[00:19:25,900 --> 00:19:31,900]  Currently, we have seen a shortage of IDC space in Taiwan\n",
            "[00:19:31,900 --> 00:19:39,900]  because most of the current IDC were built in year 2000, around year 2000.\n",
            "[00:19:39,900 --> 00:19:46,900]  Due to the oversupply of IDC space, so in the last 10 years or 12 years,\n",
            "[00:19:46,900 --> 00:19:52,900]  we didn't see any IDC, new IDC get built during that time frame.\n",
            "[00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:59,900]  So, we are still very positive of the return of IDC.\n",
            "[00:19:59,900 --> 00:20:06,900]  This is one reason we started building the IDC.\n",
            "[00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:16,900]  By the end of this year, we will have a more solid forecast on the return of our IDC.\n",
            "[00:20:16,900 --> 00:20:23,900]  Of course, in general, we have built a business case for this IDC.\n",
            "[00:20:23,900 --> 00:20:27,900]  But as I said, cloud computing is still evolving.\n",
            "[00:20:27,900 --> 00:20:36,900]  Therefore, we will build this IDC and we will revise our business case.\n",
            "[00:20:36,900 --> 00:20:44,900]  So, by the second half of this year, we will have more accurate and precise information to share with you.\n",
            "[00:20:44,900 --> 00:20:55,900]  As to the regulatory change on the potential pool for dividend distribution,\n",
            "[00:20:55,900 --> 00:21:02,900]  the only thing I can share with you is based on our year-end balance,\n",
            "[00:21:02,900 --> 00:21:12,900]  we do have capital surplus of 12.4 billion and return earnings of 3 billion\n",
            "[00:21:12,900 --> 00:21:25,900]  and the excess over a fourth of the paid-in capital in legal reserve will be somewhere around 8.2 billion.\n",
            "[00:21:25,900 --> 00:21:35,090]  So, the pool for dividend distribution is definitely higher.\n",
            "[00:21:35,090 --> 00:21:43,090]  But we did not discuss about the earnings distribution in this morning's board.\n",
            "[00:21:43,090 --> 00:21:49,090]  It will be up for discussion in the next board meeting in April.\n",
            "[00:21:49,090 --> 00:21:54,100]  Thank you very much.\n",
            "[00:21:54,100 --> 00:21:58,100]  Just one follow-up question regarding the store expansion.\n",
            "[00:21:58,100 --> 00:22:04,100]  Currently, how much do you have now and where are you going to get to again?\n",
            "[00:22:04,100 --> 00:22:10,100]  We now have 280 direct-owned stores.\n",
            "[00:22:10,100 --> 00:22:17,100]  Currently, we have 280 direct stores and 356 franchise stores.\n",
            "[00:22:17,100 --> 00:22:25,100]  So, in total, we plan to have around 700 to 750 stores for this year.\n",
            "[00:22:25,100 --> 00:22:28,100]  That is very clear. Thank you very much.\n",
            "[00:22:28,100 --> 00:22:31,100]  Direct stores plus franchise stores.\n",
            "[00:22:31,100 --> 00:22:33,100]  Noted. Thank you.\n",
            "[00:22:33,100 --> 00:22:41,180]  Thank you. Our next question comes from Stephen Liu of Standard Chartered in Hong Kong. Please go ahead.\n",
            "[00:22:41,180 --> 00:22:43,180]  Okay. Thank you very much.\n",
            "[00:22:43,180 --> 00:22:44,180]  I have several questions.\n",
            "[00:22:44,180 --> 00:22:46,180]  One is regarding the capex.\n",
            "[00:22:46,180 --> 00:22:49,180]  I noticed a big increase in the fixed line capex.\n",
            "[00:22:49,180 --> 00:22:56,180]  Can you give me clarifying what kind of major spending for the increase in the fixed line capex?\n",
            "[00:22:56,180 --> 00:22:59,180]  Second question regarding the mobile business.\n",
            "[00:22:59,180 --> 00:23:04,180]  What kind of growth rate can we expect over the coming few years\n",
            "[00:23:04,180 --> 00:23:09,180]  and what kind of growth margin for the mobile business?\n",
            "[00:23:09,180 --> 00:23:14,180]  And my third question regarding the Apple, the mobile blended Apple.\n",
            "[00:23:14,180 --> 00:23:23,180]  Do you see a stable uptrend in the blended mobile Apple given that your smartphone penetration is increasing?\n",
            "[00:23:23,180 --> 00:23:27,180]  And maybe lastly about the mobile eBit margin.\n",
            "[00:23:27,180 --> 00:23:34,180]  Would you expect a stable, sustainable eBit margin expansion in the mobile business over the coming three years?\n",
            "[00:23:34,180 --> 00:23:37,180]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:23:37,180 --> 00:23:46,180]  Let me explain your first question on the capex of fixed line business.\n",
            "[00:23:46,180 --> 00:23:52,180]  It is related to the construction of the Internet data center.\n",
            "[00:23:52,180 --> 00:23:57,180]  The total construction cost is $2.8 billion.\n",
            "[00:23:57,180 --> 00:24:07,180]  The equipment procurement will be somewhere around $0.5 to $0.6 billion NT for 2012.\n",
            "[00:24:07,180 --> 00:24:17,180]  But out of this $2.8 billion construction cost, half a billion was included in last year's capex.\n",
            "[00:24:17,180 --> 00:24:26,180]  So this year you still see $2.3 billion in capex, in our total overall capex of $4 billion.\n",
            "[00:24:26,180 --> 00:24:44,300]  To strip out the IBC, the fixed line capex is maintained stable as compared to previous years.\n",
            "[00:24:44,300 --> 00:24:47,850]  Stephen, do you have any follow-up question?\n",
            "[00:24:47,850 --> 00:24:51,850]  Yes, second question regarding the mobile business.\n",
            "[00:24:51,850 --> 00:24:59,850]  What kind of growth rate and growth margin going forward for the mobile?\n",
            "[00:24:59,850 --> 00:25:00,850]  Do you mean the mobile shopping?\n",
            "[00:25:00,850 --> 00:25:04,330]  Yes.\n",
            "[00:25:04,330 --> 00:25:12,330]  Mobile expects to have an increase in revenue of about $4 billion this year,\n",
            "[00:25:12,330 --> 00:25:22,670]  mainly contributed by its home shopping and Internet business.\n",
            "[00:25:22,670 --> 00:25:31,670]  The growth will still come from the Internet business in terms of percentage growth rate.\n",
            "[00:25:32,670 --> 00:25:43,670]  Chinese investment in Beijing could be of more growth potential ahead.\n",
            "[00:25:43,670 --> 00:25:53,670]  But it just started operation in August last year, so it could take two to three years to turn around.\n",
            "[00:25:53,670 --> 00:26:00,670]  But before that, we still foresee some losses in that operation.\n",
            "[00:26:00,670 --> 00:26:11,660]  But I believe you all agree that China is a big market, so they do stand a chance of growing their business there.\n",
            "[00:26:11,660 --> 00:26:18,020]  So how about the mobile EBITDA margin trend, mobile business EBITDA margin?\n",
            "[00:26:18,020 --> 00:26:22,020]  Mobile EBITDA margin is facing some pressure.\n",
            "[00:26:23,020 --> 00:26:38,020]  For some time, the mobile voice revenue is facing severe pressure from mandatory tariff cuts and other regulatory interventions.\n",
            "[00:26:38,020 --> 00:26:48,020]  For last year alone, the regulatory interventions cost us $2.4 billion in revenue and $1.7 billion or $1.8 billion in EBITDA.\n",
            "[00:26:48,020 --> 00:27:02,820]  This year, apart from the ‚Äì well, actually, mandatory ‚Äì sorry, regulatory interventions actually increased,\n",
            "[00:27:02,820 --> 00:27:14,820]  not only including the mandatory tariff cuts, but also for the long-distance calls to be priced as local calls.\n",
            "[00:27:14,820 --> 00:27:29,850]  And also they have raised some calculations for us to pay more spectrum usage.\n",
            "[00:27:29,850 --> 00:27:32,850]  So that will cost us something.\n",
            "[00:27:32,850 --> 00:27:44,850]  And so in total, on the revenue front, the regulatory interventions will have about $8.6 billion impact on us.\n",
            "[00:27:44,850 --> 00:27:50,850]  And on EBITDA front, it will be $9.8 billion.\n",
            "[00:27:50,850 --> 00:27:55,850]  And net income will be affected by about $8 billion.\n",
            "[00:27:57,970 --> 00:28:03,970]  Okay, lastly, what's the current smartphone penetration?\n",
            "[00:28:03,970 --> 00:28:05,970]  21 percent.\n",
            "[00:28:05,970 --> 00:28:08,410]  Okay.\n",
            "[00:28:08,410 --> 00:28:09,410]  All right, thank you.\n",
            "[00:28:09,410 --> 00:28:13,100]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:28:13,100 --> 00:28:19,100]  Once again, ladies and gentlemen, if you'd like to register for a question, please press star 1 key on your telephone touchpad.\n",
            "[00:28:19,100 --> 00:28:20,100]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:28:20,100 --> 00:28:27,270]  Next, we have a follow-up question from Chad Andrew of Credit Suisse.\n",
            "[00:28:27,270 --> 00:28:29,270]  Please go ahead.\n",
            "[00:28:29,270 --> 00:28:30,270]  Thank you very much.\n",
            "[00:28:30,270 --> 00:28:35,270]  I just have one follow-up question on the regulatory side for FY12.\n",
            "[00:28:35,270 --> 00:28:41,270]  You mentioned briefly about the potential increase in spectrum usage fee.\n",
            "[00:28:41,270 --> 00:28:44,270]  Would you mind elaborate on that again?\n",
            "[00:28:44,270 --> 00:28:54,270]  And regarding the impact of $8.6 billion on the revenue side and $8 billion on the net profit, that is over what timeframe?\n",
            "[00:28:54,270 --> 00:28:56,270]  And how should we view that?\n",
            "[00:28:56,270 --> 00:28:57,270]  Thank you very much.\n",
            "[00:28:58,270 --> 00:29:05,270]  The total impact on the spectrum usage fee is $131 million MT.\n",
            "[00:29:05,270 --> 00:29:10,270]  That will not affect our revenue but will affect our spectrum.\n",
            "[00:29:10,270 --> 00:29:12,270]  I'm sorry, expense.\n",
            "[00:29:12,270 --> 00:29:14,270]  So it will affect our EBITDA.\n",
            "[00:29:14,270 --> 00:29:25,270]  But we will also have some savings on the concession fees.\n",
            "[00:29:26,270 --> 00:29:35,270]  So net net, the impact is about $120 million MT.\n",
            "[00:29:35,270 --> 00:29:47,220]  They changed the formula a bit to raise one factor from 0.5 to 0.85.\n",
            "[00:29:47,220 --> 00:29:51,220]  So NCC can charge us more, to put it simply.\n",
            "[00:29:51,220 --> 00:29:55,050]  Okay.\n",
            "[00:29:55,050 --> 00:29:56,050]  All right.\n",
            "[00:29:56,050 --> 00:30:03,050]  So can you go over the total regulatory impact for FY12 for me again, apart from the spectrum?\n",
            "[00:30:03,050 --> 00:30:05,050]  How much are you estimating?\n",
            "[00:30:05,050 --> 00:30:09,050]  You mean on the revenue or EBITDA?\n",
            "[00:30:09,050 --> 00:30:12,050]  On the revenue EBITDA and profit, if I may.\n",
            "[00:30:12,050 --> 00:30:13,050]  Yes.\n",
            "[00:30:13,050 --> 00:30:14,050]  Okay.\n",
            "[00:30:14,050 --> 00:30:15,050]  Let me repeat.\n",
            "[00:30:16,050 --> 00:30:26,050]  Regulatory interventions will have a total impact on our revenue for $862 million MT.\n",
            "[00:30:26,050 --> 00:30:35,230]  On the EBITDA front, our EBITDA will be affected by $978 million.\n",
            "[00:30:35,230 --> 00:30:43,030]  On the net income front, it will be affected by $812 million.\n",
            "[00:30:43,030 --> 00:30:44,030]  That is perfect.\n",
            "[00:30:44,030 --> 00:30:45,030]  Thank you very much.\n",
            "[00:30:45,030 --> 00:30:47,410]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:30:47,410 --> 00:30:50,410]  Our next question comes from Lucy Liu of JPMorgan Hong Kong.\n",
            "[00:30:50,410 --> 00:30:51,410]  Please go ahead.\n",
            "[00:30:52,410 --> 00:30:53,410]  Hi.\n",
            "[00:30:53,410 --> 00:30:55,410]  Thank you very much for the presentation.\n",
            "[00:30:55,410 --> 00:30:57,410]  I have three questions.\n",
            "[00:30:57,410 --> 00:31:03,410]  So the first one is due on some of your motions that you actually are doing now this year.\n",
            "[00:31:03,410 --> 00:31:09,410]  For example, the free on-net call plus like a post-pay data plan.\n",
            "[00:31:09,410 --> 00:31:16,410]  So just wondering if such a promotion will be carried on in a year or if there is any\n",
            "[00:31:16,410 --> 00:31:21,410]  strategy change for penetration in this market.\n",
            "[00:31:21,410 --> 00:31:24,410]  And the second delay is on MOMO still.\n",
            "[00:31:24,410 --> 00:31:26,410]  So actually I did a rough speculation.\n",
            "[00:31:26,410 --> 00:31:31,410]  It seems like your new guidance actually implies even adjusted for the full year,\n",
            "[00:31:31,410 --> 00:31:36,410]  like you only included slightly less than six months last year,\n",
            "[00:31:36,410 --> 00:31:38,410]  but will include a full year impact this year.\n",
            "[00:31:38,410 --> 00:31:41,410]  But even adjusted for this factor,\n",
            "[00:31:41,410 --> 00:31:47,410]  it seems like you are suggesting MOMO revenue will grow by like a 30% year on year.\n",
            "[00:31:47,410 --> 00:31:49,410]  So just a wonder, you know,\n",
            "[00:31:49,410 --> 00:31:53,410]  what is changing a MOMO business alone and why you are projecting such a high growth.\n",
            "[00:31:53,410 --> 00:31:59,410]  And lastly is on the dividend or capital management side.\n",
            "[00:31:59,410 --> 00:32:03,410]  So just a wonder, are we saying that, you know,\n",
            "[00:32:03,410 --> 00:32:09,410]  basically the whole thing is depending on our capital acquisition potential in future\n",
            "[00:32:09,410 --> 00:32:12,410]  or any kind of change on that front.\n",
            "[00:32:12,410 --> 00:32:18,750]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:32:18,750 --> 00:32:21,750]  Could you please repeat your first question?\n",
            "[00:32:21,750 --> 00:32:23,040]  Okay.\n",
            "[00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:26,040]  So first question is in the new year,\n",
            "[00:32:26,040 --> 00:32:31,040]  in terms of penetration, it depends on the smartphone market.\n",
            "[00:32:31,040 --> 00:32:37,040]  So whether there is any strategy change or whether there is any promotion change,\n",
            "[00:32:37,040 --> 00:32:43,040]  such as you launched the free online call plus like a postpaid data plan last year.\n",
            "[00:32:43,040 --> 00:32:48,040]  I understand that previously said this plan will be stopped by the end of last year.\n",
            "[00:32:48,040 --> 00:32:50,040]  So just a wonder whether, you know,\n",
            "[00:32:50,040 --> 00:32:57,290]  it will be still carried on or any new promotions will be launched in this year.\n",
            "[00:32:57,290 --> 00:33:02,290]  Regarding to the first one is that in order to help the penetration of smartphone,\n",
            "[00:33:03,290 --> 00:33:10,290]  this year's strategy is really to increase the penetration of smartphone in the middle end and low end customers.\n",
            "[00:33:10,290 --> 00:33:13,290]  So the execution is the same.\n",
            "[00:33:13,290 --> 00:33:16,290]  So the strategy is no different from the last year.\n",
            "[00:33:16,290 --> 00:33:18,290]  As far as for the promotion,\n",
            "[00:33:18,290 --> 00:33:25,290]  we are currently evaluating whether we should continue or stop the online free call program.\n",
            "[00:33:25,290 --> 00:33:31,290]  And it really, we wouldn't come to a decision maybe after the Chinese New Year.\n",
            "[00:33:31,290 --> 00:33:36,290]  So by March timeframe or by the end of first quarter,\n",
            "[00:33:36,290 --> 00:33:45,290]  we can give you more information regarding whether some of the promotion will continue or stop.\n",
            "[00:33:45,290 --> 00:33:51,290]  As for Momo, Rosie will answer the Momo question.\n",
            "[00:33:51,290 --> 00:34:00,510]  Momo's growth on the revenue front will come largely from its TV shopping.\n",
            "[00:34:00,510 --> 00:34:01,510]  As you know that last year,\n",
            "[00:34:01,510 --> 00:34:10,510]  their TV shopping business was hard hit by the dietary supplements advertisement issues\n",
            "[00:34:10,510 --> 00:34:17,510]  and plasticizer content issue in the food.\n",
            "[00:34:17,510 --> 00:34:22,510]  So there were a lot of challenges last year.\n",
            "[00:34:22,510 --> 00:34:30,510]  So for 2012, they expect these businesses to be back on track.\n",
            "[00:34:30,510 --> 00:34:47,860]  That's why they forecast to have about $4 billion increase in revenue for this year.\n",
            "[00:34:47,860 --> 00:35:08,340]  And on your question of dividends,\n",
            "[00:35:08,340 --> 00:35:13,340]  on your third question of our dividend policy,\n",
            "[00:35:13,340 --> 00:35:21,340]  we don't think the acquisition of KBRO will have any impact on our dividend policy.\n",
            "[00:35:21,340 --> 00:35:26,340]  First of all, we still have ample debt capacity.\n",
            "[00:35:26,340 --> 00:35:38,340]  Secondly, even if the cable law is revised,\n",
            "[00:35:38,340 --> 00:35:46,340]  we would consider various options to pay the consideration.\n",
            "[00:35:46,340 --> 00:35:53,340]  So while we don't rule out the possibilities of swapping shares with them,\n",
            "[00:35:53,340 --> 00:35:58,340]  as long as it's EPS accretive, as we mentioned three years ago.\n",
            "[00:35:58,340 --> 00:36:05,340]  And cable business actually is highly cash generative.\n",
            "[00:36:05,340 --> 00:36:12,650]  So we don't think it will affect our dividend policy.\n",
            "[00:36:12,650 --> 00:36:19,650]  Are you talking about normal dividend policy or the special dividend or capital management policy?\n",
            "[00:36:19,650 --> 00:36:29,650]  No, I was answering your question of dividend policy you raised.\n",
            "[00:36:29,650 --> 00:36:31,650]  Sorry. So let me clarify.\n",
            "[00:36:31,650 --> 00:36:37,650]  Because previously I was referring to your special dividend or any capital management potential.\n",
            "[00:36:37,650 --> 00:36:40,650]  I'm not referring to the normal policy.\n",
            "[00:36:40,650 --> 00:36:45,450]  Okay.\n",
            "[00:36:45,450 --> 00:36:55,450]  Basically, as I mentioned the numbers earlier,\n",
            "[00:36:55,450 --> 00:37:03,450]  I just want to let you know that there is more flexibility for us to distribute dividends.\n",
            "[00:37:03,450 --> 00:37:12,850]  But whether we will do capital management this year or not, it's up to the board to decide.\n",
            "[00:37:12,850 --> 00:37:16,620]  Okay.\n",
            "[00:37:16,620 --> 00:37:21,620]  And did you ask about the status of cable acquisition?\n",
            "[00:37:21,620 --> 00:37:22,970]  No.\n",
            "[00:37:22,970 --> 00:37:23,970]  No, no, no, no.\n",
            "[00:37:23,970 --> 00:37:26,380]  Okay.\n",
            "[00:37:26,380 --> 00:37:29,380]  Sorry, can I actually have a follow-up question?\n",
            "[00:37:29,380 --> 00:37:33,380]  So I'm looking at your margin guidance for 2012.\n",
            "[00:37:33,380 --> 00:37:40,380]  So it's actually 28%, so declining by like a five percentage point versus this year.\n",
            "[00:37:41,380 --> 00:37:47,380]  So I understand, you know, higher like equipment, smartphone equipment, sales revenue,\n",
            "[00:37:47,380 --> 00:37:50,380]  or maybe some impact from iPhone.\n",
            "[00:37:50,380 --> 00:37:56,380]  But if I look at your December margin, actually, which is 21%,\n",
            "[00:37:56,380 --> 00:38:00,380]  I think it's already started to get impacted by iPhone.\n",
            "[00:38:00,380 --> 00:38:04,420]  So just take that number at the base.\n",
            "[00:38:04,420 --> 00:38:10,420]  It seems like you are assuming the margin for the full year will only slightly improve\n",
            "[00:38:10,420 --> 00:38:12,420]  from very low base in December.\n",
            "[00:38:12,420 --> 00:38:15,420]  Is that their assumption?\n",
            "[00:38:15,420 --> 00:38:30,590]  Is that mostly because of iPhone or because of some other smartphone devices that are also going to launch?\n",
            "[00:38:30,590 --> 00:38:39,590]  Well, I think the margin erosion that you see this year is due largely to higher revenue mix from MOMO\n",
            "[00:38:39,590 --> 00:38:44,590]  because MOMO's EBITDA margin is only single digits.\n",
            "[00:38:44,590 --> 00:38:46,970]  Okay.\n",
            "[00:38:46,970 --> 00:38:54,270]  I understand.\n",
            "[00:38:54,270 --> 00:38:55,270]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:38:55,270 --> 00:38:58,270]  Once again, ladies and gentlemen, if you'd like to register for a question,\n",
            "[00:38:58,270 --> 00:39:01,270]  please press star 1 key on your telephone touchpad.\n",
            "[00:39:01,270 --> 00:39:04,610]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:39:04,610 --> 00:39:08,610]  Our next question comes from Joyce Hsiao of Barclays in Hong Kong.\n",
            "[00:39:08,610 --> 00:39:10,610]  Please go ahead.\n",
            "[00:39:10,610 --> 00:39:11,610]  Hello.\n",
            "[00:39:11,610 --> 00:39:13,610]  I want to ask one question.\n",
            "[00:39:13,610 --> 00:39:19,610]  So in your revenue forecast for 2012 of $102 billion,\n",
            "[00:39:19,610 --> 00:39:26,610]  I want to know how much of the revenue you are focusing coming from the device sales part.\n",
            "[00:39:26,610 --> 00:39:37,610]  And also a second question is on your EBITDA, the full year 2012 guidance 28%,\n",
            "[00:39:37,610 --> 00:39:42,610]  what is your EBITDA assumption for MOMO business standalone?\n",
            "[00:39:42,610 --> 00:39:58,700]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:39:58,700 --> 00:40:26,840]  About $10 billion in device sales for this year.\n",
            "[00:40:26,840 --> 00:40:30,840]  MOMO's EBITDA margin is about 7%.\n",
            "[00:40:30,840 --> 00:40:35,460]  Okay.\n",
            "[00:40:35,460 --> 00:40:40,460]  So if MOMO's EBITDA margin is 7%,\n",
            "[00:40:41,460 --> 00:40:43,460]  if my calculation is right,\n",
            "[00:40:43,460 --> 00:40:51,460]  then you should assume like other business division to see EBITDA margin decline for 2012.\n",
            "[00:40:51,460 --> 00:41:53,880]  Is it mobile or is it which business division do you expect a margin decline?\n",
            "[00:41:53,880 --> 00:42:00,880]  Our consumer business group EBITDA margin will see very minor decrease this year.\n",
            "[00:42:00,880 --> 00:42:07,880]  As I said, the overall EBITDA margin decline is due to higher revenue contribution from MOMO.\n",
            "[00:42:07,880 --> 00:42:08,880]  Okay.\n",
            "[00:42:08,880 --> 00:42:09,880]  Thank you very much.\n",
            "[00:42:09,880 --> 00:42:15,880]  And a final question on the regulatory thing.\n",
            "[00:42:15,880 --> 00:42:23,880]  I think previously you mentioned there is some regulation on the holding of the cable and media business.\n",
            "[00:42:23,880 --> 00:42:26,880]  So is there any update on that side?\n",
            "[00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:30,790]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:42:30,790 --> 00:42:39,950]  No update can be shared at this moment because the legislative grant,\n",
            "[00:42:39,950 --> 00:42:44,950]  well, we just finished our election of the legislators as you know.\n",
            "[00:42:44,950 --> 00:42:53,950]  So the legislative grant will not start their session until probably March this year only.\n",
            "[00:42:53,950 --> 00:42:56,260]  Okay.\n",
            "[00:42:56,260 --> 00:42:58,870]  Thank you very much.\n",
            "[00:42:58,870 --> 00:42:59,870]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:42:59,870 --> 00:43:02,870]  The next question comes from Mr. Bancho of Credit Suisse.\n",
            "[00:43:02,870 --> 00:43:04,870]  Please go ahead.\n",
            "[00:43:04,870 --> 00:43:05,870]  I am sorry.\n",
            "[00:43:05,870 --> 00:43:09,870]  Just one additional question from myself regarding the total dividend potential.\n",
            "[00:43:09,870 --> 00:43:11,870]  I understand that it is up to the board,\n",
            "[00:43:11,870 --> 00:43:23,870]  but just in theory how much would you be able to distribute in terms of the special dividend like theoretical maximum?\n",
            "[00:43:24,870 --> 00:43:31,870]  And the second question is regarding any long-term gearing level that you would want to achieve\n",
            "[00:43:31,870 --> 00:43:32,870]  or you would be comfortable with.\n",
            "[00:43:32,870 --> 00:43:37,180]  Thank you very much.\n",
            "[00:43:37,180 --> 00:43:47,180]  The maximum capacity that we can top up our dividend is the number that I mentioned to you,\n",
            "[00:43:47,180 --> 00:43:55,180]  which totals $23.6 billion, of which $12.4 billion comes from capital surplus,\n",
            "[00:43:55,180 --> 00:44:01,180]  $8.2 billion from legal reserve, and $3 billion from retained earnings.\n",
            "[00:44:02,180 --> 00:44:17,410]  This is the extra room that we can top up our dividend on top of our current year earnings.\n",
            "[00:44:17,410 --> 00:44:18,410]  Okay.\n",
            "[00:44:18,410 --> 00:44:21,410]  So that is the maximum.\n",
            "[00:44:21,410 --> 00:44:29,100]  Any longer-term gearing level that you would like to achieve or you would be comfortable with?\n",
            "[00:44:30,100 --> 00:44:41,100]  We are comfortable with our gearing levels as long as the spending could enhance shareholder return.\n",
            "[00:44:41,100 --> 00:44:43,290]  Perfect.\n",
            "[00:44:43,290 --> 00:44:48,390]  Thank you very much.\n",
            "[00:44:48,390 --> 00:44:49,390]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:44:49,390 --> 00:44:52,390]  Once again, ladies and gentlemen, if you would like to register for a question,\n",
            "[00:44:52,390 --> 00:44:54,390]  please press star 1 key on your telephone touchpad.\n",
            "[00:44:54,390 --> 00:45:02,760]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:45:02,760 --> 00:45:09,180]  Our next question comes from Parish Mugai of Goldman Sachs in Hong Kong.\n",
            "[00:45:09,180 --> 00:45:11,180]  Good afternoon, and thank you for the call.\n",
            "[00:45:11,180 --> 00:45:16,180]  I've got a very simple question, but if you could help me understand it, I'd be very appreciative.\n",
            "[00:45:16,180 --> 00:45:22,180]  I want to understand how you determine the level of equipment growth that you want to see in a year.\n",
            "[00:45:22,180 --> 00:45:27,180]  You're going to see a big number in 2012, but when we look ahead,\n",
            "[00:45:27,180 --> 00:45:33,180]  could we expect, for example, in 2013 there will be a slowdown in equipment growth\n",
            "[00:45:33,180 --> 00:45:39,180]  and there will be a commensurate improvement of 500 basis points or so in your EBITDA margin?\n",
            "[00:45:39,180 --> 00:45:41,180]  Could you comment on that, please?\n",
            "[00:45:41,180 --> 00:45:49,060]  Well, it's very hard to say at the moment because, as you know,\n",
            "[00:45:49,060 --> 00:45:55,060]  it's very hard to predict what will happen in 2013 because there is so much uncertainty.\n",
            "[00:45:55,060 --> 00:46:02,060]  But the reason we have great equipment sales is that starting last year,\n",
            "[00:46:02,060 --> 00:46:08,060]  we have increased the sales of handsets unbundled in our shops.\n",
            "[00:46:08,060 --> 00:46:15,060]  That's why this year you see a tremendous growth in equipment sales revenue this year.\n",
            "[00:46:15,060 --> 00:46:22,060]  I would foresee in 2013 we still would see handset sales increase,\n",
            "[00:46:22,060 --> 00:46:27,060]  but the growth rate wouldn't be as high as this year.\n",
            "[00:46:28,060 --> 00:46:34,990]  Okay, so it will be less than the $10 billion you're provisioning for 2012.\n",
            "[00:46:34,990 --> 00:46:40,990]  Could you then remind us what the margin is for the flow-through handset sales that you are doing?\n",
            "[00:46:40,990 --> 00:46:44,990]  Well, it really depends.\n",
            "[00:46:44,990 --> 00:46:51,990]  I think we are still trying to increase our margin.\n",
            "[00:46:52,990 --> 00:46:59,210]  At this moment, I'm not at the liberty to disclose our margin.\n",
            "[00:46:59,210 --> 00:47:01,210]  Okay, and my last question.\n",
            "[00:47:01,210 --> 00:47:04,210]  When we think of each customer who is coming on board as a smartphone customer,\n",
            "[00:47:04,210 --> 00:47:08,210]  who do you think the average longevity is likely to be?\n",
            "[00:47:08,210 --> 00:47:11,210]  Are they coming on from your existing customer base\n",
            "[00:47:11,210 --> 00:47:14,210]  or are you importing them from one of your competitors?\n",
            "[00:47:14,210 --> 00:47:22,210]  Well, right now I think more than 50% of the new smartphone users\n",
            "[00:47:22,210 --> 00:47:28,500]  are from our existing customer base, over 50%.\n",
            "[00:47:28,500 --> 00:47:36,500]  And the rest is really from the new subscribers from other mobile operators or from new subscribers.\n",
            "[00:47:36,500 --> 00:47:38,500]  Okay, and my last question.\n",
            "[00:47:38,500 --> 00:47:42,500]  Where are you now on LTE and LTE launch?\n",
            "[00:47:42,500 --> 00:47:47,040]  Oh, we are still a long way from LTE launch.\n",
            "[00:47:47,040 --> 00:47:51,040]  Based on the recent government information,\n",
            "[00:47:51,040 --> 00:48:01,040]  NCC was originally not going to auction the LTE frequency until 2015.\n",
            "[00:48:01,040 --> 00:48:12,040]  But there was a strong push from industry and the media to push for earlier releasing our LTE license.\n",
            "[00:48:13,040 --> 00:48:21,040]  Now we feel that it's possible the government will auction the LTE license in 2014.\n",
            "[00:48:21,040 --> 00:48:26,040]  But the exact date is still not finalized.\n",
            "[00:48:26,040 --> 00:48:33,040]  We can only imagine that a new license will be auctioned in 2014.\n",
            "[00:48:33,040 --> 00:48:37,960]  Okay, thank you very much.\n",
            "[00:48:37,960 --> 00:48:38,960]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:48:38,960 --> 00:48:41,960]  Once again, ladies and gentlemen, if you'd like to register for a question,\n",
            "[00:48:41,960 --> 00:48:44,960]  please press star 1 key now. Thank you.\n",
            "[00:48:44,960 --> 00:48:55,520]  Once again, ladies and gentlemen, if you'd like to register for a question,\n",
            "[00:48:55,520 --> 00:48:59,520]  please press star 1 key on your telephone touchpad. Thank you.\n",
            "[00:48:59,520 --> 00:49:11,290]  Excuse me, Mr. Lai, we have a follow-up question from Mr. Stephen Liu of Standard Chartered in Hong Kong.\n",
            "[00:49:11,290 --> 00:49:12,290]  Please go ahead.\n",
            "[00:49:12,290 --> 00:49:14,290]  Okay, thank you very much.\n",
            "[00:49:14,290 --> 00:49:19,290]  Just a follow-up question on the smartphone strategy.\n",
            "[00:49:19,290 --> 00:49:23,290]  We know in China a lot of low-priced smartphones are very popular\n",
            "[00:49:23,290 --> 00:49:27,290]  and get a lot of attraction by the mass market users.\n",
            "[00:49:27,290 --> 00:49:29,290]  How about you in Taiwan?\n",
            "[00:49:29,290 --> 00:49:35,290]  Do you see the demand for the mid-range priced smartphone sales in Taiwan?\n",
            "[00:49:35,290 --> 00:49:44,290]  What's your strategy in the future to introduce mid-range smartphones like HTC and Huawei ZTE?\n",
            "[00:49:44,290 --> 00:49:48,290]  What's your strategy in this area?\n",
            "[00:49:49,290 --> 00:49:56,290]  Well, this year we intend to introduce more mid-range and low-range smartphone models.\n",
            "[00:49:56,290 --> 00:50:04,290]  In our budget, we have increased quite substantially the number of subscribers\n",
            "[00:50:04,290 --> 00:50:08,290]  using low-end and middle-end smartphones.\n",
            "[00:50:08,290 --> 00:50:16,290]  So this is the reason why we can see further smartphone penetration increase.\n",
            "[00:50:17,290 --> 00:50:22,290]  So that's the trend and the strategy we are going to use for this year.\n",
            "[00:50:22,290 --> 00:50:30,290]  So, you know, currently your smartphone user, Apple, is more than double the smartphone user.\n",
            "[00:50:30,290 --> 00:50:36,290]  Would you see an impact when you introduce mid-range smartphones?\n",
            "[00:50:36,290 --> 00:50:39,290]  Should we lower Apple, do you think?\n",
            "[00:50:39,290 --> 00:50:42,290]  Well, I think so because the subsidy level is lower.\n",
            "[00:50:42,290 --> 00:50:45,290]  So, of course, the Apple level is lower.\n",
            "[00:50:45,290 --> 00:50:54,290]  But I do think that when they adopt a smartphone, the overall Apple will increase.\n",
            "[00:50:54,290 --> 00:51:00,290]  Therefore, I still am quite optimistic about our Apple for this year.\n",
            "[00:51:00,290 --> 00:51:03,290]  Total Apple, average Apple.\n",
            "[00:51:04,290 --> 00:51:15,620]  So basically, do you think the net Apple, I mean the net hands-on Apple for smartphone users\n",

            "[00:51:19,620 --> 00:51:29,550]  Smartphone users' Apple in general are higher than non-smartphone users' Apple.\n",
            "[00:51:29,550 --> 00:51:35,710]  That's right, because you have a voice tariff plus a data tariff.\n",
            "[00:51:35,710 --> 00:51:42,710]  How about after excluding the handset subsidy, the net Apple?\n",
            "[00:51:42,710 --> 00:51:45,640]  I beg your pardon?\n",
            "[00:51:45,640 --> 00:51:50,640]  I mean the net Apple after deducting the handset subsidy.\n",
            "[00:51:50,640 --> 00:51:53,470]  After deducting the handset subsidy?\n",
            "[00:51:53,470 --> 00:51:54,950]  Yes.\n",
            "[00:51:54,950 --> 00:51:58,950]  We don't calculate like this way.\n",
            "[00:51:58,950 --> 00:52:08,460]  After the handset subsidy, the smartphone users' profit contribution is still higher than the future phone users.\n",
            "[00:52:09,460 --> 00:52:13,460]  And the subsidies are expensed upfront.\n",
            "[00:52:13,460 --> 00:52:16,460]  Okay. Thank you.\n",
            "[00:52:17,460 --> 00:52:25,900]  Thank you. Next, we have a question from Mr. Poovish Mubai of Goldman Sachs in Hong Kong. Thank you.\n",
            "[00:52:26,900 --> 00:52:30,900]  Thank you. Sorry, this is a late thought, but I want to check with you.\n",
            "[00:52:30,900 --> 00:52:34,900]  Your roaming exposure is both on a net and a gross basis, please.\n",
            "[00:52:34,900 --> 00:52:37,900]  And if you're seeing any weakness at all on that front. Thank you.\n",
            "[00:52:38,900 --> 00:52:51,300]  Could you please repeat your question?\n",
            "[00:52:51,300 --> 00:52:55,300]  Yes. Could you tell us what your net roaming exposure is?\n",
            "[00:52:56,300 --> 00:52:59,300]  Only 2 to 3 percent.\n",
            "[00:52:59,300 --> 00:53:01,300]  Okay. That's good news. Thank you very much.\n",

            "[00:01:14,610 --> 00:01:19,610]  In the next three slides, I would like to highlight our growth areas.\n",
            "[00:01:19,610 --> 00:01:26,610]  First, our wireless data. In the third quarter, despite regulatory interventions,\n",
            "[00:01:26,610 --> 00:01:30,610]  which dragged down our voice revenue by 600 million,\n",

            "[00:02:02,570 --> 00:02:08,370]  we currently have around 30 smartphone and tablet models on the market.\n",
            "[00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:14,400]  Smartphone users are to remain at more than two times that of post-paid,\n",
            "[00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:17,400]  while their payback periods are very similar.\n",
            "[00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:24,400]  In third quarter 11, smartphone sales volume was up 46% from a year ago\n",

            "[00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:15,580]  thanks to some revenue growth that more than offset the increase in both handset subsidy and new store expenses,\n",
            "[00:04:15,580 --> 00:04:21,580]  EBITDA growth in third quarter was pronounced 11% worldwide.\n",
            "[00:04:21,580 --> 00:04:28,810]  Momo's contribution this quarter has provided additional growth to the company.\n",
            "[00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:35,840]  We mitigated the negative impact from the impairment losses of Taiwan High Speed Rail\n",
            "[00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:46,870]  by a strong core business performance and an overview of crude corporate tax expenses reversal in third quarter.\n",
            "[00:04:46,870 --> 00:04:55,900]  Additionally, 10% capital reduction in August helped boost up our third quarter EPS.\n",
            "[00:04:57,190 --> 00:05:05,190]  For the first three quarters, our investment in smartphones paid off with mobile data revenue\n",
            "[00:05:05,190 --> 00:05:09,190]  coming in higher than the increased handset subsidies.\n",
            "[00:05:09,190 --> 00:05:17,220]  Separately, we halved the negative impact of the regulatory interventions on profits\n",
            "[00:05:17,220 --> 00:05:25,220]  through cost savings and more profit contributions from the cable TV business and Momo.\n",
            "[00:05:25,220 --> 00:05:34,320]  In a nutshell, accumulated EBITDA reached 79% of our four-year target.\n",

            "[00:05:56,250 --> 00:06:04,250]  EBITDAs of CBG and EBG were both up quarter by quarter and year over year.\n",
            "[00:06:04,250 --> 00:06:11,660]  Benefiting from a higher blended output as a result of a rising subscriber base\n",
            "[00:06:11,660 --> 00:06:15,660]  in both cable internet and DTV,\n",
            "[00:06:15,660 --> 00:06:21,660]  HBG's third quarter profit maintained a stable double-digit YOY growth.\n",
            "[00:06:21,660 --> 00:06:29,760]  Momo contributed to 3% of PWM's consolidated EBITDA in third quarter,\n",
            "[00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:36,760]  negatively affected by shifting from high-margin dietary supplementary\n",
            "[00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:40,760]  into higher turnover low-margin customer electronics.\n",
            "[00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:45,760]  As well as high start-up cost of its China operations,\n",
            "[00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:50,920]  Momo's EBITDA failed to post a YOY growth in the quarter.\n",
            "[00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:56,920]  Let me turn this presentation to Rosie for balance sheet and cash flow analysis.\n",
            "[00:06:56,920 --> 00:07:00,720]  Now let's look at the balance sheet.\n",
            "[00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:07,720]  Cash balance decreased sequentially mainly due to cash outlays for the Momo acquisition.\n",
            "[00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:13,720]  The decrease in long-term investment is because of the 1.21 billion write-offs\n",
            "[00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:16,720]  on Taiwan High-Speed Railway investment.\n",
            "[00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:25,300]  And the increase in intangible assets was a reflection of the purchase of Momo\n",
            "[00:07:25,300 --> 00:07:32,300]  with the purchase price higher than its net worth by 7.2 billion NT.\n",
            "[00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:39,300]  Net debt netted 14.6 billion or 54% annual EBITDA\n",
            "[00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:46,330]  following a 13.27 billion increase in short-term debt in the third quarter.\n",
            "[00:07:46,330 --> 00:07:53,330]  Paving capital decreased to 34.2 billion following the 10% capital reduction\n",
            "[00:07:53,330 --> 00:08:00,490]  or 1 NT dollar per share effective from August 1st.\n",
            "[00:08:00,490 --> 00:08:08,490]  Carrying value of treasury shares also was reduced by 812 million accordingly.\n",
            "[00:08:08,490 --> 00:08:13,990]  Now let's turn to cash flow analysis.\n",
            "[00:08:13,990 --> 00:08:21,020]  The third quarter operating cash inflow remained at a comparable level to a quarter ago.\n",
            "[00:08:21,020 --> 00:08:25,020]  On the investing activity front,\n",
            "[00:08:25,020 --> 00:08:33,020]  the 8.35 billion investment for the acquisition of the 51% stake in Momo\n",
            "[00:08:33,020 --> 00:08:39,020]  and the Internet Data Center contract payments made in the third quarter\n",
            "[00:08:39,020 --> 00:08:42,020]  increased investment cash outflows.\n",
            "[00:08:42,020 --> 00:08:46,500]  In terms of financing activities,\n",
            "[00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:49,500]  we increased short-term borrowing in the third quarter\n",
            "[00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:53,500]  to fund the Momo acquisition and cash dividend payments.\n",
            "[00:08:54,860 --> 00:09:00,860]  Cumulative free cash flow reached 12.46 billion,\n",
            "[00:09:00,860 --> 00:09:05,860]  translating into an analyzed yield of 5.8%.\n",
            "[00:09:05,860 --> 00:09:12,270]  Now let me turn this back to Vivian for event update and key message.\n",
            "[00:09:12,270 --> 00:09:19,530]  Please turn to the event update.\n",
            "[00:09:19,530 --> 00:09:26,530]  This slide which stated the regulatory update and the awards we received for the quarter\n",

            "[00:09:32,010 --> 00:09:35,010]  To wrap up our presentation,\n",
            "[00:09:35,010 --> 00:09:40,010]  this slide summarizes the key messages that we would like to deliver,\n",
            "[00:09:40,010 --> 00:09:48,390]  which means strong smartphone sales have laid a solid foundation for revenue growth.\n",
            "[00:09:48,390 --> 00:09:54,390]  Increasing subsidies are expected to be offset by a rise in revenue,\n",
            "[00:09:54,390 --> 00:09:58,390]  hence making a positive contribution to EBITDA.\n",
            "[00:09:58,390 --> 00:10:02,390]  However, the timing of the iPhone 4S launch\n",
            "[00:10:02,390 --> 00:10:09,390]  would still have a final defining impact on fourth quarter results.\n",
            "[00:10:09,390 --> 00:10:15,740]  That's all our presentation and we hand over the floor to Q&A.\n",

            "[00:10:17,350 --> 00:10:19,350]  Ladies and gentlemen, we will now open for questions.\n",
            "[00:10:19,350 --> 00:10:21,350]  If you would like to register for a question,\n",
            "[00:10:21,350 --> 00:10:24,350]  please press star 1 key on your telephone touchpad.\n",
            "[00:10:24,350 --> 00:10:29,010]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:10:29,010 --> 00:10:32,010]  Our first question comes from Danny Chee of Nomura Hong Kong.\n",
            "[00:10:32,010 --> 00:10:34,010]  Please go ahead.\n",
            "[00:10:34,010 --> 00:10:36,010]  Hi. Thank you for the presentation.\n",
            "[00:10:36,010 --> 00:10:39,010]  I have three quick questions.\n",
            "[00:10:39,010 --> 00:10:42,010]  First is in the management report,\n",
            "[00:10:42,010 --> 00:10:47,010]  you mentioned that the timing of the iPhone 4S launch\n",
            "[00:10:47,010 --> 00:10:52,010]  might have a defining impact on fourth quarter results.\n",
            "[00:10:52,010 --> 00:10:56,010]  Although I understand it is difficult to quantify\n",
            "[00:10:56,010 --> 00:10:59,010]  how much that impact could be,\n",
            "[00:10:59,010 --> 00:11:03,040]  but looking at last time when iPhone 4 launched,\n",
            "[00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:08,040]  if we have to put it in terms of a quantifiable number,\n",
            "[00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:12,040]  how much impact are we talking about potentially on EBITDA margin\n",
            "[00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:16,040]  or in EBITDA by itself for fourth quarter this year?\n",
            "[00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:18,040]  That's my first question.\n",
            "[00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:22,040]  Second question is with regards to the record trade update.\n",
            "[00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:27,040]  So if the announcement from the NCC\n",
            "[00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:30,040]  is made in the first quarter next year,\n",
            "[00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:34,040]  what kind of implications we should make from that proposal\n",
            "[00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:37,040]  getting approved in first quarter next year?\n",
            "[00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:43,040]  And the final question is just after the recent capital reduction,\n",
            "[00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:45,040]  I just want to double check\n",
            "[00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:49,040]  what is the number of treasury shares right now\n",
            "[00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:51,040]  and including the treasury shares,\n",
            "[00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:55,040]  how many shares total outstanding of the company?\n",
            "[00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:56,040]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:11:56,040 --> 00:12:01,350]  As for the first question, the timing of iPhone 4S,\n",
            "[00:12:01,350 --> 00:12:08,350]  as you know, Apple is very secretive about the timing of the iPhone 4S.\n",
            "[00:12:08,350 --> 00:12:14,350]  So there is no way we have an idea regarding when this will be launched,\n",
            "[00:12:14,350 --> 00:12:19,350]  whether it's early November or late November or early December.\n",
            "[00:12:19,350 --> 00:12:21,380]  This is the first issue.\n",
            "[00:12:21,380 --> 00:12:29,540]  So second issue is that it also depends on the kind of volume Apple can ship to us\n",
            "[00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:33,540]  because even though we have a similar experience last year,\n",
            "[00:12:33,540 --> 00:12:42,600]  but in last year, when we launched the product,\n",
            "[00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:44,600]  Apple didn't ship enough products.\n",
            "[00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:51,600]  So the sales volume was constrained by the volume Apple shipped.\n",
            "[00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:58,600]  But this time, as you know, iPhone 4S is now a totally new model.\n",
            "[00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:01,600]  So whether Apple can ship more products,\n",
            "[00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:08,760]  the volume will also determine the subsidy we have to put in.\n",
            "[00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:13,760]  So the straight answer is that at this moment,\n",
            "[00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:21,300]  I cannot give you a definite answer regarding the financial impact.\n",
            "[00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:32,830]  As for the implication of if NCC approved to have new license on new cable area,\n",
            "[00:13:32,830 --> 00:13:39,830]  even though if it gets approved, assuming it is approved in first quarter,\n",
            "[00:13:39,830 --> 00:13:43,830]  it wouldn't have any financial impact in the short term,\n",
            "[00:13:43,830 --> 00:13:49,310]  for instance, for the second quarter, I presume,\n",
            "[00:13:49,310 --> 00:13:57,310]  because anyone who gets a license and needs to do implementation\n",
            "[00:13:57,310 --> 00:13:59,310]  in order to provide the service,\n",
            "[00:13:59,310 --> 00:14:03,600]  and the implementation time would take several quarters\n",
            "[00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:06,600]  in order for them to be ready to offer the service.\n",
            "[00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:09,600]  So at the moment, short term-wise,\n",
            "[00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:16,210]  I don't see there's any impact to our operation or performance.\n",
            "[00:14:16,210 --> 00:14:19,210]  As for the treasury issue, Rose?\n",
            "[00:14:19,210 --> 00:14:25,240]  Treasury shares outstanding now are $730 million.\n",
            "[00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:36,510]  So the total share count after deduction of the treasury shares will be $2.689 million here.\n",
            "[00:14:36,510 --> 00:14:38,510]  Thank you for that.\n",
            "[00:14:38,510 --> 00:14:43,120]  If I may just ask one follow-up question.\n",
            "[00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:46,120]  Given management indicates there is no conflict,\n",
            "[00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:49,120]  it's very difficult to quantify what is the impact\n",
            "[00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:54,120]  or how much we are talking about the iPhone 4S launch might have on the 4Q results.\n",
            "[00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:59,120]  So should we still assume at this moment the company is still on track\n",
            "[00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:04,120]  to achieve its EBITDA and earnings full year guidance?\n",
            "[00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:06,220]  Yes.\n",
            "[00:15:06,220 --> 00:15:10,500]  Let me also share.\n",
            "[00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:11,500]  Let me also.\n",
            "[00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:12,500]  We asked you, Nick.\n",
            "[00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:18,500]  Up to now, we haven't received a price quote of iPhone 4S from Apple.\n",
            "[00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:21,500]  So there's another factor.\n",
            "[00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:23,500]  But even with the iPhone,\n",
            "[00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:30,500]  it wouldn't affect our commitment to achieve our EBITDA target for this year.\n",
            "[00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:35,380]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:15:35,380 --> 00:15:36,380]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:15:36,380 --> 00:15:37,380]  Once again, ladies and gentlemen,\n",
            "[00:15:37,380 --> 00:15:40,380]  if you'd like to register for a question, please press star 1 key now.\n",
            "[00:15:40,380 --> 00:15:41,380]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:15:41,380 --> 00:15:50,540]  Our next question comes from Chai Beng Chai of Great Credit Suisse in Hong Kong.\n",
            "[00:15:50,540 --> 00:15:51,540]  Please go ahead.\n",
            "[00:15:51,540 --> 00:15:53,540]  Thank you very much for the call.\n",
            "[00:15:53,540 --> 00:15:55,540]  And again, congratulations on the result.\n",
            "[00:15:55,540 --> 00:15:57,540]  I have two questions.\n",
            "[00:15:57,540 --> 00:16:01,540]  Number one, regarding smartphones penetration trend in Taiwan,\n",
            "[00:16:01,540 --> 00:16:02,540]  how do you see that?\n",
            "[00:16:02,540 --> 00:16:05,540]  Do you see a slowdown in recent months?\n",
            "[00:16:05,540 --> 00:16:08,540]  Or is the growth still very strong?\n",
            "[00:16:08,540 --> 00:16:10,540]  Or is it accelerating?\n",
            "[00:16:10,540 --> 00:16:14,540]  The second question is what's happening at Chung Wah Telecom?\n",
            "[00:16:14,540 --> 00:16:17,540]  I understand that what is happening at your competitor now\n",
            "[00:16:17,540 --> 00:16:22,540]  is that they are offering some kind of a discount to customers who use less data\n",
            "[00:16:22,540 --> 00:16:25,540]  in order to help with the network quality.\n",
            "[00:16:25,540 --> 00:16:28,540]  Are you facing any kind of network constraint as well?\n",
            "[00:16:28,540 --> 00:16:33,540]  Or would you consider some kind of matching in terms of the discount\n",
            "[00:16:33,540 --> 00:16:38,540]  or price reduction to COVID competition?\n",
            "[00:16:38,540 --> 00:16:39,540]  That's all my questions.\n",
            "[00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:40,540]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:16:40,540 --> 00:16:41,540]  Okay.\n",
            "[00:16:41,540 --> 00:16:44,540]  The first question about the smartphone penetration trend,\n",
            "[00:16:44,540 --> 00:16:51,540]  we see that smartphone has become a very stable and consistent trend.\n",
            "[00:16:51,540 --> 00:16:56,540]  So the smartphone penetration will increase consistently.\n",
            "[00:16:56,540 --> 00:16:59,540]  Even though there wouldn't be a big jump,\n",
            "[00:16:59,540 --> 00:17:06,540]  but I see the smartphone penetration will get more further and higher and higher.\n",
            "[00:17:06,540 --> 00:17:11,540]  So every month we see the smartphone sales increase a little bit.\n",
            "[00:17:11,540 --> 00:17:15,620]  So it's very positive.\n",
            "[00:17:15,620 --> 00:17:20,620]  Secondly, CHD has problems with the network, so they offer a discount.\n",
            "[00:17:20,620 --> 00:17:23,620]  And this discount really doesn't affect us\n",
            "[00:17:23,620 --> 00:17:28,620]  because that is due to their network cannot deliver the kind of speed.\n",
            "[00:17:28,620 --> 00:17:29,620]  In the meantime,\n",
            "[00:17:29,620 --> 00:17:37,620]  Power Mobile in July has offered a 21 meg service to general public\n",
            "[00:17:37,620 --> 00:17:40,620]  in five metropolitan areas.\n",
            "[00:17:40,620 --> 00:17:47,720]  So we are quite confident our network can deliver a better service,\n",
            "[00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:49,720]  a better quality service to the consumers.\n",
            "[00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:56,720]  So CHD discount really doesn't impact our performance.\n",
            "[00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:58,650]  Thank you very much.\n",
            "[00:17:58,650 --> 00:18:01,650]  Just a follow-up question on the first one.\n",
            "[00:18:01,650 --> 00:18:06,740]  Would you be able to share with me what's the percentage of the smartphone sales\n",
            "[00:18:06,740 --> 00:18:10,740]  as a percentage of the total handset sales currently?\n",
            "[00:18:10,740 --> 00:18:11,740]  And also the second question,\n",
            "[00:18:11,740 --> 00:18:15,740]  is there any indication in terms of network utilization,\n",
            "[00:18:16,740 --> 00:18:20,740]  how much you can cope with an increase in data traffic or anything\n",
            "[00:18:20,740 --> 00:18:25,740]  that provides some numerical guidance on that, please?\n",
            "[00:18:25,740 --> 00:18:32,740]  Well, currently 50% of our total handset sales is smartphone.\n",
            "[00:18:32,740 --> 00:18:34,740]  And as for the network,\n",
            "[00:18:34,740 --> 00:18:41,740]  I believe currently we have installed more 21 meg base stations\n",
            "[00:18:41,740 --> 00:18:46,740]  and more 42 meg base stations than CHD and FET.\n",
            "[00:18:46,740 --> 00:18:49,740]  I'm sorry I cannot disclose the number,\n",
            "[00:18:49,740 --> 00:18:57,740]  but we are quite confident we have a higher speed network compared with CHD\n",
            "[00:18:57,740 --> 00:18:59,740]  and certainly FET.\n",
            "[00:18:59,740 --> 00:19:02,480]  Thank you very much.\n",
            "[00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:04,410]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:19:04,410 --> 00:19:05,410]  One second, ladies and gentlemen.\n",
            "[00:19:05,410 --> 00:19:07,410]  If you would like to register for a question,\n",

            "[00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:20,480]  If you would like to register for a question,\n",

            "[00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:23,480]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:28,480]  Our next question comes from May Lin of Yanta, Taipei.\n",
            "[00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:29,480]  Please go ahead.\n",
            "[00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:31,220]  Hi.\n",
            "[00:19:31,220 --> 00:19:32,220]  Thanks for the call.\n",
            "[00:19:32,220 --> 00:19:33,220]  I have two questions.\n",
            "[00:19:33,220 --> 00:19:34,220]  First is about in third quarter,\n",
            "[00:19:34,220 --> 00:19:40,220]  there's some tax reversal and also operating expense reversal.\n",
            "[00:19:40,220 --> 00:19:44,220]  Can you offer us the detail of the source of this reversal?\n",
            "[00:19:44,220 --> 00:19:48,220]  And second question is that can you remind us about your CATAS guidance\n",
            "[00:19:48,220 --> 00:19:50,220]  for this year and next two years?\n",
            "[00:19:50,220 --> 00:19:51,760]  Thanks.\n",
            "[00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:52,760]  Okay.\n",
            "[00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:55,760]  Let me answer your second question first, which is an easy one.\n",
            "[00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:59,760]  Our CATAS target for this year is $7.3 billion,\n",
            "[00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:06,050]  and it remains the same toward the end of the year.\n",
            "[00:20:06,050 --> 00:20:11,050]  And for the next two years, we haven't finished our guidance for next year,\n",
            "[00:20:11,050 --> 00:20:20,050]  so you'll have to wait until January 19th, the next conference call date.\n",
            "[00:20:20,050 --> 00:20:29,050]  And on the reversals, we have finalized our tax appeals\n",
            "[00:20:29,050 --> 00:20:32,050]  with the tax authorities this year.\n",
            "[00:20:33,050 --> 00:20:42,050]  So there were some tax reversals totaling about half a billion\n",
            "[00:20:42,050 --> 00:20:50,270]  and also some reversals of operating expenses,\n",
            "[00:20:50,270 --> 00:20:57,270]  which is of a much smaller amount due to over-approved amounts\n",
            "[00:20:57,270 --> 00:20:59,270]  as compared to budgets.\n",
            "[00:20:59,270 --> 00:21:01,650]  Okay.\n",
            "[00:21:01,650 --> 00:21:02,650]  Thank you very much.\n",
            "[00:21:02,650 --> 00:21:05,650]  I have a follow-up question on the MOMO side.\n",
            "[00:21:05,650 --> 00:21:09,650]  In the slide you mentioned about that this quarter,\n",
            "[00:21:09,650 --> 00:21:14,650]  the margins suffer from the product mix and some startup costs.\n",
            "[00:21:14,650 --> 00:21:18,650]  Can you give us more color about the future outlook on MOMO's margin side\n",
            "[00:21:18,650 --> 00:21:20,650]  and also top-line growth?\n",
            "[00:21:20,650 --> 00:21:23,650]  Thank you very much.\n",
            "[00:21:23,650 --> 00:21:29,650]  As Vivian said, in the second quarter of this year,\n",
            "[00:21:29,650 --> 00:21:36,650]  MOMO is trying to restructure the product mix,\n",
            "[00:21:36,650 --> 00:21:39,650]  moving away from the dietary supplement,\n",
            "[00:21:39,650 --> 00:21:42,650]  which is a high-margin product,\n",
            "[00:21:42,650 --> 00:21:47,650]  to some products which are more consumer electronics.\n",
            "[00:21:47,650 --> 00:21:49,650]  The margin is lower.\n",
            "[00:21:49,650 --> 00:21:54,650]  So it takes some time for them to do this product mix adjustment,\n",
            "[00:21:54,650 --> 00:21:57,650]  but I think they are on track\n",
            "[00:21:57,650 --> 00:22:00,650]  and the performance is improving.\n",
            "[00:22:00,650 --> 00:22:04,650]  As we move to the third and fourth quarter,\n",
            "[00:22:04,650 --> 00:22:11,620]  the operation result is getting better.\n",
            "[00:22:11,620 --> 00:22:12,620]  Okay.\n",
            "[00:22:12,620 --> 00:22:15,000]  Thank you very much.\n",
            "[00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,000]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000]  Our next question comes from Gary Yu of MOMO Stand in Hong Kong.\n",
            "[00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,000]  Please go ahead.\n",
            "[00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,000]  Hi.\n",
            "[00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:24,000]  Thanks for the opportunity for me to ask questions.\n",
            "[00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,000]  I have two questions from my side.\n",
            "[00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:31,000]  First, given you are starting to offer some of the mid-end handsets\n",
            "[00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:34,000]  or mid-end smartphones in the market,\n",
            "[00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:37,000]  in terms of Apple comparison with iPhone\n",
            "[00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:41,030]  or some of the other high-end HTC smartphones,\n",
            "[00:22:41,030 --> 00:22:45,030]  what do you see in terms of the smartphones of Apple\n",
            "[00:22:45,030 --> 00:22:47,030]  and do you see this trend coming down\n",
            "[00:22:47,030 --> 00:22:52,030]  as you're moving towards more to the mid-end segment?\n",
            "[00:22:52,030 --> 00:22:57,030]  Second question I have is if I look at some of the other markets\n",
            "[00:22:57,030 --> 00:23:01,030]  who have already announced the pricing for iPhone 4S,\n",
            "[00:23:01,030 --> 00:23:05,030]  I realize that some of these markets actually price iPhone 4S\n",
            "[00:23:05,030 --> 00:23:11,030]  a little bit higher than iPhone 4 in terms of the monthly data plan.\n",
            "[00:23:11,030 --> 00:23:14,030]  As you are going to launch the iPhone 4S,\n",
            "[00:23:14,030 --> 00:23:20,030]  do you have any room to increase your data plan\n",
            "[00:23:20,030 --> 00:23:23,030]  compared to your previous iPhone 4 packages?\n",
            "[00:23:23,030 --> 00:23:25,450]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:23:25,450 --> 00:23:27,450]  Gary, we could not hear your first question.\n",
            "[00:23:27,450 --> 00:23:29,450]  Yeah, could you please repeat?\n",
            "[00:23:29,450 --> 00:23:30,450]  Yeah, sure.\n",
            "[00:23:30,450 --> 00:23:35,450]  The first question is basically regarding your mid-end smartphones, Apple.\n",
            "[00:23:35,450 --> 00:23:38,450]  Do you see any substantial difference comparing with your iPhone\n",
            "[00:23:38,450 --> 00:23:41,450]  or high-end HTC Apple?\n",
            "[00:23:41,450 --> 00:23:46,450]  Also, if you can share with us out of your total smartphone sales,\n",
            "[00:23:46,450 --> 00:23:49,450]  what is the percentage of those mid-end smartphones\n",
            "[00:23:49,450 --> 00:23:55,610]  accounted for in terms of the third quarter that you have seen?\n",
            "[00:24:09,420 --> 00:24:17,420]  For a high-end smartphone like HTC Sensation or Samsung Galaxy S2,\n",
            "[00:24:17,420 --> 00:24:22,420]  the Apple is roughly the same like iPhone.\n",
            "[00:24:22,420 --> 00:24:24,420]  There is really not much difference.\n",
            "[00:24:24,420 --> 00:24:28,420]  And the percentage of iPhone has dropped in the third quarter\n",
            "[00:24:28,420 --> 00:24:31,520]  in our total smartphone portfolio.\n",
            "[00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:41,840]  I think, let me see, it's less than 25% in our total smartphone portfolio.\n",
            "[00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:49,840]  And currently, we sell a lot of middle-end smartphones and low-end smartphones.\n",
            "[00:24:49,840 --> 00:25:03,690]  So the high-end smartphone takes up, I think, roughly 30% of our total smartphone sales.\n",
            "[00:25:03,690 --> 00:25:05,690]  30% roughly.\n",
            "[00:25:05,690 --> 00:25:11,690]  And the rest is really middle, high, middle, and then middle, low smartphone.\n",
            "[00:25:11,690 --> 00:25:28,070]  So, for instance, in October, the high-end is really roughly 30%, roughly.\n",
            "[00:25:28,070 --> 00:25:31,070]  So, that's the case.\n",
            "[00:25:31,070 --> 00:25:37,580]  And for iPhone 4S subsidy, up to now,\n",
            "[00:25:37,580 --> 00:25:45,580]  Apple hasn't talked with us regarding the iPhone 4S pricing and the subsidy level.\n",
            "[00:25:45,580 --> 00:25:58,280]  But the general feeling is that, our thinking is that we try to control the subsidy level of iPhone 4S.\n",
            "[00:25:58,280 --> 00:26:03,630]  So, this is something we have to negotiate with Apple.\n",
            "[00:26:03,630 --> 00:26:08,860]  And we just have to wait and see what's the position of Apple.\n",
            "[00:26:08,860 --> 00:26:16,620]  So, it's possible that iPhone 4S could be a little more expensive.\n",
            "[00:26:16,620 --> 00:26:22,220]  It really depends on the pricing of iPhone 4S.\n",
            "[00:26:22,220 --> 00:26:28,370]  So, the answer is, we don't know at the moment.\n",
            "[00:26:28,370 --> 00:26:33,370]  Just to follow up on that, in terms of the mid-end smartphone,\n",
            "[00:26:33,370 --> 00:26:48,870]  are you seeing any difference in terms of Apple compared to your high-end smartphone users?\n",
            "[00:26:48,870 --> 00:26:55,870]  Of course, the mid-end smartphone users tend not to subscribe to all-you-can-eat,\n",
            "[00:26:56,870 --> 00:27:02,870]  so their Apple, in general, is lower than the high-end smartphone.\n",
            "[00:27:02,870 --> 00:27:07,870]  High-end smartphone users tend to subscribe to our all-you-can-eat data plan.\n",
            "[00:27:07,870 --> 00:27:15,380]  Okay, thank you.\n",
            "[00:27:15,380 --> 00:27:19,380]  Thank you. The next question comes from Fei Ling of UBS Hong Kong. Please go ahead.\n",
            "[00:27:19,380 --> 00:27:23,410]  Hello. Just a housekeeping question.\n",
            "[00:27:23,410 --> 00:27:30,410]  I'm wondering where the $500 million of tax reversal is added into your financials.\n",
            "[00:27:30,410 --> 00:27:32,410]  Is it in the EBITDA line?\n",
            "[00:27:32,410 --> 00:27:36,440]  No, it's not. It's in the tax expense. It's been reversed.\n",
            "[00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:44,440]  So, if you look at the tax expense, you'll see much less amount\n",
            "[00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:52,110]  because it's been deducted by the tax reversal amount.\n",
            "[00:27:52,110 --> 00:27:53,110]  Okay, got it.\n",
            "[00:27:53,110 --> 00:27:58,110]  In your MD&A, I can see that you mentioned that the reversal of over-accrued operating expenses\n",
            "[00:27:58,110 --> 00:28:03,110]  is put into CBG's EBITDA line. Can you share with us how much that is?\n",
            "[00:28:03,110 --> 00:28:18,540]  It's about $0.2 billion.\n",
            "[00:28:18,540 --> 00:28:23,540]  Okay. So, quarter on quarter, your EBITDA grew by $1 billion.\n",
            "[00:28:23,540 --> 00:28:28,540]  About $200 million is from the reversal, and another $200 million is from Momo,\n",
            "[00:28:28,540 --> 00:28:33,540]  and the rest is basically from organic operational growth.\n",
            "[00:28:33,540 --> 00:28:41,540]  Yeah, you can put it that way, but you probably should look at it differently\n",
            "[00:28:41,540 --> 00:28:44,540]  from the reversal point of view.\n",
            "[00:28:44,540 --> 00:28:53,540]  This kind of reversal happens sometimes because we over-accrued our expense,\n",
            "[00:28:53,540 --> 00:28:58,540]  I mean, according to the budget, but the actual expense is much lower,\n",
            "[00:28:58,540 --> 00:29:04,540]  especially for bad debts. For smart devices, to reduce our risk,\n",
            "[00:29:04,540 --> 00:29:19,540]  we have demanded subscribers to pay up from certain months of deposits to secure our credits.\n",
            "[00:29:19,540 --> 00:29:31,070]  So, that explains why there was the kind of reversal.\n",
            "[00:29:31,070 --> 00:29:38,070]  Got it, got it. And the accrual is from this year, the over-accrual?\n",
            "[00:29:38,070 --> 00:29:42,070]  This year and a little bit of last year.\n",
            "[00:29:42,070 --> 00:29:46,190]  Okay, got it. Thank you very much.\n",
            "[00:29:46,190 --> 00:29:50,190]  Thank you. And this question comes from Chase Bencher of Credit Suisse in Hong Kong.\n",
            "[00:29:50,190 --> 00:29:52,190]  Please go ahead.\n",
            "[00:29:52,190 --> 00:29:55,190]  Hi, thank you very much. I just have two follow-up questions.\n",
            "[00:29:55,190 --> 00:29:59,190]  The first one is on the medium-end smartphones.\n",
            "[00:29:59,190 --> 00:30:06,190]  You mentioned that they are not subscribing to the unlimited package.\n",
            "[00:30:06,190 --> 00:30:08,190]  So, what is the popular package for them?\n",
            "[00:30:08,190 --> 00:30:14,190]  Is this like just in the middle end or how much data these kinds are basically subscribing to?\n",
            "[00:30:14,190 --> 00:30:17,190]  The second question is on the capital reduction.\n",
            "[00:30:17,190 --> 00:30:20,190]  I'm not sure whether you can provide any indications or your view\n",
            "[00:30:20,190 --> 00:30:22,190]  on further capital reduction from here.\n",
            "[00:30:22,190 --> 00:30:26,190]  Any target gearing that you would want to be at or anything like that?\n",
            "[00:30:26,190 --> 00:30:28,610]  Thank you very much.\n",
            "[00:30:28,610 --> 00:30:35,610]  For the middle end, the most popular data plan they subscribe is,\n",
            "[00:30:35,610 --> 00:30:45,570]  one is a US$6.5 plan, which gives them 100 MB data package.\n",
            "[00:30:45,570 --> 00:31:03,710]  And the other one is US$15 and gives them 500 MB data.\n",
            "[00:31:03,710 --> 00:31:10,710]  So, that's the two most popular data plans for them to use for the middle end models.\n",
            "[00:31:10,710 --> 00:31:18,970]  And as for the capital reduction, Rosie?\n",
            "[00:31:18,970 --> 00:31:23,970]  On the capital reduction front, we don't rule out the possibility,\n",
            "[00:31:23,970 --> 00:31:26,970]  but, you know, it's up to the board to decide.\n",
            "[00:31:26,970 --> 00:31:34,970]  There's still quite a lot of room for us to do some capital management,\n",
            "[00:31:34,970 --> 00:31:39,970]  but, of course, it's up to the board to decide.\n",
            "[00:31:39,970 --> 00:31:50,970]  And I believe you know that we have US$3.1 billion in unappropriated earnings bills\n",
            "[00:31:50,970 --> 00:31:54,970]  and we have US$12.4 billion in capital surplus.\n",
            "[00:31:54,970 --> 00:32:00,970]  And in addition to these two numbers, we also have some room in the capital base.\n",
            "[00:32:00,970 --> 00:32:07,830]  Thank you very much.\n",
            "[00:32:07,830 --> 00:32:08,830]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:32:08,830 --> 00:32:09,830]  One second, ladies and gentlemen.\n",
            "[00:32:09,830 --> 00:32:12,830]  If you'd like to register for a question, please press star 1 key now.\n",

            "[00:32:39,010 --> 00:32:42,010]  and thank you very much for the opportunity to ask a question.\n",
            "[00:32:42,010 --> 00:32:49,010]  One quick question, if I may, just to follow up on the potential that you have for capital management.\n",
            "[00:32:49,010 --> 00:32:55,010]  You know, should, you know, the board be considering, you know, some activity in that area?\n",
            "[00:32:55,010 --> 00:32:59,010]  What kind of timing would you expect that to be in terms of a board decision?\n",
            "[00:32:59,010 --> 00:33:01,010]  When does it usually happen?\n",
            "[00:33:01,010 --> 00:33:09,060]  And is there any change to that time frame, you know, this year in terms of consideration and decision there?\n",
            "[00:33:09,060 --> 00:33:14,160]  As you know that we just had capital reduction.\n",
            "[00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:18,160]  So we don't have any timetable for that.\n",
            "[00:33:18,160 --> 00:33:21,160]  It's purely up to the board to decide.\n",
            "[00:33:21,160 --> 00:33:25,700]  So I could not give you a specific answer on that.\n",
            "[00:33:25,700 --> 00:33:29,020]  Okay, thank you very much.\n",

            "[00:33:34,500 --> 00:33:38,500]  Thank you and congratulations on a very good result.\n",
            "[00:33:38,500 --> 00:33:40,500]  I've got three kind of quick questions.\n",
            "[00:33:40,500 --> 00:33:45,500]  Firstly, can you give us a little bit more overview on your new stores\n",
            "[00:33:45,500 --> 00:33:48,500]  and the actual number of self-run stores now?\n",
            "[00:33:48,500 --> 00:33:51,500]  I remember previously you discussed about increasing that percentage.\n",
            "[00:33:51,500 --> 00:33:54,500]  I'm just wondering what percentages they are at the moment\n",
            "[00:33:54,500 --> 00:33:59,500]  and how many new stores that you're referring to have you added to date?\n",
            "[00:33:59,500 --> 00:34:02,500]  And in addition to that, in terms of the smartphones,\n",
            "[00:34:02,500 --> 00:34:08,500]  you talked about the percentage of smartphone growth penetration continue to increase.\n",
            "[00:34:08,500 --> 00:34:13,500]  Can you give us an idea maybe what we're looking at there in terms of that increase?\n",
            "[00:34:13,500 --> 00:34:18,500]  And thirdly, on the digital TV for your cable subscribers,\n",
            "[00:34:18,500 --> 00:34:21,500]  what exactly do you find is driving that now?\n",
            "[00:34:21,500 --> 00:34:26,500]  Is that going to come more from broadband penetration to cable subscribers?\n",
            "[00:34:26,500 --> 00:34:31,500]  Are you getting kind of a high percentage of your overall TV subs\n",
            "[00:34:31,500 --> 00:34:34,500]  or are you going to do new incentives?\n",
            "[00:34:34,500 --> 00:34:37,500]  Just what's your strategy there to continue to grow that?\n",
            "[00:34:37,500 --> 00:34:40,880]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:34:40,880 --> 00:34:47,880]  Now, currently we have roughly 260-something stores at the moment.\n",
            "[00:34:47,880 --> 00:34:51,550]  So we intend to open more.\n",
            "[00:34:51,550 --> 00:34:54,550]  So we are doing planning for the next year.\n",
            "[00:34:54,550 --> 00:34:58,550]  Maybe by January next year we can share some line\n",
            "[00:34:58,550 --> 00:35:02,030]  regarding how many stores we are going to open for next year.\n",
            "[00:35:02,030 --> 00:35:08,130]  As for smartphone penetration, up to November,\n",
            "[00:35:08,130 --> 00:35:11,130]  up to the third quarter we have 18% penetration\n",
            "[00:35:11,130 --> 00:35:17,130]  and we expect to reach 20% penetration at the year end.\n",
            "[00:35:17,130 --> 00:35:24,130]  As for cable TV, the major driver is really in mobile broadband.\n",
            "[00:35:24,130 --> 00:35:27,130]  In the third quarter of this year,\n",
            "[00:35:27,130 --> 00:35:33,130]  CHT announced they are going to push for 20Mbps or 50Mbps service.\n",
            "[00:35:33,130 --> 00:35:38,130]  However, in the cable TV area we control,\n",
            "[00:35:38,130 --> 00:35:44,130]  we have the ability to offer a 50Mbps service to compete with CHT.\n",
            "[00:35:44,130 --> 00:35:52,480]  And we only have the penetration of cable modem is still only 20-something.\n",
            "[00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:55,480]  So we expect in the next several years,\n",
            "[00:35:55,480 --> 00:35:58,480]  we still can see some growth in this area\n",
            "[00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:03,480]  because long-term-wise, I don't see any reason why we cannot reach\n",
            "[00:36:03,480 --> 00:36:08,640]  30% or 40% penetration in our area we cover.\n",
            "[00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:11,640]  Of course, another growth area is DTV.\n",
            "[00:36:11,640 --> 00:36:14,640]  This year, as you can see, we have tremendous growth.\n",
            "[00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:20,930]  But this is an area where the output is lower.\n",
            "[00:36:20,930 --> 00:36:26,930]  It also depends on a lot of government regulations regarding how to do it.\n",
            "[00:36:26,930 --> 00:36:29,930]  And we are still talking with NCC trying to see\n",
            "[00:36:29,930 --> 00:36:32,930]  whether we can increase the DTV penetration.\n",
            "[00:36:32,930 --> 00:36:38,930]  In the meantime, cut down our expenses in promoting this service\n",
            "[00:36:38,930 --> 00:36:41,930]  because currently the margin of DTV is lower.\n",
            "[00:36:41,930 --> 00:36:46,150]  But it has a tremendous growth opportunity\n",
            "[00:36:46,150 --> 00:36:51,150]  because we also represent a lot of high-definition programming in Taiwan.\n",
            "[00:36:51,150 --> 00:36:54,150]  Therefore, we see a strong uptake in the future.\n",
            "[00:36:54,150 --> 00:37:03,500]  And also, basically, there is another area that could grow our business.\n",
            "[00:37:03,500 --> 00:37:09,500]  It's not only increasing our penetration rate.\n",
            "[00:37:09,500 --> 00:37:13,500]  We could also upsell our higher-fee broadband services\n",
            "[00:37:13,500 --> 00:37:18,500]  to the same household to grow our ARPU.\n",
            "[00:37:18,500 --> 00:37:24,500]  That has been going on and has been contributing to the growth.\n",
            "[00:37:24,500 --> 00:37:28,290]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:37:28,290 --> 00:37:33,290]  Just to follow up on both the smartphone and the cable side,\n",
            "[00:37:33,290 --> 00:37:36,290]  on the smartphone side, if you're currently at 18% penetration\n",
            "[00:37:36,290 --> 00:37:39,290]  and you're aiming to get 20% by year-end,\n",
            "[00:37:39,290 --> 00:37:43,290]  so we say roughly 2% addition per quarter,\n",
            "[00:37:43,290 --> 00:37:45,290]  have you noticed that that has been ‚Äì\n",
            "[00:37:45,290 --> 00:37:49,290]  would you say that has slowed on a quarterly basis compared to previous?\n",
            "[00:37:49,290 --> 00:37:53,290]  I'm just trying to get an idea of how you see that progressing.\n",
            "[00:37:53,290 --> 00:37:58,290]  And then on the cable side, if you're talking about the digital TV side,\n",
            "[00:37:58,290 --> 00:38:02,290]  what exactly with NCC do you think would help you cut the expenses?\n",
            "[00:38:02,290 --> 00:38:08,290]  What exactly is the issue with expenses for the digital TV robot?\n",
            "[00:38:09,290 --> 00:38:14,290]  As for the first issue, smartphone,\n",
            "[00:38:14,290 --> 00:38:18,290]  we see the consistent demand for smartphone.\n",
            "[00:38:18,290 --> 00:38:23,290]  So we don't see the demand is softening.\n",
            "[00:38:23,290 --> 00:38:27,290]  So the penetration is increasing all the time.\n",
            "[00:38:27,290 --> 00:38:31,450]  As for the digital TV,\n",
            "[00:38:31,450 --> 00:38:36,740]  Taiwan is moving from analog TV to digital TV.\n",
            "[00:38:36,740 --> 00:38:41,740]  But the government currently doesn't specify,\n",
            "[00:38:41,740 --> 00:38:43,740]  if you offer digital TV,\n",
            "[00:38:43,740 --> 00:38:48,150]  how many free set-top box you need to offer to a household.\n",
            "[00:38:48,150 --> 00:38:50,150]  From our point of view,\n",
            "[00:38:50,150 --> 00:38:54,150]  one set-top box is good enough for the household.\n",
            "[00:38:54,150 --> 00:38:59,150]  But maybe NCC think that in order to convert from analog TV to digital TV,\n",
            "[00:38:59,150 --> 00:39:02,150]  we need to offer additional free set-top box.\n",
            "[00:39:02,150 --> 00:39:06,150]  And additional free set-top box will increase our expenses.\n",
            "[00:39:06,150 --> 00:39:09,150]  This is the kind of issue we are talking with NCC.\n",
            "[00:39:09,150 --> 00:39:14,150]  We want to increase the digitization of cable TV.\n",
            "[00:39:14,150 --> 00:39:17,150]  But in the meantime, we try to control the expenses\n",
            "[00:39:17,150 --> 00:39:20,150]  because the set-top box is the major investment,\n",
            "[00:39:20,150 --> 00:39:23,150]  cost item for digital TV penetration.\n",
            "[00:39:23,150 --> 00:39:27,850]  Thank you, Cliff. Thank you, Vivian. Very helpful.\n",
            "[00:39:27,850 --> 00:39:29,900]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:39:29,900 --> 00:39:32,900]  Our next question comes from Raphia of Citigo.com. Please go ahead.\n",
            "[00:39:32,900 --> 00:39:33,900]  Thank you very much.\n",
            "[00:39:33,900 --> 00:39:36,900]  I have a quick question, if I may, about Momo.\n",
            "[00:39:36,900 --> 00:39:40,900]  I know it's still relatively early days post the acquisition.\n",
            "[00:39:40,900 --> 00:39:44,900]  But also, I know that one of the key strategic imperatives you talked about\n",
            "[00:39:44,900 --> 00:39:48,900]  was evolving Momo toward an attractive smartphone-based\n",
            "[00:39:48,900 --> 00:39:52,900]  M-Commerce proposition, perhaps through a set of apps and services.\n",
            "[00:39:52,900 --> 00:39:54,900]  I was wondering if you could share with us,\n",
            "[00:39:54,900 --> 00:39:56,900]  if there are any data points at this early stage,\n",
            "[00:39:56,900 --> 00:39:59,900]  any progress you've made there\n",
            "[00:39:59,900 --> 00:40:02,900]  or any updates on plans that you have in that area.\n",
            "[00:40:02,900 --> 00:40:08,980]  Well, we do have some planning.\n",
            "[00:40:08,980 --> 00:40:13,980]  But at this moment, we are not...\n",
            "[00:40:13,980 --> 00:40:22,270]  I don't feel comfortable to disclose anything in public now\n",
            "[00:40:22,270 --> 00:40:26,270]  because, as you know, M-Commerce and E-Commerce are all...\n",
            "[00:40:26,270 --> 00:40:34,270]  are also two areas where our competitors are focusing on.\n",
            "[00:40:34,270 --> 00:40:42,040]  So maybe we will wait until the right time to disclose.\n",
            "[00:40:42,040 --> 00:40:44,780]  Understood. Thank you very much.\n",
            "[00:40:44,780 --> 00:40:45,940]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:40:45,940 --> 00:40:48,940]  Once again, ladies and gentlemen, if you'd like to register for a question,\n",

            "[00:40:51,940 --> 00:40:52,940]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:40:52,940 --> 00:40:58,570]  Next, we have a follow-up question from Mei-Lin of Yanta Taiwan.\n",
            "[00:40:58,570 --> 00:40:59,570]  Please go ahead.\n",
            "[00:40:59,570 --> 00:41:01,570]  Yes, thanks to take my question again.\n",
            "[00:41:01,570 --> 00:41:02,570]  A quick question.\n",
            "[00:41:02,570 --> 00:41:06,570]  We, our CEBG Enterprise Business Group,\n",
            "[00:41:06,570 --> 00:41:11,050]  EBITDA margin actually improved a lot this quarter,\n",
            "[00:41:11,050 --> 00:41:13,050]  sorry, in third quarter,\n",
            "[00:41:13,050 --> 00:41:16,050]  and in your slides you point that it's due to the cost-saving\n",
            "[00:41:16,050 --> 00:41:18,050]  and revenue increase.\n",
            "[00:41:18,050 --> 00:41:20,050]  Can you also give us some color about,\n",
            "[00:41:20,050 --> 00:41:24,050]  do you think this EBITDA level can be sustainable going forward\n",
            "[00:41:24,050 --> 00:41:27,050]  or there is also something like one-off impact inside it?\n",
            "[00:41:27,050 --> 00:41:32,320]  Thank you very much.\n",
            "[00:41:33,320 --> 00:41:36,320]  Well, I think we are making some progress\n",
            "[00:41:36,320 --> 00:41:40,350]  in the Enterprise Business Group.\n",
            "[00:41:40,350 --> 00:41:43,350]  So the EBITDA margin is improving,\n",
            "[00:41:43,350 --> 00:41:49,350]  but we also see a trend for the enterprise business customers.\n",
            "[00:41:49,350 --> 00:41:53,350]  They are switching to smartphones more and more.\n",
            "[00:41:53,350 --> 00:41:59,350]  So potentially this will increase the subsidy we provide\n",
            "[00:41:59,350 --> 00:42:02,020]  to our enterprise customers.\n",
            "[00:42:02,020 --> 00:42:05,020]  Therefore, we are still doing planning.\n",
            "[00:42:05,020 --> 00:42:08,020]  But other than the subsidy level,\n",
            "[00:42:08,020 --> 00:42:11,020]  other than the divided subsidy,\n",
            "[00:42:11,020 --> 00:42:18,020]  we see some improvement in our EBG EBITDA consistently.\n",
            "[00:42:18,020 --> 00:42:20,080]  Okay, understood.\n",
            "[00:42:20,080 --> 00:42:26,080]  So is this correct for me to read that in terms of core EBITDA level\n",
            "[00:42:26,080 --> 00:42:27,080]  actually is improving,\n",
            "[00:42:27,080 --> 00:42:32,080]  but there might be some impact in the future due to some subsidy\n",
            "[00:42:33,080 --> 00:42:34,080]  change?\n",
            "[00:42:34,080 --> 00:42:35,080]  Yes.\n",
            "[00:42:35,080 --> 00:42:37,080]  Okay, thank you very much.\n",
            "[00:42:37,080 --> 00:42:39,070]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:42:39,070 --> 00:42:40,070]  Once again, ladies and gentlemen,\n",

            "[00:43:05,770 --> 00:43:09,770]  Next, we have another follow-up question from Mr. Jay Bancher of Credit Suisse.\n",

            "[00:43:10,770 --> 00:43:14,770]  Yes, thank you very much for another question from me.\n",
            "[00:43:14,770 --> 00:43:16,770]  Just to make sure that I didn't miss anything.\n",
            "[00:43:16,770 --> 00:43:20,770]  So you basically maintain the guidance for the fourth quarter in the full year\n",
            "[00:43:20,770 --> 00:43:21,770]  and no change to that.\n",
            "[00:43:21,770 --> 00:43:23,770]  Is that right?\n",

            "[00:43:28,790 --> 00:43:31,790]  Next, we have a follow-up question from Joseph Lin of Macquarie, Taiwan.\n",
            "[00:43:31,790 --> 00:43:33,790]  Please go ahead.\n",
            "[00:43:33,790 --> 00:43:34,790]  Thanks again.\n",
            "[00:43:34,790 --> 00:43:36,790]  Just in terms of tablet PCs,\n",
            "[00:43:36,790 --> 00:43:40,790]  I see some of your competitors being very aggressive on that front,\n",
            "[00:43:40,790 --> 00:43:43,790]  and you do have some in your stores here locally,\n",
            "[00:43:43,790 --> 00:43:45,790]  but not to a very large extent.\n",
            "[00:43:45,790 --> 00:43:48,790]  Can you just talk over your thoughts on that\n",
            "[00:43:48,790 --> 00:43:51,790]  in terms of how you would like that to balance out?\n",
            "[00:43:51,790 --> 00:43:54,790]  Do you think tablets will be more of a network phenomenon\n",
            "[00:43:54,790 --> 00:43:56,790]  and thus replacing those type of users,\n",
            "[00:43:56,790 --> 00:44:00,790]  or do you think that's a new real growth area?\n",
            "[00:44:00,790 --> 00:44:08,820]  I think tablets, we sell as many tablets as our competitors.\n",
            "[00:44:08,820 --> 00:44:13,820]  Some of our branded tablets like my iPad 2 sell very well.\n",
            "[00:44:13,820 --> 00:44:19,820]  Actually, the volume is higher than any of the tablets we have sold.\n",
            "[00:44:19,820 --> 00:44:26,820]  However, as you know, the tablets in general can only have data output,\n",
            "[00:44:26,820 --> 00:44:28,820]  doesn't have voice output.\n",
            "[00:44:28,820 --> 00:44:35,370]  So the safety level cannot be as high as for a smartphone.\n",
            "[00:44:36,370 --> 00:44:39,370]  This is the reason why all the three major operators\n",
            "[00:44:39,370 --> 00:44:46,530]  are more conservative in selling the tablets.\n",
            "[00:44:46,530 --> 00:44:54,530]  Another reason is that we expect to see strong Android tablets\n",
            "[00:44:54,530 --> 00:44:59,530]  in the second quarter or third quarter, but that didn't materialize.\n",
            "[00:44:59,530 --> 00:45:08,690]  I think with the Amazon Kindle Fire, the Acer, Asus, Samsung,\n",
            "[00:45:08,690 --> 00:45:13,690]  these Android players, and with the new iScreen software,\n",
            "[00:45:13,690 --> 00:45:19,780]  they will be more aggressive in the tablets' pricing and offering.\n",
            "[00:45:19,780 --> 00:45:30,010]  I see next year the tablets will become a major sell item in our portfolio.\n",
            "[00:45:30,010 --> 00:45:34,320]  Thanks, Cliff. Very helpful. Thanks.\n",
            "[00:45:34,320 --> 00:45:35,540]  Thank you.\n",

            "[00:45:44,110 --> 00:45:46,110]  Next, we have a follow-up question from Robbie.\n",
            "[00:45:46,110 --> 00:45:47,110]  Please go ahead.\n",
            "[00:45:47,110 --> 00:45:50,110]  A quick follow-up question around tablets, if I may.\n",
            "[00:45:51,110 --> 00:45:57,110]  For the third quarter, I was wondering if your total tablet additions,\n",
            "[00:45:57,110 --> 00:46:00,110]  including understanding that you don't sell the iPad,\n",
            "[00:46:00,110 --> 00:46:04,110]  including micro-SIMs that will be used for iPads,\n",
            "[00:46:04,110 --> 00:46:08,110]  I was wondering if they made up a significant percentage of your ads\n",
            "[00:46:08,110 --> 00:46:11,460]  for the quarter.\n",
            "[00:46:11,460 --> 00:46:13,460]  I mean, I would expect kind of single-digital,\n",
            "[00:46:13,460 --> 00:46:15,460]  maybe even 10% at a guesstimate,\n",
            "[00:46:15,460 --> 00:46:37,440]  but it would be interesting to know if you have a figure there.\n",
            "[00:46:37,440 --> 00:46:49,660]  In the sales number, we add roughly 15,000 to 20,000 tablet users in our network.\n",
            "[00:46:49,660 --> 00:46:51,660]  During the quarter?\n",
            "[00:46:51,660 --> 00:46:53,660]  During the quarter.\n",

            "[00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:26,580]  First on wireless data, in first quarter, despite a 4.8% worldwide mobile voice revenue decline due to the regulatory interventions,\n",
            "[00:01:26,580 --> 00:01:35,580]  we still managed to increase mobile service revenue by 1% on the back of 46% worldwide growth in wireless data revenue.\n",
            "[00:01:35,580 --> 00:01:42,740]  In terms of data revenue growth and data revenue as a percentage of mobile service revenue,\n",
            "[00:01:42,740 --> 00:01:45,740]  Taiwan Mobile is ahead of the pack in the first quarter.\n",
            "[00:01:45,740 --> 00:01:51,740]  As a result, we reported the highest mobile ARPU among the big three.\n",
            "[00:01:51,740 --> 00:02:03,750]  For our smartphone strategy, apart from the 10 smart devices we have introduced so far this year,\n",
            "[00:02:03,750 --> 00:02:07,750]  we currently have more than 20 smart devices on the market.\n",
            "[00:02:07,750 --> 00:02:16,100]  Smartphone users ARPU remain at more than two times that of post-paid, and their payback periods are very similar.\n",
            "[00:02:16,100 --> 00:02:28,330]  Our smartphone sales volume in first quarter grew 180% from a year ago as a result of more mid-range smart devices sales.\n",
            "[00:02:28,330 --> 00:02:42,410]  As indicated in the table, our internet subscriber number increased of 18% and DPV customer number growth of 160%\n",
            "[00:02:42,410 --> 00:02:48,410]  or higher than 3% subscriber rise in LLTV services in the first quarter.\n",
            "[00:02:48,410 --> 00:02:56,600]  This has contributed to a 3% worldwide increase in blended ARPU for HPG.\n",
            "[00:02:56,600 --> 00:03:01,600]  Given that only 25% of our customers are using our internet services,\n",
            "[00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:08,600]  and 5.3% of our customers have subscribed to digital DV services,\n",
            "[00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:14,950]  we expect further expansion in the internet and DPV service take-up.\n",
            "[00:03:14,950 --> 00:03:21,950]  It is worth mentioning that cable internet ARPU was up 3% from a year ago,\n",
            "[00:03:21,950 --> 00:03:33,950]  with 65% of our newly-acquired customers subscribing to 10 main or above series in first quarter, up around 42% a year ago.\n",
            "[00:03:33,950 --> 00:03:40,980]  Now, let me turn to Vivian for our financial overview.\n",
            "[00:03:40,980 --> 00:03:49,200]  For the first quarter, consolidated revenue and EBITDA surpassed our expectations\n",
            "[00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:55,200]  and achieved 25% and 24% of full-year guidance respectively,\n",
            "[00:03:55,200 --> 00:04:04,200]  mainly due to better-than-expected wireless data revenue as well as higher-than-expected handset sales.\n",
            "[00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:11,200]  Separately, first quarter non-operating expenses also came in less than guidance\n",
            "[00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:17,200]  due to fewer-than-expected asset write-off losses.\n",
            "[00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:23,200]  As such, our net profit achieved 25% of full-year guidance.\n",
            "[00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:29,320]  However, full-year write-off loss will stay as guidance.\n",
            "[00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:33,860]  Please turn to the next page for the divisional performance.\n",
            "[00:04:33,860 --> 00:04:38,860]  For the first quarter, the company's increased smartphone business subsidies\n",
            "[00:04:38,860 --> 00:04:45,860]  were largely offset by strong data revenue growth and savings from G&A.\n",
            "[00:04:45,860 --> 00:04:52,020]  Nevertheless, CBG's EBITDA still reported a decline,\n",
            "[00:04:52,020 --> 00:05:01,020]  attribute mainly to the mandatory tariff cut and lower fixed-to-mobile tariff regulatory by NCC.\n",
            "[00:05:01,020 --> 00:05:07,760]  HBG's profit rise came from better economics of scale,\n",
            "[00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:13,760]  sending its EBITDA margin to a new high of 51.9%\n",
            "[00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:19,920]  and higher blended output as explained by Cliff in previous slides.\n",
            "[00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:27,920]  EBG's first quarter profit growth is underpinned by rising enterprise mobile and roaming revenue,\n",
            "[00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:30,920]  coupled with content expenses.\n",
            "[00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:40,920]  For the first quarter, both EBG's and HBG's EBITDA maintained a healthy double-digit YOY growth\n",
            "[00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:45,920]  and made up 22% of total EBITDA.\n",
            "[00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:53,700]  Let's hand over to Rosie for the details of the financial numbers.\n",
            "[00:05:53,700 --> 00:06:00,380]  Cash balance at the end of first quarter remained stable from the previous quarter\n",
            "[00:06:00,380 --> 00:06:05,380]  while inventories were up as a result of more smartphone procurement.\n",
            "[00:06:05,380 --> 00:06:10,380]  Next, PP&E at the end of third quarter continued trending down\n",
            "[00:06:10,380 --> 00:06:14,380]  with depreciation and asset write-offs higher than CAPEX.\n",
            "[00:06:14,380 --> 00:06:23,790]  Our growth debt balance fell to $9.36 billion due to $4.6 billion debt repayment in the quarter,\n",
            "[00:06:23,790 --> 00:06:33,790]  which caused net debt to further decline to $3.4 billion NT or just $0.13 or 13% of EBITDA.\n",
            "[00:06:33,790 --> 00:06:38,140]  Now let's look at cash flow analysis.\n",
            "[00:06:38,140 --> 00:06:45,300]  Our operating cash flow for the quarter decreased by $1.6 billion quarter-on-quarter\n",
            "[00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:48,340]  due to a reduction in payables.\n",
            "[00:06:48,340 --> 00:06:56,340]  In addition, a drop in EBITDA also resulted in year-on-year decline in the first quarter operating cash flow.\n",
            "[00:06:56,340 --> 00:07:02,620]  First quarter investing cash outflow was similar to previous levels.\n",
            "[00:07:02,620 --> 00:07:09,620]  Cash CAPEX was on track and accounted for 7% of total revenues in the first quarter.\n",
            "[00:07:09,620 --> 00:07:13,620]  We estimate group CAPEX to be more backend loaded\n",
            "[00:07:13,620 --> 00:07:19,620]  and the total year CAPEX guidance of $6.4 billion to remain unchanged.\n",
            "[00:07:19,620 --> 00:07:25,200]  On the $4.6 billion debt repayment,\n",
            "[00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:35,200]  it was the main cash outflow for financing activities during the quarter.\n",
            "[00:07:36,230 --> 00:07:45,230]  Free cash flow of $4.7 billion generated in the first quarter was equivalent to around 7% annualized yield.\n",
            "[00:07:45,230 --> 00:07:53,450]  On the second quarter guidance, as you may recall,\n",
            "[00:07:53,450 --> 00:08:02,450]  we expect both revenue and EBITDA to trend up sequentially with slightly higher after write-off losses.\n",
            "[00:08:02,450 --> 00:08:09,450]  Our second quarter EPS is estimated to be $1.1 billion,\n",
            "[00:08:09,450 --> 00:08:16,670]  which is equal to that of the first quarter.\n",
            "[00:08:16,670 --> 00:08:24,470]  Let me turn this over to Vivian for event update and key message.\n",
            "[00:08:24,470 --> 00:08:29,470]  CWN4 meeting this morning has approved a proposal\n",
            "[00:08:29,470 --> 00:08:38,470]  to distribute $12.4 billion NT of cash dividends or 90% payout to shareholders.\n",
            "[00:08:38,470 --> 00:08:43,470]  Dividend per share is $4.16 NT per share\n",
            "[00:08:43,470 --> 00:08:51,470]  as our 100% owned affiliates agreed to forfeit their share of dividends from Taiwan Mobile.\n",
            "[00:08:51,470 --> 00:08:56,980]  Some regulatory updates on this page are for your reference.\n",
            "[00:08:56,980 --> 00:09:04,980]  The next page for the new products and services we launched during the first quarter\n",
            "[00:09:04,980 --> 00:09:11,720]  and the awards we recently received is also for your reference.\n",
            "[00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:16,720]  On the last page, to wrap up our presentation,\n",
            "[00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:21,750]  this slide summarizes the key messages that we would like to deliver.\n",
            "[00:09:21,750 --> 00:09:26,750]  Our thrust into smartphone penetration has paid off in the first quarter\n",
            "[00:09:26,750 --> 00:09:32,750]  in helping mitigations of the impact from regulatory invention.\n",
            "[00:09:32,750 --> 00:09:35,750]  Pending approval from the FTC,\n",
            "[00:09:35,750 --> 00:09:38,750]  the MOMO acquisition, as announced,\n",
            "[00:09:38,750 --> 00:09:43,750]  will further support our driver to diversify into other core business.\n",
            "[00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:47,750]  Meanwhile, regulatory uncertainty remains.\n",
            "[00:09:47,750 --> 00:09:53,750]  Taiwan Mobile will set up our efforts to grow non-voice business\n",
            "[00:09:53,750 --> 00:09:58,040]  to enhance shareholder returns.\n",
            "[00:09:58,040 --> 00:10:01,040]  That's all about we would like to say\n",
            "[00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:04,040]  and we would like to open the time for the questions.\n",
            "[00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:05,040]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:10:24,980 --> 00:10:27,980]  Once again, ladies and gentlemen, to register for questions,\n",
            "[00:10:27,980 --> 00:10:36,460]  please press No.1 on your telephone touchpad.\n",
            "[00:10:36,460 --> 00:10:39,460]  Our first question comes from Mr. Alan Lin from BNP Hong Kong.\n",
            "[00:10:39,460 --> 00:10:41,460]  Please go ahead.\n",
            "[00:10:41,460 --> 00:10:43,460]  Hi. Thank you for taking the call.\n",
            "[00:10:43,460 --> 00:10:50,460]  I have a couple of pretty straightforward questions regarding the smartphone portion here.\n",
            "[00:10:50,460 --> 00:10:56,460]  Back to page 5 of your presentation, you talked about the smartphone sales.\n",
            "[00:10:57,460 --> 00:11:03,460]  If you measure from smartphone penetration as a percentage of total subscribers,\n",
            "[00:11:03,460 --> 00:11:06,460]  what percentage are you seeing in Q1\n",
            "[00:11:06,460 --> 00:11:12,460]  and what do you estimate will be in Q2?\n",
            "[00:11:12,460 --> 00:11:14,460]  And then the second part of the question is related to that.\n",
            "[00:11:14,460 --> 00:11:18,460]  Of the 209,000 smartphone handsets sold,\n",
            "[00:11:18,460 --> 00:11:31,310]  what percentage of that is compared to the total handsets sold during the quarter?\n",
            "[00:11:31,310 --> 00:11:36,310]  As regards to the first question, if I recall correctly,\n",
            "[00:11:36,310 --> 00:11:48,160]  our smartphone user penetration rate is roughly maybe between 10% or 15% of the total subscribers.\n",
            "[00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:50,160]  10% to 15%.\n",
            "[00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:51,160]  Right.\n",
            "[00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:52,160]  Okay.\n",
            "[00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:56,160]  And for 200,000 smartphone sales in the first quarter,\n",
            "[00:11:56,160 --> 00:12:03,960]  it's roughly 57% of our total phones that sell.\n",
            "[00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:10,060]  Do you expect 57% to increase further in Q2 or pretty much about the same level?\n",
            "[00:12:10,060 --> 00:12:13,060]  We expect to be roughly the same level\n",
            "[00:12:13,060 --> 00:12:20,060]  because the iPhone has entered to the end of the product life cycle.\n",
            "[00:12:20,060 --> 00:12:23,060]  So people are waiting for the next generation of iPhone.\n",
            "[00:12:23,060 --> 00:12:31,480]  So the iPhone sales will drop off in the second quarter.\n",
            "[00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:35,840]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:36,840]  Thank you once again.\n",
            "[00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:40,060]  Ladies and gentlemen, to register for questions, please press 1.\n",
            "[00:12:40,060 --> 00:12:44,060]  And our next questions come from Mr. Ravi from Citi Group Hong Kong.\n",
            "[00:12:44,060 --> 00:12:45,060]  Please go ahead.\n",
            "[00:12:45,060 --> 00:12:49,160]  Thank you very much for giving us the opportunity to ask questions\n",
            "[00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:51,160]  and congratulations on your results.\n",
            "[00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:57,160]  A quick follow-up on the smartphone answers that you just gave.\n",
            "[00:12:57,160 --> 00:12:58,160]  A couple of questions.\n",
            "[00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:02,160]  The first one is, does your smartphone, the smartphone editions,\n",
            "[00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:05,160]  and the way you define smartphone, does that include Symbian?\n",
            "[00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:11,160]  And if so, what percentage of your current smartphone install base would you say are Symbian?\n",
            "[00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:16,160]  The next question is, of the 57% of ads that come from smartphone,\n",
            "[00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:21,160]  what percent would you say in the period were from the iPhone and from Symbian\n",
            "[00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:23,260]  if they're included in there?\n",
            "[00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:24,260]  Okay.\n",
            "[00:13:24,260 --> 00:13:30,480]  This is a very good question because different operators have different definitions of the smartphone.\n",
            "[00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:38,480]  As far as we are concerned, our definition of smartphone is Symbian 3 and above.\n",
            "[00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:43,480]  So we don't consider Symbian 40 or 50 as smartphone.\n",
            "[00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:51,480]  So when I talk about the penetration rate, it's really Symbian 3, Android, Windows, and iPhone,\n",
            "[00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:53,480]  these kind of platforms.\n",
            "[00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:59,580]  So if you consider Symbian, the penetration rate of smartphone will be even higher.\n",
            "[00:13:59,580 --> 00:14:00,580]  Okay.\n",
            "[00:14:00,580 --> 00:14:07,930]  But our definition will only include Symbian 3 above to be considered a smartphone.\n",
            "[00:14:07,930 --> 00:14:08,930]  Understood.\n",
            "[00:14:08,930 --> 00:14:11,930]  In terms of that Symbian contribution, a quick follow-up,\n",
            "[00:14:11,930 --> 00:14:18,930]  if you were to strip out Symbian completely as much lower usage than the next global average\n",
            "[00:14:18,930 --> 00:14:22,930]  and effectively a dead operating system arguably going forward,\n",
            "[00:14:22,930 --> 00:14:28,930]  what percent of your overall smartphone base would, on that basis,\n",
            "[00:14:28,930 --> 00:14:36,540]  be any of those Symbian that you define as smart?\n",
            "[00:14:36,540 --> 00:14:56,560]  So if we include Symbian, then the Symbian consists of 19% of our install base.\n",
            "[00:14:56,560 --> 00:15:06,380]  So if we consider Symbian as also a smartphone platform,\n",
            "[00:15:06,380 --> 00:15:12,410]  then 90% of our install base, smartphone install base is Symbian.\n",
            "[00:15:12,410 --> 00:15:13,410]  Thank you very much.\n",
            "[00:15:13,410 --> 00:15:14,410]  Understood.\n",
            "[00:15:14,410 --> 00:15:15,410]  Understood.\n",
            "[00:15:15,410 --> 00:15:21,410]  And if you were to strip out the Symbian 3 and above, which you do see as smartphone,\n",
            "[00:15:21,410 --> 00:15:25,410]  what percent would those be on your current definition?\n",
            "[00:15:25,410 --> 00:15:29,410]  What percent of that current definition is the Symbian 3 and above, which you look at as smart?\n",
            "[00:15:29,410 --> 00:15:48,100]  Okay.\n",
            "[00:15:48,100 --> 00:16:00,380]  The 19% of install base that Cliff just mentioned actually is the Symbian 3 and above phones that we refer to.\n",
            "[00:16:00,380 --> 00:16:05,540]  So we did not include all the Symbian phones into the calculation of the smartphone.\n",
            "[00:16:05,540 --> 00:16:06,540]  Understood.\n",
            "[00:16:06,540 --> 00:16:15,180]  So the 10 to 15% doesn't include any of the 19%, which is Symbian?\n",
            "[00:16:16,180 --> 00:16:26,270]  The smartphone penetration does include 19% of smartphone users using Symbian 3 and above.\n",
            "[00:16:26,270 --> 00:16:27,270]  Understood.\n",
            "[00:16:27,270 --> 00:16:28,270]  Thank you very much.\n",
            "[00:16:28,270 --> 00:16:31,800]  Fully understood.\n",
            "[00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:32,800]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:44,880]  Ladies and gentlemen, once again, to register for questions, please press 1.\n",
            "[00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:47,880]  And we have follow-up questions come from Mr. Ravi from Citigroup.\n",
            "[00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:49,880]  Please go ahead.\n",
            "[00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:51,880]  Thank you very much for the opportunity to ask.\n",
            "[00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:54,880]  A couple of quick follow-up questions, if I may.\n",
            "[00:16:54,880 --> 00:17:02,880]  In terms of the average usage in megabits per month for your smart subscribers,\n",
            "[00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:05,880]  I was wondering if you had a feel for what those numbers were at\n",
            "[00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:14,170]  and what was happening to those numbers sequentially, whether they were stable, going up, or coming down.\n",
            "[00:17:14,170 --> 00:17:17,650]  Sequentially?\n",
            "[00:17:17,650 --> 00:17:29,340]  Well, our data usage for smartphones averages about 500 megs.\n",
            "[00:17:29,340 --> 00:17:36,420]  For iPhones, it's about 900 megs.\n",
            "[00:17:36,420 --> 00:17:40,420]  But you are also asking for sequential change, right?\n",
            "[00:17:40,420 --> 00:17:41,420]  Yes, roughly.\n",
            "[00:17:41,420 --> 00:17:44,700]  The trend there that you're seeing.\n",
            "[00:17:44,700 --> 00:17:46,700]  It's going up.\n",
            "[00:17:46,700 --> 00:17:48,800]  It's still going up.\n",
            "[00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:51,630]  Understood.\n",
            "[00:17:51,630 --> 00:17:53,630]  And a quick follow-up, if I may.\n",
            "[00:17:53,630 --> 00:18:00,330]  What percent of your smartphone subs would be iPhone?\n",
            "[00:18:00,330 --> 00:18:04,330]  You mean in terms of total smartphone users?\n",
            "[00:18:04,330 --> 00:18:07,330]  Exactly, yes.\n",
            "[00:18:07,330 --> 00:18:09,330]  In the first quarter or just on average?\n",
            "[00:18:09,330 --> 00:18:10,330]  Total, total.\n",
            "[00:18:10,330 --> 00:18:17,330]  So of the total number of smartphone users you have on your network, what percent will be iPhone?\n",
            "[00:18:17,330 --> 00:18:19,330]  I'm just trying to get a feel for what percent it represents.\n",
            "[00:18:19,330 --> 00:18:22,360]  Let me give you the number.\n",
            "[00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:26,360]  It's about 25%.\n",
            "[00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:27,840]  Thank you very much.\n",
            "[00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:32,780]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:18:32,780 --> 00:18:36,780]  And our next question comes from Joseph from Macquarie, Taiwan.\n",
            "[00:18:36,780 --> 00:18:37,780]  Please go ahead.\n",
            "[00:18:37,780 --> 00:18:39,190]  Thank you very much.\n",
            "[00:18:39,190 --> 00:18:42,190]  I've just got two brief questions.\n",
            "[00:18:42,190 --> 00:18:49,190]  The first one, can you explain a little bit more about where your current lease lines are as a percentage of internally lines?\n",
            "[00:18:49,190 --> 00:18:57,190]  And can you also give us a little bit more color in terms of the fiber-to-base station for your base stations currently?\n",
            "[00:18:57,190 --> 00:19:00,190]  Is that percentage going to increase?\n",
            "[00:19:00,190 --> 00:19:02,190]  What's your targets for year-end?\n",
            "[00:19:02,190 --> 00:19:07,190]  And the final question is on the competition from the data ARPU side.\n",
            "[00:19:07,190 --> 00:19:14,190]  At the moment, it doesn't seem like there's very much competition between data ARPUs, between yourselves, Chungwa, and Farley Stone.\n",
            "[00:19:14,190 --> 00:19:18,190]  I'm just wondering, do you feel anything in particular would trigger this?\n",
            "[00:19:18,190 --> 00:19:25,190]  Would maybe competition from the smaller guys increase this potential for a decrease in data ARPU?\n",
            "[00:19:25,190 --> 00:19:37,830]  To answer your first question on the lease line, our internal lease line now accounts for 83%.\n",
            "[00:19:37,830 --> 00:19:44,830]  And we are still trying hard to improve the ratio as much as we can.\n",
            "[00:19:44,830 --> 00:19:57,050]  And sorry, in terms of those lease lines, do you have a certain percentage of fiber to your base stations at this stage?\n",
            "[00:19:58,050 --> 00:20:01,720]  All of them are fiber.\n",
            "[00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:09,670]  Okay. Thank you.\n",
            "[00:20:09,670 --> 00:20:14,670]  Thank you. And we have follow-up questions come from Mr. Revey from Citigroup Hong Kong. Please go ahead.\n",
            "[00:20:14,670 --> 00:20:20,700]  Thank you very much. Quick question on page 14 on the regulatory update.\n",
            "[00:20:20,700 --> 00:20:30,700]  Clearly, the Executive WAN has already passed, as far as I understand it, the law, the critical law around, you know, which was the block for Cabro.\n",
            "[00:20:30,700 --> 00:20:36,700]  And, you know, interesting in terms of that liberalization of Cat V competition across regions.\n",
            "[00:20:36,700 --> 00:20:46,700]  Do you have any color or feel for, you know, the likely progress and timing of that moving through the legislative WAN going forward?\n",
            "[00:20:46,700 --> 00:20:54,630]  No, we don't have any clues as to the timeline.\n",
            "[00:20:54,630 --> 00:20:58,260]  Understood. Thank you very much.\n",
            "[00:20:58,260 --> 00:21:06,500]  Thank you. And our next follow-up question comes from Mr. Joseph Green from Macaulay, Taiwan. Please go ahead.\n",
            "[00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:12,240]  Sorry, can you just ‚Äì have you got any comments, sorry, on the data output competition?\n",
            "[00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:30,980]  We don't see there will be severe data output competition for this year, because I think APTG or VBO will not pose any threat in the near term, as far as I can see, in this year.\n",
            "[00:21:30,980 --> 00:21:44,980]  So, I think with the current revenue, I think all the operators try to maintain data output, because we see a decrease of voice output.\n",
            "[00:21:44,980 --> 00:21:56,980]  So, and since the data output is our major driver, I don't foresee there will be a serious competition in this arena to further drive down the data output.\n",
            "[00:21:58,580 --> 00:22:10,580]  And just to elaborate a little bit on this issue, as you all know that APT and VBO have been exercising stringent financial discipline,\n",
            "[00:22:10,580 --> 00:22:23,580]  because for APT, they haven't really turned into EVDO, and for VBO, they just don't have the muscle to spend more.\n",
            "[00:22:23,580 --> 00:22:30,580]  So, the competition on this particular front should be rather limited to the big three.\n",
            "[00:22:30,580 --> 00:22:33,580]  And the big three are still quite rational.\n",
            "[00:22:33,580 --> 00:22:35,380]  Okay, thank you.\n",
            "[00:22:35,380 --> 00:22:39,670]  And can I just follow up in terms of the competition between yourselves?\n",
            "[00:22:39,670 --> 00:22:49,670]  When I look at the different packages that's offered between the three of you, it does seem like ‚Äì it does seem that Chonghua tends to be a little bit marginally cheaper.\n",
            "[00:22:49,670 --> 00:22:56,670]  However, what I'm more concerned about is that when you move to higher speed packages, and you maybe offer two different packages,\n",
            "[00:22:56,670 --> 00:23:01,670]  do you think that those packages are offered at a significant premium to the existing rates,\n",
            "[00:23:01,670 --> 00:23:06,670]  or do you have to offer them at what the current rates are and discount back from there?\n",
            "[00:23:06,670 --> 00:23:19,850]  Well, this year, we are considering to launch the 21Met service, HSPA plus service.\n",
            "[00:23:19,850 --> 00:23:24,850]  But we are still waiting for NCC's approval regarding the new tariff.\n",
            "[00:23:24,850 --> 00:23:35,680]  And NCC has different ideas and opinions regarding how much we can charge for this new, more high-speed data service.\n",
            "[00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:41,680]  So, we are still working with NCC to finalize the pricing.\n",
            "[00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:53,800]  So, we don't know whether we can offer a data service pricing significantly higher than the current one.\n",
            "[00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:57,660]  Okay, so on that, that's what I'm more curious of.\n",
            "[00:23:57,660 --> 00:24:06,660]  If you can't offer it higher than the current one, do you offer the current existing package, so the current speeds, do they become cheaper?\n",
            "[00:24:06,660 --> 00:24:08,950]  I don't think so.\n",
            "[00:24:08,950 --> 00:24:10,950]  We are not considering that.\n",
            "[00:24:10,950 --> 00:24:15,960]  Okay, thank you.\n",
            "[00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:16,960]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:19,960]  And our next follow-up question comes from Mr. Ravi from Citigroup Hong Kong.\n",
            "[00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:20,960]  Please go ahead.\n",
            "[00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:21,960]  Thank you very much.\n",
            "[00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:23,960]  Three quick follow-ups, if I may.\n",
            "[00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:30,960]  The first one is, again, toward data pricing, kind of flipping the discussion on its head\n",
            "[00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:41,960]  and looking at this explosion in data usage 50 times to 90 times a voice user for a smartphone in terms of megabits.\n",
            "[00:24:41,960 --> 00:24:47,960]  Do you see on a strategic 12-24 month view the possibility that you'll move from flat rate to tiered pricing,\n",
            "[00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:51,960]  which would imply, of course, a market increase in data pricing?\n",
            "[00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:59,960]  And as an adjunct to that, in terms of the mandatory tariff decreases, would that be doable within the structure of the basket?\n",
            "[00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:06,960]  Second question is, putting together the 19% of your smartphone subs, which come from Simian 3 and above,\n",
            "[00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:12,960]  and 25% with your iPhone, would it be fair to then triangulate, based on the fact that it's too early for Windows Mobile 7\n",
            "[00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:17,960]  and Windows CE was terrible, that 55% roughly are Android?\n",
            "[00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:39,710]  From our point of view, we would like to have a tiering pricing to offer a higher speed mobile Internet service.\n",
            "[00:25:39,710 --> 00:25:46,940]  But as I said, we are still trying to talk with NCC to try to see whether they agree.\n",
            "[00:25:46,940 --> 00:25:56,350]  So, we don't have a timeframe for that because that's really up to NCC.\n",
            "[00:25:56,350 --> 00:26:03,580]  And just on that tiering about speed, what about tiering associated with data usage?\n",
            "[00:26:04,990 --> 00:26:12,250]  This is something that NCC also has its view.\n",
            "[00:26:12,250 --> 00:26:26,050]  Because currently, the package we offer is unlimited and doesn't have any data, doesn't involve how much data involved.\n",
            "[00:26:26,050 --> 00:26:32,050]  So, NCC thinks this is the kind of pricing they would like to have.\n",
            "[00:26:33,050 --> 00:26:43,490]  And the follow-up on the 55% from Android based on the 25% for iPhone and the 19% for Simian.\n",
            "[00:26:43,490 --> 00:26:52,940]  Android now accounts for slightly over 40%.\n",
            "[00:26:52,940 --> 00:26:59,860]  As to the future estimates, Cliff will give you more color on that.\n",
            "[00:26:59,860 --> 00:27:06,730]  I think Android will eventually grow to more than 50%.\n",
            "[00:27:06,730 --> 00:27:09,100]  Agreed.\n",
            "[00:27:10,100 --> 00:27:11,100]  So, just doing the math.\n",
            "[00:27:11,100 --> 00:27:19,100]  So, you've got 19% of your smartphone subs from Simian, 25% from iPhone of your installed base, and 40%.\n",
            "[00:27:19,100 --> 00:27:22,100]  I think I might be missing something on the math.\n",
            "[00:27:23,100 --> 00:27:24,100]  Which is the bit that I'm missing?\n",
            "[00:27:24,100 --> 00:27:30,260]  Because I can't imagine that BlackBerry and Windows make up the balance so much.\n",
            "[00:27:31,810 --> 00:27:32,810]  40, 20.\n",
            "[00:27:32,810 --> 00:27:35,860]  40, 25.\n",
            "[00:27:35,860 --> 00:27:37,860]  Or 50, 25.\n",
            "[00:27:37,860 --> 00:27:38,860]  So, the rest is Windows.\n",
            "[00:27:38,860 --> 00:27:42,860]  Windows Mobile and BlackBerry.\n",
            "[00:27:42,860 --> 00:27:44,860]  Is that high? 15%?\n",
            "[00:27:44,860 --> 00:27:45,860]  Yes.\n",
            "[00:27:45,860 --> 00:27:46,860]  Wow.\n",
            "[00:27:46,860 --> 00:27:50,860]  And that's presumably because it's a bit early for Windows Mobile 7.\n",
            "[00:27:50,860 --> 00:27:51,860]  Windows CE was awful.\n",
            "[00:27:51,860 --> 00:27:54,860]  So, that's lion's share BlackBerry, right?\n",
            "[00:27:54,860 --> 00:27:57,470]  That's really Windows.\n",
            "[00:27:57,470 --> 00:28:07,470]  Because even though Windows 7 is not successful in Taiwan, because up to now they don't have a Chinese version of Windows 7.\n",
            "[00:28:07,470 --> 00:28:13,540]  But Windows Mobile phones do have a significant installed base.\n",
            "[00:28:13,540 --> 00:28:14,540]  Right.\n",
            "[00:28:14,540 --> 00:28:17,540]  They use 6.5 or 6.0.\n",
            "[00:28:17,540 --> 00:28:18,540]  Understood.\n",
            "[00:28:18,540 --> 00:28:19,540]  Understood.\n",
            "[00:28:19,540 --> 00:28:20,540]  Thank you very much.\n",
            "[00:28:21,570 --> 00:28:23,570]  And final question, if I may.\n",
            "[00:28:23,570 --> 00:28:24,570]  And again, a strategic question.\n",
            "[00:28:24,570 --> 00:28:31,600]  Just looking at the trajectory of your numbers, would it be fair to say that on a run rate basis,\n",
            "[00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:36,600]  by the end of this year, say the fourth quarter slash first quarter of next year,\n",
            "[00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:47,240]  the incremental data ARPUs that we're seeing fully offset, not only offset declines in voice,\n",
            "[00:28:47,240 --> 00:28:51,240]  but also offset the incremental burden of handset subsidies?\n",
            "[00:28:51,240 --> 00:28:53,240]  Or would that be more like a little bit later?\n",
            "[00:28:53,240 --> 00:28:55,100]  Sure.\n",
            "[00:28:55,100 --> 00:29:10,100]  According to our estimates, the revenues from our data growth will outnumber or make up for the decline in voice revenues.\n",
            "[00:29:10,100 --> 00:29:13,330]  So, that's our expectation.\n",
            "[00:29:13,330 --> 00:29:20,330]  And probably next financial year when it also makes up for the increased investment in handset subsidies and the drag there.\n",
            "[00:29:20,330 --> 00:29:23,280]  Yes.\n",
            "[00:29:23,280 --> 00:29:24,280]  Very interesting.\n",
            "[00:29:24,280 --> 00:29:27,360]  Thank you very much.\n",
            "[00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:28,360]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:29:28,360 --> 00:29:36,420]  Ladies and gentlemen, to register for a question, please press 1.\n",
            "[00:29:36,420 --> 00:29:40,420]  There's enough follow-up questions come from Mr. Raffey from CDI Hong Kong.\n",
            "[00:29:40,420 --> 00:29:41,420]  Please go ahead.\n",
            "[00:29:41,420 --> 00:29:42,420]  Final question.\n",
            "[00:29:42,420 --> 00:29:45,420]  Don't want to overstay my welcome with too many questions on the call.\n",
            "[00:29:45,420 --> 00:29:53,420]  But in terms of early stage data points for tablet usage, I know it's been pretty much a one-horse race thus far.\n",
            "[00:29:53,420 --> 00:29:57,420]  But we're probably going to see, as of the Consumer Electronics Show last year,\n",
            "[00:29:57,420 --> 00:30:05,520]  the next phase being a whole plethora of tablets in different flavors at the second generation.\n",
            "[00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:12,770]  Any early data points in terms of tablet usage in megabits per month terms?\n",
            "[00:30:12,770 --> 00:30:14,770]  1.5 giga.\n",

            "[00:30:31,690 --> 00:30:35,690]  And presumably that's the lion's share of that is iPad right now, right?\n",
            "[00:30:35,690 --> 00:30:43,870]  Yes, because the install base is mostly iPad 1.\n",

            "[00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:29,540]  And you will see that on the outline that we're going to talk about the first quarter,\n",

            "[00:01:49,540 --> 00:01:53,600]  and then update as well as our key message.\n",
            "[00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:58,600]  As you go to the result summary page, which is page four,\n",
            "[00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:06,600]  you can see that for first quarter this year, our total revenue is $17 billion,\n",
            "[00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:13,890]  which is on target with our guidance.\n",
            "[00:02:13,890 --> 00:02:17,890]  Although the cost of the handset sales came in higher than the guidance,\n",
            "[00:02:17,890 --> 00:02:26,890]  we managed to meet our operating income through operating expense control.\n",
            "[00:02:26,890 --> 00:02:31,890]  In addition to a stable EBITDA in first quarter this year,\n",
            "[00:02:31,890 --> 00:02:36,890]  the 50% year-over-year reduction in non-operating expense,\n",
            "[00:02:36,890 --> 00:02:41,890]  including lower asset write-off losses as well as interest expense,\n",
            "[00:02:41,890 --> 00:02:53,070]  lower income tax, these all contributed to the 11% year-over-year growth on net income.\n",
            "[00:02:53,070 --> 00:03:01,070]  If you go to the next page, we are now looking at the first quarter performance breakdown\n",
            "[00:03:01,070 --> 00:03:04,070]  by the three business groups.\n",
            "[00:03:04,070 --> 00:03:08,070]  And on the consumer business group,\n",
            "[00:03:08,070 --> 00:03:18,230]  you can see that the CBG's first quarter EBITDA was negatively affected by our step-up effort\n",
            "[00:03:18,230 --> 00:03:28,230]  in selling more 3G smart devices as well as our data plans to our customers.\n",
            "[00:03:28,230 --> 00:03:36,230]  In return, we see real 3G data revenue going up 15% quarter-over-quarter basis\n",
            "[00:03:36,230 --> 00:03:40,520]  at the end of March this year.\n",
            "[00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:48,520]  On the household business, our HBG revenue has been benefiting from larger subscriber base\n",
            "[00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:53,520]  and higher speed broadband service adoption.\n",
            "[00:03:53,520 --> 00:04:02,190]  This coupled with better economy of scale has increased its first quarter EBITDA by 13%\n",
            "[00:04:02,190 --> 00:04:05,820]  on a year-over-year basis.\n",
            "[00:04:05,820 --> 00:04:12,820]  On the enterprise business group, our EBG business group that continues reporting\n",
            "[00:04:12,820 --> 00:04:15,820]  a year-over-year increase in EBITDA for the quarter,\n",
            "[00:04:15,820 --> 00:04:21,820]  this is primarily backed up by higher low-income revenue\n",
            "[00:04:21,820 --> 00:04:25,820]  as well as well-controlled operating expenses.\n",
            "[00:04:25,820 --> 00:04:31,040]  Let's go to the next page,\n",
            "[00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:40,040]  which will give you some comparison among the wireless operators.\n",
            "[00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:48,040]  As you can see from the chart that our mobile service revenue on a year-over-year basis\n",
            "[00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:52,040]  declined and continued to taper off this quarter.\n",
            "[00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:57,040]  So now we are down to less than 1% decline.\n",
            "[00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:03,040]  This is primarily attributed to improved revenue per minute\n",
            "[00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:10,200]  due to we have reduced the low-yield event.\n",
            "[00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:15,300]  Also coupled with good growth momentum in very early services,\n",
            "[00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:27,700]  our ARPA will now stand out among our peers this quarter.\n",
            "[00:05:27,700 --> 00:05:34,700]  Let's further look at our value-added services as well as our 3G adopters.\n",
            "[00:05:34,700 --> 00:05:40,700]  Our value-added service revenue continues double-digit growth on a year-over-year basis\n",
            "[00:05:40,700 --> 00:05:50,730]  this quarter and has accounted now for 14.2% of our total service revenue.\n",
            "[00:05:50,730 --> 00:05:56,730]  It is worth noticing that the revenue from mobile Internet\n",
            "[00:05:56,730 --> 00:06:04,760]  now has accounted for close to half of our best revenue\n",
            "[00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:08,760]  and it is expected that it will further grow\n",
            "[00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:13,500]  along with the increased popularity of a smart device.\n",
            "[00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:19,590]  Our 3G post-paid subscriber number in the first quarter\n",
            "[00:06:19,590 --> 00:06:25,590]  has exceeded three and a half million, up 39% on a year-over-year basis,\n",
            "[00:06:25,590 --> 00:06:31,590]  which made up 61% of total post-paid subscriber base.\n",
            "[00:06:31,590 --> 00:06:43,520]  And our 3G data revenue was up 71% from a year ago.\n",
            "[00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:48,470]  Now I will ask Rosy to talk about our bank.\n",
            "[00:06:48,470 --> 00:06:49,470]  Good afternoon.\n",
            "[00:06:49,470 --> 00:06:53,470]  Let me talk you through cash flow analysis first.\n",
            "[00:06:53,470 --> 00:06:59,470]  Our operating cash flow remains stable in the first quarter of this year.\n",
            "[00:06:59,470 --> 00:07:08,470]  The first quarter investment activity cash outlay was mainly for the $1.46 billion in cash capex.\n",
            "[00:07:08,470 --> 00:07:15,470]  On the financing front, we repaid altogether $6.45 billion in short-term debt,\n",
            "[00:07:16,470 --> 00:07:20,470]  including $5.65 billion of short-term borrowings\n",
            "[00:07:20,470 --> 00:07:24,470]  and $0.8 billion of commercial paper.\n",
            "[00:07:24,470 --> 00:07:29,470]  With good core business cash earnings and stable cash capex,\n",
            "[00:07:29,470 --> 00:07:34,470]  our first quarter free cash flow of $6.44 billion\n",
            "[00:07:34,470 --> 00:07:41,470]  translated into an improved annualized free cash flow yield of 11.3%.\n",
            "[00:07:41,470 --> 00:07:46,760]  Now let's turn to page 9 for our balance sheet numbers.\n",
            "[00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:55,860]  On the SSI, cash balance remains stable and net PP&E balance at the end of first quarter\n",
            "[00:07:55,860 --> 00:08:02,890]  was down sequentially with depreciation and asset write-off higher than capex.\n",
            "[00:08:02,890 --> 00:08:06,890]  The 2G net book value was reduced to $16 billion\n",
            "[00:08:06,890 --> 00:08:13,750]  and 3G was down to $12.5 billion at the end of the first quarter.\n",
            "[00:08:13,750 --> 00:08:17,750]  Sorry, 3G.\n",
            "[00:08:17,750 --> 00:08:26,750]  So with a $6.45 billion reduction in borrowings in the quarter,\n",
            "[00:08:26,750 --> 00:08:29,750]  as mentioned in the cash flow analysis,\n",
            "[00:08:30,750 --> 00:08:38,750]  our growth debt dropped to $9.15 billion, net debt to $6.19 billion respectively.\n",
            "[00:08:38,750 --> 00:08:46,750]  So that's pushing down our net debt to EBITDA to $0.03 times at the end of first quarter.\n",
            "[00:08:46,750 --> 00:08:53,130]  Let me turn this over to Harvey for second quarter guidance.\n",
            "[00:08:53,130 --> 00:09:03,140]  As we look at the forecast for the second quarter,\n",
            "[00:09:03,140 --> 00:09:13,520]  starting April we will be facing this mandatory mobile price cut\n",
            "[00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:25,550]  which will result in a negative revenue impact of roughly $315 million for the second quarter.\n",
            "[00:09:25,550 --> 00:09:34,280]  We plan to reduce our SG&A expense in second quarter by 9% on a year-over-year basis\n",
            "[00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:41,280]  or $80,324 to mitigate the negative revenue impact from the tariff cut.\n",
            "[00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:48,630]  Separately, we are also optimistic about our mobile data revenue growth\n",
            "[00:09:48,630 --> 00:09:53,630]  and forecast more than 20% year-over-year growth in second quarter.\n",
            "[00:09:53,630 --> 00:10:00,750]  Nevertheless, our strategy of leveling up the smart device take-up\n",
            "[00:10:00,750 --> 00:10:06,360]  will lead to a year-over-year increase in asset sales costs in second quarter.\n",
            "[00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:10,360]  Therefore, our second quarter EBITDA is expected to be down\n",
            "[00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:16,450]  both quarter-over-quarter as well as year-over-year basis.\n",
            "[00:10:16,450 --> 00:10:22,610]  Non-op expense in second quarter is estimated to be $329 million,\n",
            "[00:10:22,610 --> 00:10:30,280]  down 16% on year-over-year basis with less asset write-off loss expense than a year ago.\n",
            "[00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:44,760]  Our EBITDA share in second quarter is estimated to be around $1.04.\n",
            "[00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:52,370]  And then let me talk about the next page, which is the dividend proposal.\n",
            "[00:10:52,370 --> 00:11:04,460]  The board has approved the proposal to disburse $15 billion in cash dividends\n",
            "[00:11:04,460 --> 00:11:06,460]  to the shareholders.\n",
            "[00:11:06,460 --> 00:11:19,500]  This will translate into $5.03 per share based on 2,989 million shares outstanding,\n",
            "[00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:31,960]  which means that all the shares held by our subsidiaries will not claim any cash dividends.\n",
            "[00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:37,960]  So that portion is also distributed to the remaining shareholders.\n",
            "[00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:45,720]  So it goes up to $5.03 per share.\n",
            "[00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:52,520]  The next page is some updates on the regulatory events.\n",
            "[00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:56,550]  I think I will not bother you with that.\n",
            "[00:11:56,550 --> 00:12:01,380]  You can read it when you have the time.\n",
            "[00:12:01,380 --> 00:12:08,380]  Our key message for this quarter is that the mandatory price cut has phased in\n",
            "[00:12:08,380 --> 00:12:11,740]  to affect our second-quarter earnings.\n",
            "[00:12:11,740 --> 00:12:18,740]  GIA expense savings are expected to mitigate the impact to a certain extent.\n",
            "[00:12:18,740 --> 00:12:23,740]  With our step-up efforts in data, more resources will be deployed\n",
            "[00:12:23,740 --> 00:12:27,740]  to beef up the intake upgrade to ensure growth.\n",
            "[00:12:27,740 --> 00:12:32,740]  We expect to see these efforts pay off over the medium term.\n",
            "[00:12:32,740 --> 00:12:37,740]  I think that has wrapped up my presentation.\n",
            "[00:12:37,740 --> 00:12:43,240]  And we'll be happy to move on to the next page.\n",
            "[00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:47,850]  But I think there are also some related challenges.\n",
            "[00:12:47,850 --> 00:12:54,080]  We'll be happy to take questions.\n",
            "[00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:55,080]  Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.\n",
            "[00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:57,080]  We will now open for questions.\n",
            "[00:12:57,080 --> 00:13:07,580]  If you'd like to register for a question, please press number 1.\n",
            "[00:13:07,580 --> 00:13:10,580]  Our first question comes from Kathy Kim from Goldman Sachs.\n",
            "[00:13:10,580 --> 00:13:11,580]  Please go ahead.\n",
            "[00:13:11,580 --> 00:13:12,580]  Hi.\n",
            "[00:13:12,580 --> 00:13:13,580]  Thanks for taking my question.\n",
            "[00:13:13,580 --> 00:13:15,580]  I'd like to start with three questions.\n",
            "[00:13:15,580 --> 00:13:19,580]  The first one is on the second-quarter EBITDA guidance.\n",
            "[00:13:19,580 --> 00:13:24,580]  It looks like you expect to reduce SG&A by enough to fully offset the negative\n",
            "[00:13:24,580 --> 00:13:26,580]  mobile revenue impact and the price cut.\n",
            "[00:13:26,580 --> 00:13:30,580]  And on top of that, you mentioned that you expect mobile data revenues to grow\n",
            "[00:13:30,580 --> 00:13:32,580]  about 20% year-on-year.\n",
            "[00:13:32,580 --> 00:13:36,580]  So that looks like it should add about $330 million to your revenues.\n",
            "[00:13:36,580 --> 00:13:39,580]  And then your cable business is also growing EBITDA.\n",
            "[00:13:39,580 --> 00:13:41,580]  I think it should be relatively stable.\n",
            "[00:13:41,580 --> 00:13:46,580]  So can you just explain to us why you expect EBITDA to fall by $870 million\n",
            "[00:13:46,580 --> 00:13:48,580]  year-on-year?\n",
            "[00:13:48,580 --> 00:13:52,670]  How much of this is attributable to the handset subsidies increasing?\n",
            "[00:13:52,670 --> 00:13:55,670]  And I have just two questions on the cable side.\n",
            "[00:13:56,900 --> 00:14:00,900]  On the EBITDA number for the second quarter,\n",
            "[00:14:00,900 --> 00:14:05,900]  the impact is all from handset subsidies,\n",
            "[00:14:05,900 --> 00:14:15,570]  as you can figure out later from the fact sheet we will release later.\n",
            "[00:14:15,570 --> 00:14:22,570]  But basically, you know we will have $324 million savings in SG&A,\n",
            "[00:14:22,570 --> 00:14:30,570]  and we will have some impact, $315 million impact from the mandatory price cut\n",
            "[00:14:30,570 --> 00:14:35,570]  and an increase of about $0.7 billion in handset subsidies.\n",
            "[00:14:35,570 --> 00:14:40,570]  That's roughly the number for the decrease in EBITDA.\n",
            "[00:14:40,570 --> 00:14:45,930]  Okay, thanks.\n",
            "[00:14:45,930 --> 00:14:49,930]  And then I just have two questions on the cable deal.\n",
            "[00:14:49,930 --> 00:14:55,930]  Can you give us an update on how you're doing with the government ownership issue,\n",
            "[00:14:55,930 --> 00:14:59,930]  and can you give us any estimate on when you expect the deal to close by?\n",
            "[00:14:59,930 --> 00:15:03,930]  And then secondly, related to this completion date,\n",
            "[00:15:03,930 --> 00:15:06,930]  if the deal doesn't close by the ex-dividend date in July,\n",
            "[00:15:06,930 --> 00:15:11,930]  does that mean that all of the Treasury shares will forego dividends\n",
            "[00:15:11,930 --> 00:15:16,110]  so that the remaining shareholders get more cash?\n",
            "[00:15:16,110 --> 00:15:21,110]  As you can see, we have already foregone all the Treasury shares dividends.\n",
            "[00:15:21,110 --> 00:15:25,110]  So whether this deal goes through or not,\n",
            "[00:15:25,110 --> 00:15:32,980]  I think the shares they get will not be paid the dividends.\n",
            "[00:15:32,980 --> 00:15:36,480]  Okay, understood.\n",
            "[00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:39,480]  As to the status of it,\n",
            "[00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:47,480]  basically we are still wrestling with the regulators.\n",
            "[00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:50,480]  It's a tough one.\n",
            "[00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:57,620]  So it's not exactly in our control.\n",
            "[00:15:57,620 --> 00:15:59,620]  So we will have to wait and see.\n",
            "[00:15:59,620 --> 00:16:10,520]  Okay, thanks.\n",
            "[00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:11,520]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:14,520]  Next question comes from Lise Neslin from CLSA Hong Kong.\n",
            "[00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:16,810]  Please go ahead.\n",
            "[00:16:16,810 --> 00:16:17,810]  Hi, guys.\n",
            "[00:16:17,810 --> 00:16:18,810]  Thanks very much for the call.\n",
            "[00:16:18,810 --> 00:16:20,810]  I have one question.\n",
            "[00:16:20,810 --> 00:16:26,810]  On the slide where you mentioned some of the regulatory changes that are in the works\n",
            "[00:16:26,810 --> 00:16:30,810]  and one specifically relating to cable TV operators\n",
            "[00:16:30,810 --> 00:16:33,810]  being allowed to branch out into other service areas,\n",
            "[00:16:33,810 --> 00:16:37,810]  I'm just wondering if you can elaborate a bit more on what this is\n",
            "[00:16:37,810 --> 00:16:39,810]  and what does that mean?\n",
            "[00:16:39,810 --> 00:16:43,810]  Essentially, you have cable TV operators competing in different parts of Taiwan\n",
            "[00:16:43,810 --> 00:16:46,810]  as opposed to how it was before, more of a geographic monopoly.\n",
            "[00:16:46,810 --> 00:16:52,810]  If that goes through, what sort of impact you could see for your own Taiwan fixed network\n",
            "[00:16:52,810 --> 00:17:00,020]  and even Canberra when you are hopefully allowed to finally acquire it?\n",
            "[00:17:00,020 --> 00:17:10,110]  I think this is something that is ongoing within NCC right now.\n",
            "[00:17:10,110 --> 00:17:17,100]  Still, I think there are quite a few steps they have to take.\n",
            "[00:17:17,100 --> 00:17:25,100]  What they are proposing is right now the island is divided into 50-plus operating zones.\n",
            "[00:17:25,100 --> 00:17:34,320]  They want to reduce that number from 51 to actually I think they have several different versions.\n",
            "[00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:40,420]  Most likely scenario is something like 20-plus.\n",
            "[00:17:41,420 --> 00:17:48,420]  I think the operating region will be expanded a little bit.\n",
            "[00:17:48,420 --> 00:17:58,580]  To the existing operators, I think it might mean some stress,\n",
            "[00:17:58,580 --> 00:18:02,280]  but it also might mean some opportunity as well.\n",
            "[00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:09,660]  Unless they are reducing from 50-some to 20-some,\n",
            "[00:18:09,660 --> 00:18:14,890]  of course, you are combining two or three operating regions into one.\n",
            "[00:18:14,890 --> 00:18:28,970]  If you already have license, I think maybe you are facing a bit more both stress as well as opportunities.\n",
            "[00:18:28,970 --> 00:18:35,050]  This is something that we are keeping our eye on.\n",
            "[00:18:35,050 --> 00:18:40,850]  We still need to see exactly how it plays out.\n",
            "[00:18:40,850 --> 00:18:44,140]  Okay, great. Thank you very much for that.\n",
            "[00:18:44,140 --> 00:18:47,060]  Thank you. Once again, ladies and gentlemen,\n",
            "[00:18:47,060 --> 00:18:50,060]  if you would like to register for a question, please press the number 1 key now.\n",
            "[00:18:50,060 --> 00:18:51,060]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:18:51,060 --> 00:18:56,270]  Next question comes from Henry Cole from Lefky, London.\n",
            "[00:18:56,270 --> 00:18:58,560]  Please go ahead.\n",
            "[00:18:58,560 --> 00:19:00,560]  Hi there. Thanks very much for the call.\n",
            "[00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:10,680]  Could you possibly provide an update on where the financials closed for KBRO in 2009, the full-year numbers?\n",
            "[00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:12,680]  KBRO numbers?\n",
            "[00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:16,680]  Yes, KBRO, the target acquisition.\n",
            "[00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:22,480]  We don't have their final numbers yet.\n",
            "[00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:26,480]  Okay. I missed the earlier part of the call.\n",
            "[00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:32,480]  Did you give any comment on the timing of the deal and what needs to clear beforehand?\n",
            "[00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:36,930]  No.\n",
            "[00:19:36,930 --> 00:19:42,580]  The statement we made on timing is still uncertain.\n",
            "[00:19:42,580 --> 00:19:44,580]  But in the absence of a conclusion to the deal,\n",
            "[00:19:44,580 --> 00:19:54,580]  we can assume that the dividend policy remains the same in terms of the payout to eligible shareholders?\n",
            "[00:19:54,580 --> 00:19:56,580]  Yes.\n",
            "[00:19:56,580 --> 00:20:05,810]  Actually, after today, the dividend for the year 2009 is already fixed.\n",
            "[00:20:05,810 --> 00:20:09,100]  No event will change that.\n",
            "[00:20:09,100 --> 00:20:18,280]  So you will be getting a definite amount of $5.03 per share.\n",
            "[00:20:18,280 --> 00:20:19,280]  Okay.\n",
            "[00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:24,280]  And very lastly, once the KBRO deal is concluded,\n",
            "[00:20:24,280 --> 00:20:28,280]  would you then review your additional capital management options?\n",
            "[00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:32,210]  Yes, of course, we will.\n",
            "[00:20:32,210 --> 00:20:44,520]  But there are a lot of things that we need to deal with upon closing the deal.\n",
            "[00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:48,520]  And we also have to look at our cash position.\n",
            "[00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:53,520]  It might change a little bit because KBRO does bear a lot of debt in balance.\n",
            "[00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:54,520]  Yes.\n",
            "[00:20:55,740 --> 00:20:56,740]  Okay.\n",
            "[00:20:56,740 --> 00:21:01,740]  And the $300 million revenue adjustment that you've forecast for second quarter,\n",
            "[00:21:01,740 --> 00:21:10,780]  is that to reflect the full year impact of the tariff change or is it just for those three months?\n",
            "[00:21:10,780 --> 00:21:13,000]  It's for those three months.\n",
            "[00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,000]  Okay.\n",
            "[00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000]  And how did you get to that number?\n",
            "[00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000]  Isn't it just a 5% tariff cut?\n",
            "[00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:21,310]  Yes.\n",
            "[00:21:21,310 --> 00:21:22,310]  Okay.\n",
            "[00:21:22,310 --> 00:21:25,660]  So that's 5% of your quarterly revenues?\n",
            "[00:21:25,660 --> 00:21:31,660]  Yes, that's based on the mandatory price cut that we came up with,\n",
            "[00:21:31,660 --> 00:21:35,660]  this $315 million impact on a quarterly basis.\n",
            "[00:21:35,660 --> 00:21:36,820]  Okay.\n",
            "[00:21:36,820 --> 00:21:43,180]  So you're not forecasting any elasticity adjustment?\n",
            "[00:21:43,180 --> 00:21:47,190]  No.\n",
            "[00:21:47,190 --> 00:21:49,610]  Okay.\n",
            "[00:21:49,610 --> 00:21:51,610]  That's great.\n",
            "[00:21:51,610 --> 00:21:52,610]  All right.\n",
            "[00:21:52,610 --> 00:22:04,050]  Thank you very much indeed.\n",
            "[00:22:04,050 --> 00:22:05,050]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:22:05,050 --> 00:22:08,050]  We have one follow-up question from Dee of CLSA in Hong Kong.\n",
            "[00:22:08,050 --> 00:22:09,050]  Please go ahead.\n",
            "[00:22:09,050 --> 00:22:10,050]  Hi, guys.\n",
            "[00:22:10,050 --> 00:22:13,050]  Sorry, just one follow-up question, again, pertaining to cable.\n",
            "[00:22:13,050 --> 00:22:18,050]  It looks like you've done a pretty good job in terms of migrating cable TV subscribers\n",
            "[00:22:18,050 --> 00:22:20,050]  to also taking cable broadband.\n",
            "[00:22:20,050 --> 00:22:25,050]  The percentage has gone up to taking cable broadband, 22% now.\n",
            "[00:22:25,050 --> 00:22:29,050]  I'm just wondering, are you guys more focused on bundling these two services together?\n",
            "[00:22:29,050 --> 00:22:35,050]  What's driving this in terms of the continual take-up of cable broadband?\n",
            "[00:22:35,050 --> 00:22:37,050]  And where do you see that going to?\n",
            "[00:22:37,050 --> 00:22:42,050]  Do you have any forecast into the next few years as to how that percentage of cable TV subscribers\n",
            "[00:22:42,050 --> 00:22:46,720]  also taking cable broadband can go to?\n",
            "[00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:56,010]  We are bundling primarily the digital TV service together with the broadband service\n",

            "[00:06:53,210 --> 00:07:02,210]  Separately, the cable internet growth will continue to propel HPG's revenue in this third quarter this year.\n",
            "[00:07:02,210 --> 00:07:10,840]  Our expectations of higher enterprise-related mobile revenue will also contribute to the revenue growth.\n",
            "[00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:14,840]  To cope with the pressure on mobile voice revenue,\n",
            "[00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:20,840]  we will continue lowering our network cost and administrative-related expenses\n",

            "[00:07:48,530 --> 00:07:56,660]  our third quarter write-off losses will taper off to NT$287 million only.\n",
            "[00:07:56,660 --> 00:08:03,460]  This coupled with the lower tax rate will translate into a positive net profit increase\n",
            "[00:08:03,460 --> 00:08:08,490]  both on quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year basis.\n",

            "[00:09:26,420 --> 00:09:29,420]  The first one is on the cable business.\n",
            "[00:09:29,420 --> 00:09:35,420]  Given the recent news flow that the Tsai family may use its own vehicle to acquire Cabro,\n",
            "[00:09:35,420 --> 00:09:42,420]  could you share how Tao Mobile would be able to cooperate with Cabro in the future from an operational standpoint?\n",
            "[00:09:42,420 --> 00:09:48,420]  Also, can you confirm whether Tao Mobile will be providing any funding to the Tsai family entity?\n",
            "[00:09:48,420 --> 00:09:54,420]  The second question is on, I just wanted to clarify whether the government ownership restrictions on media assets\n",
            "[00:09:54,420 --> 00:09:58,420]  will impact Tao Mobile's current holding on TFN.\n",
            "[00:09:58,420 --> 00:10:02,420]  And then the last question is on the third quarter guidance.\n",
            "[00:10:02,420 --> 00:10:13,200]  Can you provide some more color on why you expect EBITDA margins to decline two percentage points quarter on quarter?\n",
            "[00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:23,200]  Kathy, there won't be any impact on your second question on our current holding of TFN media assets.\n",
            "[00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:42,960]  And we have already issued a press release yesterday that there's no funding.\n",
            "[00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:51,580]  Let's do your first question from the point of view of what we have.\n",
            "[00:10:51,580 --> 00:11:09,420]  As you know, we are the fourth largest cable TV operator.\n",
            "[00:11:09,420 --> 00:11:25,480]  A little over 100,000 broadband users continue that we want to provide.\n",
            "[00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:45,000]  Of course, at this point of time, limited coverage at this service.\n",
            "[00:11:51,540 --> 00:11:59,840]  Rosie, can you talk about that?\n",
            "[00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:04,640]  Our quarter on quarter basis will be down two percent.\n",
            "[00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:15,230]  That's mainly due to the increased cancer subsidies expected for the third quarter.\n",
            "[00:12:15,230 --> 00:12:17,230]  Okay, thanks.\n",
            "[00:12:17,230 --> 00:12:19,230]  Can I just follow up on the first question?\n",
            "[00:12:19,230 --> 00:12:27,650]  So is there anything you could share regarding cooperation with Cabro in the future then?\n",
            "[00:12:27,650 --> 00:12:33,020]  Right now, I think they have just signed an agreement.\n",
            "[00:12:33,020 --> 00:12:39,370]  The deal is not even coming.\n",
            "[00:12:39,370 --> 00:12:40,370]  Okay, thank you.\n",
            "[00:12:40,370 --> 00:12:43,130]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:12:43,130 --> 00:12:47,130]  Once again, ladies and gentlemen, if you'd like to register for a question, please press the number one key now.\n",
            "[00:12:47,130 --> 00:12:48,130]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:12:48,130 --> 00:12:53,080]  Our next question comes from Harry Chan of Credit Suisse.\n",
            "[00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:54,080]  Please go ahead.\n",
            "[00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:55,080]  Hi, thank you for the call.\n",
            "[00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:57,080]  I have one question.\n",
            "[00:12:58,080 --> 00:13:02,080]  Given that Tower Mobile is no longer pursuing the Cabro deal,\n",
            "[00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:10,900]  should we continue to assume the Treasury share will continue to give up the dividend?\n",
            "[00:13:10,900 --> 00:13:24,360]  Yeah, as long as the Treasury share is there, then I think we will give up.\n",
            "[00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:25,360]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:30,120]  Once again, ladies and gentlemen, that is the number one key for questions.\n",
            "[00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:33,120]  Our next question comes from Lee Peng Hwan of Nomura Hong Kong.\n",
            "[00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:39,910]  Please go ahead.\n",
            "[00:13:39,910 --> 00:13:41,900]  Hello.\n",
            "[00:13:41,900 --> 00:13:44,900]  Once again, our next question comes from Lee Peng Hwan of Nomura.\n",
            "[00:13:44,900 --> 00:13:45,900]  Please go ahead.\n",
            "[00:13:45,900 --> 00:13:52,540]  Peng Hwan, are you there?\n",
            "[00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:55,540]  We'll hold the next question once again.\n",
            "[00:13:55,540 --> 00:13:58,540]  Once again, ladies and gentlemen, if you'd like to register for a question,\n",
            "[00:13:58,540 --> 00:14:00,540]  please press the number one key now.\n",
            "[00:14:00,540 --> 00:14:04,970]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:14:04,970 --> 00:14:07,970]  Our next question comes from Martin Lo of Taiwan Hong Kong.\n",
            "[00:14:07,970 --> 00:14:08,970]  Please go ahead.\n",
            "[00:14:08,970 --> 00:14:11,190]  Hi, I just have a quick question.\n",
            "[00:14:11,190 --> 00:14:18,190]  Is there a possibility that the Tsai family would actually sell any of their stakes in Taiwan Mobile\n",
            "[00:14:18,190 --> 00:14:21,190]  to fund the acquisition of the Cabro?\n",
            "[00:14:21,190 --> 00:14:29,690]  Well, I really cannot speak for them, but I really don't see their behavior.\n",
            "[00:14:29,690 --> 00:14:31,690]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:14:31,690 --> 00:14:32,690]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:14:32,690 --> 00:14:38,790]  Once again, ladies and gentlemen, that is the number one key for questions.\n",
            "[00:14:38,790 --> 00:14:43,980]  Our next question comes from Joseph Queen of Macquarie Hong Kong of Taiwan.\n",
            "[00:14:43,980 --> 00:14:44,980]  Please go ahead.\n",
            "[00:14:44,980 --> 00:14:45,980]  Thanks, guys.\n",
            "[00:14:45,980 --> 00:14:47,200]  Thanks, guys.\n",
            "[00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:48,200]  Just a quick question.\n",
            "[00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:56,200]  Can you give us some further color on why you believe your EBITDA margin is performing better than Far Eastone?\n",
            "[00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:59,200]  Are they more aggressive on their smartphone strategy?\n",
            "[00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:02,200]  Or have you any other comments on why that is?\n",
            "[00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:06,830]  Well, let me put it this way.\n",
            "[00:15:06,830 --> 00:15:09,830]  We don't believe in buying revenues.\n",
            "[00:15:09,830 --> 00:15:15,650]  So we believe that our EBITDA is worse than others.\n",
            "[00:15:15,650 --> 00:15:21,300]  We just don't believe it.\n",
            "[00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:31,100]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:34,100]  Our next question comes from Lepin Wan of Namur.\n",
            "[00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:35,100]  Please go ahead.\n",
            "[00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:36,100]  Hello, can you hear me?\n",
            "[00:15:36,100 --> 00:15:37,100]  Yes.\n",
            "[00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:38,100]  Sorry.\n",
            "[00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:40,100]  Thank you for the call today.\n",
            "[00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:43,100]  Can you explain more about this?\n",
            "[00:15:43,100 --> 00:15:46,100]  What is the current situation of your smartphone?\n",
            "[00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:52,100]  I mean, how many penetration rate of the contract today on the stock base?\n",
            "[00:15:52,100 --> 00:15:55,100]  How many smartphones are there in your network?\n",
            "[00:15:55,100 --> 00:16:01,100]  And what is the impact for your CapEx for the second half or next year?\n",
            "[00:16:01,100 --> 00:16:06,580]  Is it because we see in U.S. the CapEx really rising?\n",
            "[00:16:06,580 --> 00:16:15,580]  Smart device users now account for close to 5% of our total subscriber base.\n",
            "[00:16:15,580 --> 00:16:24,050]  And our strategy is to grow to about 10%.\n",
            "[00:16:25,050 --> 00:16:31,650]  It does not create a burden on our network.\n",
            "[00:16:31,650 --> 00:16:49,610]  And this is ‚Äì and there are ‚Äì so that's why I'm for this smartphone penetration on our end.\n",
            "[00:16:49,610 --> 00:16:58,130]  So the second question is about this cable business.\n",
            "[00:16:58,130 --> 00:17:00,130]  I mean, the cable things.\n",
            "[00:17:00,130 --> 00:17:12,290]  Can you comment that are there any change of this cable TV industry in Taiwan after this cable acquisition happens?\n",
            "[00:17:12,290 --> 00:17:19,070]  Or to your business, I mean to your own business.\n",
            "[00:17:25,810 --> 00:17:29,810]  I don't really anticipate any dramatic change right after this.\n",
            "[00:17:29,810 --> 00:17:34,040]  It will be a little bit different.\n",
            "[00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:48,300]  The last question is that because the cable ‚Äì your original plan to acquire cable does not go through.\n",
            "[00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:53,300]  So do you think your cash position will improve from now on?\n",
            "[00:17:53,300 --> 00:18:01,300]  So do you think you will consider more capital reductions or this capital management policy more positively?\n",
            "[00:18:01,300 --> 00:18:04,620]  No, I don't think so.\n",
            "[00:18:04,620 --> 00:18:06,780]  Okay. Thank you.\n",
            "[00:18:06,780 --> 00:18:10,690]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:18:10,690 --> 00:18:14,690]  Ladies and gentlemen, if you would like to register for a question, please press the number one key now.\n",
            "[00:18:14,690 --> 00:18:15,690]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:18:15,690 --> 00:18:22,110]  Next we have a follow-up question from Joseph Queen.\n",
            "[00:18:22,110 --> 00:18:23,110]  Please go ahead.\n",
            "[00:18:23,110 --> 00:18:24,270]  Hi, guys.\n",
            "[00:18:24,270 --> 00:18:30,270]  Can you give us some comments in relation to your digital TV at this stage?\n",
            "[00:18:30,270 --> 00:18:33,270]  What's your digital TV penetration?\n",
            "[00:18:33,270 --> 00:18:40,270]  And do you see a high cooperation between digital TV in terms of your broadband rollout as well?\n",
            "[00:18:40,270 --> 00:18:48,150]  Certainly, we are already sort of a bundle sales.\n",
            "[00:18:48,150 --> 00:19:02,060]  Digital TV subscriber is roughly 30%.\n",
            "[00:19:02,060 --> 00:19:05,950]  Right, 3%.\n",
            "[00:19:05,950 --> 00:19:08,260]  Yeah, 3%.\n",
            "[00:19:08,260 --> 00:19:20,670]  I think it's close to 20,000 people.\n",
            "[00:19:20,670 --> 00:19:21,670]  Okay. Thank you.\n",
            "[00:19:21,670 --> 00:19:23,670]  And can I ask one other question?\n",
            "[00:19:23,670 --> 00:19:29,670]  If, hypothetically, if the Tsai family do go ahead and purchase cable,\n",
            "[00:19:29,670 --> 00:19:35,670]  and a little bit down the road you see a change in the revision of the broadcasting law\n",
            "[00:19:35,670 --> 00:19:38,700]  to allow some indirect government holding,\n",
            "[00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:44,700]  do you envisage a short period after that that you would go ahead and try to purchase the remaining,\n",
            "[00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:47,700]  the actual cable from the Tsai family?\n",
            "[00:19:47,700 --> 00:19:50,630]  It's possible.\n",
            "[00:19:50,630 --> 00:20:01,960]  There are still a lot of barriers.\n",
            "[00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:04,960]  What would be the key issues to stop that happening?\n",
            "[00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:05,960]  Regulatory.\n",
            "[00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:08,310]  That's what has been stopping.\n",
            "[00:20:08,310 --> 00:20:10,110]  Oh, sorry.\n",
            "[00:20:10,110 --> 00:20:17,430]  I mean, if the regulatory issues are fixed and the Tsai family are already holding cable,\n",
            "[00:20:17,430 --> 00:20:23,460]  at that stage, do you see it as pretty straightforward progress that you go ahead and purchase it?\n",
            "[00:20:23,460 --> 00:20:29,900]  I think that the Tsai family is a large shareholder.\n",
            "[00:20:29,900 --> 00:20:37,420]  We certainly see that possibility.\n",
            "[00:20:37,420 --> 00:20:47,700]  If we're going to do that, there are processes that we would.\n",
            "[00:20:47,700 --> 00:20:51,780]  I can't tell you that this will be the case.\n",
            "[00:20:51,780 --> 00:20:54,070]  Okay. Thank you.\n",
            "[00:20:54,070 --> 00:20:57,980]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:20:57,980 --> 00:21:00,980]  Once again, ladies and gentlemen, if you would like to register for a question,\n",

            "[00:21:02,980 --> 00:21:26,890]  Once again, ladies and gentlemen, that is the number one key for questions.\n",
            "[00:21:26,890 --> 00:21:29,890]  Our next question comes from Rafi Sograbi of Citigroup Hong Kong.\n",
            "[00:21:29,890 --> 00:21:30,890]  Please go ahead.\n",
            "[00:21:30,890 --> 00:21:35,440]  Good afternoon.\n",
            "[00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:40,440]  I have one question, if I may, around the cable TV asset, the Cabro asset.\n",
            "[00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:46,440]  Would Taiwan Mobile be open to discussions, for example,\n",
            "[00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:53,440]  pre there being any change in the regulatory structure around indirect ownership of media assets?\n",
            "[00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:58,440]  Would Taiwan Mobile entertain discussions around potentially leasing the assets\n",
            "[00:21:58,440 --> 00:22:04,440]  or some kind of interconnect or resale structure around the Cabro asset?\n",
            "[00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:07,440]  Or could you see a number of issues that might prevent that?\n",
            "[00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:18,260]  I don't think we entertain any kind of ideas, but it depends on what the view is.\n",
            "[00:22:18,260 --> 00:22:26,700]  And has there been any mooted discussions in that direction as yet?\n",
            "[00:22:26,700 --> 00:22:28,700]  I cannot comment on that.\n",

            "[00:22:55,020 --> 00:23:02,020]  But since the cable case is already done by other, let's say, stakeholders,\n",
            "[00:23:02,020 --> 00:23:07,020]  what's the main issue for the management from now on,\n",
            "[00:23:07,020 --> 00:23:11,020]  we'll focus on for your whole business portfolio?\n",
            "[00:23:11,020 --> 00:23:14,020]  Because basically the cable issue has been,\n",
            "[00:23:14,020 --> 00:23:18,020]  the whole management has been solving this problem since last September.\n",
            "[00:23:18,020 --> 00:23:22,020]  What are the next topics the management will focus on from now on?\n",

            "[00:23:29,140 --> 00:23:39,960]  Unfortunately, I think the most obvious are cable TV operation,\n",
            "[00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:43,460]  hit a stone wall.\n",
            "[00:23:43,460 --> 00:23:52,830]  Still, we need to examine.\n",

            "[00:24:09,530 --> 00:24:13,530]  So you are still focused on, let's say, the network convergence or convergence between?\n",

            "[00:01:36,810 --> 00:01:41,810]  and then I will come to the summary of our third quarter results.\n",
            "[00:01:41,810 --> 00:01:47,840]  As most of you are already aware that today, this morning,\n",
            "[00:01:47,840 --> 00:02:03,380]  our board of directors has decided that my successor, who are Mr. Cliff Lai,\n",
            "[00:02:03,380 --> 00:02:11,380]  who used to be the head of our CBG, and Vivian Hsu, who used to be our CFO.\n",
            "[00:02:11,380 --> 00:02:19,380]  So Cliff Lai and Vivian Hsu will be co-presidents of the new management team,\n",
            "[00:02:19,380 --> 00:02:29,380]  and I will be providing all the assistance I can to ensure there will be a smooth management transition.\n",
            "[00:02:29,380 --> 00:02:35,380]  And later on, I think I will get Cliff to talk about the business.\n",
            "[00:02:35,380 --> 00:02:41,670]  And the second thing I want to talk about is the capital management that this morning,\n",
            "[00:02:41,670 --> 00:02:50,670]  our board also passed a resolution on capital management, which is a reduction of capital by 10%,\n",
            "[00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:55,670]  and later on, Vivian will also be talking, give you more details about it.\n",
            "[00:02:55,670 --> 00:03:00,900]  And then now let me come to the summary of the third quarter results.\n",
            "[00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:05,760]  Our third quarter revenue surpassed our guidance by 1%,\n",
            "[00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:10,760]  with revenues of three business groups coming better than expected.\n",
            "[00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:15,760]  In terms of EBITDA, both EBITDA and HBG exceeded their third quarter targets,\n",
            "[00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:19,760]  aided by higher than expected revenue and the lower expenses.\n",
            "[00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:24,760]  This helped to offset higher than expected smartphone subsidies in this quarter.\n",
            "[00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:32,300]  As a result, our third quarter consolidated EBITDA was in line with our expectations.\n",
            "[00:03:32,300 --> 00:03:37,300]  Our third quarter net income managed to grow 4% on a year-over-year basis,\n",
            "[00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:42,300]  due to lower asset write-off losses and the income taxes expenses.\n",
            "[00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:46,660]  And so let's go to the next page,\n",
            "[00:03:47,660 --> 00:03:55,660]  and I will turn the mic over to Cliff Lai, who will talk to you about our business performance.\n",

            "[00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:14,200]  consumer business EBITDA in the third quarter was due affected by increased smartphone subsidies\n",
            "[00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:17,490]  to grow our wireless data business.\n",
            "[00:04:17,490 --> 00:04:24,490]  For HBG, benefiting from large subscriber base and higher speed broadband service adoption,\n",

            "[00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:41,580]  backed by higher enterprise mobile revenue and contained operating expenses.\n",
            "[00:04:41,580 --> 00:04:47,580]  In the next three slides, I would like to highlight our two main growth drivers,\n",
            "[00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:50,610]  wireless data and cable internet.\n",
            "[00:04:50,610 --> 00:04:55,610]  First on wireless data, despite revenue pressure on mobile voice,\n",

            "[00:05:10,610 --> 00:05:19,610]  We attribute accelerating wireless data revenue growth to a 57% YOY increase in mobile internet access revenue.\n",
            "[00:05:19,610 --> 00:05:26,610]  Our bundling of smartphones with data rate plan leveled up wireless data output by more than 40%\n",
            "[00:05:26,610 --> 00:05:34,050]  and the number of active data users by more than 10% YOY.\n",
            "[00:05:34,050 --> 00:05:42,080]  In page 6, smartphone users generated more than two times of output than the company average.\n",
            "[00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:52,080]  Smartphone sell-through as a percentage of the total rose from 10% a year ago to 35% in third quarter.\n",
            "[00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:56,270]  Our smartphone strategy focused on the following.\n",
            "[00:05:56,270 --> 00:06:02,500]  More exclusive models from leading vendors to differentiate from others.\n",

            "[00:06:23,740 --> 00:06:27,900]  which level up broadband output by 4% YOY.\n",
            "[00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:33,900]  Benefiting from better economies of scale with 24% penetration,\n",
            "[00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:42,210]  our broadband internet has a 49% jump in EBITDA in third quarter from a year ago.\n",

            "[00:09:45,950 --> 00:09:54,950]  After that, our padding capital will become $34.2 billion from current $38 billion\n",
            "[00:09:54,950 --> 00:10:00,950]  with a full year estimated EPS of $4.62.\n",
            "[00:10:00,950 --> 00:10:04,950]  A stable dividend payout is expected.\n",
            "[00:10:04,950 --> 00:10:12,530]  And in the event update page, the award we received for this quarter\n",
            "[00:10:12,530 --> 00:10:14,530]  is for your reference.\n",
            "[00:10:14,530 --> 00:10:22,800]  And to write up our presentation, we would like to deliver some key messages.\n",
            "[00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:27,800]  The first one is that with succession made internally following\n",
            "[00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:32,800]  Harvey's chance to resign as the CEO and President,\n",
            "[00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:36,800]  a smooth transition of management is expected.\n",
            "[00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:42,930]  Enhancing shareholder value remains a priority of Taiwan Mobile.\n",
            "[00:10:42,930 --> 00:10:45,020]  And, Cliff?\n",
            "[00:10:45,020 --> 00:10:51,180]  Okay. Growth of data revenue continues to be an important initiative\n",
            "[00:10:51,180 --> 00:10:54,340]  for management the coming quarter.\n",
            "[00:10:54,340 --> 00:11:04,100]  GWM is confident in concluding the year with an EPS of $4.62 as guiding.\n",
            "[00:11:04,100 --> 00:11:07,970]  Now let's open up for Q&A.\n",
            "[00:11:07,970 --> 00:11:08,970]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:11:08,970 --> 00:11:10,970]  Ladies and gentlemen, we will now call for questions.\n",
            "[00:11:10,970 --> 00:11:14,970]  If you'd like to register for a question, please press the number one key now.\n",
            "[00:11:14,970 --> 00:11:25,020]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:11:25,020 --> 00:11:41,730]  Once again, ladies and gentlemen, that is number one key for questions.\n",
            "[00:11:41,730 --> 00:11:44,730]  Our first question comes from Joseph Queen of Macquarie, Taiwan.\n",
            "[00:11:44,730 --> 00:11:45,730]  Please go ahead.\n",
            "[00:11:45,730 --> 00:11:46,820]  Good afternoon, guys.\n",
            "[00:11:46,820 --> 00:11:48,820]  Thanks very much for the call.\n",
            "[00:11:48,820 --> 00:11:50,820]  Can I just ask one question?\n",
            "[00:11:50,820 --> 00:11:52,820]  On relation to the capital reduction,\n",
            "[00:11:52,820 --> 00:11:56,820]  can you talk a little bit more detail on when we should expect this?\n",
            "[00:11:56,820 --> 00:11:58,820]  Is it like in the beginning of next year?\n",
            "[00:11:58,820 --> 00:12:02,820]  And also just what was the thinking behind the need to do a capital reduction?\n",
            "[00:12:02,820 --> 00:12:06,710]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:12:06,710 --> 00:12:13,710]  The capital management plan is still subject to HGM's approval next June.\n",
            "[00:12:13,710 --> 00:12:27,580]  So theoretically, the payment day will be scheduled for mid-October next year.\n",
            "[00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:29,580]  Sorry, can you expand a little bit?\n",
            "[00:12:29,580 --> 00:12:30,580]  Yes, go ahead.\n",
            "[00:12:30,580 --> 00:12:32,580]  Yeah.\n",
            "[00:12:32,580 --> 00:12:38,500]  I think the main purpose for the capital management\n",
            "[00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:44,500]  is to maintain the stability of the dividend cash return of the shareholders.\n",
            "[00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:48,830]  This is Harvey.\n",
            "[00:12:48,830 --> 00:12:49,830]  This is Harvey.\n",
            "[00:12:49,830 --> 00:12:54,250]  Let me chip in on this.\n",
            "[00:12:54,250 --> 00:13:00,730]  In the past almost 10 months, we have not been talking about capital management,\n",
            "[00:13:00,730 --> 00:13:09,730]  primarily because of the uncertainty of the cable acquisition.\n",
            "[00:13:09,730 --> 00:13:15,730]  We are not sure how much cash we should remain on hand.\n",
            "[00:13:15,730 --> 00:13:16,730]  Everything cleared up.\n",
            "[00:13:16,730 --> 00:13:19,730]  Of course, when we come to the middle of the year,\n",
            "[00:13:19,730 --> 00:13:23,730]  we know the entity is not going to approve our acquisition,\n",
            "[00:13:23,730 --> 00:13:27,730]  but then there's a different deal going on,\n",
            "[00:13:27,730 --> 00:13:29,730]  and we still don't know what role we're going to play.\n",
            "[00:13:29,730 --> 00:13:33,730]  But now I think it seems to be pretty clear that we're not going to use our cash,\n",
            "[00:13:33,730 --> 00:13:36,760]  and that's also one of the reasons that we're doing this.\n",
            "[00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:37,760]  Okay, thank you.\n",
            "[00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:38,760]  That's very helpful.\n",
            "[00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:40,760]  Can I just add one other question?\n",
            "[00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:44,760]  When you say you're focused on more exclusive models,\n",
            "[00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:47,760]  I see in your presentation you're talking about Samsung and Motorola\n",
            "[00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:50,620]  and different devices.\n",
            "[00:13:50,620 --> 00:13:55,620]  Is there any reason then why we see such a large increase in handset subsidies?\n",
            "[00:13:55,620 --> 00:14:00,620]  Are these devices not generally cheaper than what we would expect from the iPhone 4,\n",
            "[00:14:00,620 --> 00:14:08,060]  for example, or is the iPhone 4 still going to make up a very large part of this product mix?\n",
            "[00:14:08,060 --> 00:14:10,060]  Yes.\n",
            "[00:14:10,060 --> 00:14:14,060]  The reason we focus on exclusive models is that, as you know,\n",
            "[00:14:14,060 --> 00:14:17,100]  the current market is very mature,\n",
            "[00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:24,100]  so only by providing exclusive models you can reach customers or competitors.\n",
            "[00:14:24,100 --> 00:14:29,160]  Secondly is that by having exclusive models,\n",
            "[00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:35,450]  we can reach a better arrangement with vendors so that we can have better pricing.\n",
            "[00:14:35,450 --> 00:14:40,450]  Currently, the focus of Tala Mobile is to sell Android platform handsets,\n",
            "[00:14:41,450 --> 00:14:51,150]  and in general, the subsidy level of Android mobile handsets are much lower than iPhone.\n",
            "[00:14:51,150 --> 00:14:59,150]  But in the past quarter, we do see there are strong needs for iPhone 4.\n",
            "[00:14:59,150 --> 00:15:05,150]  The consumers in Taiwan seem to have a new passion for iPhone 4,\n",
            "[00:15:05,150 --> 00:15:11,820]  so that demand is higher than we have expected earlier.\n",
            "[00:15:11,820 --> 00:15:15,610]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:15:15,610 --> 00:15:16,610]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:15:16,610 --> 00:15:19,610]  Once again, ladies and gentlemen, if you would like to register for a question,\n",
            "[00:15:19,610 --> 00:15:22,600]  please press the number 1 key now.\n",
            "[00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:25,600]  Our next question comes from Ray Ling from UBS Hong Kong.\n",
            "[00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:28,270]  Please go ahead.\n",
            "[00:15:28,270 --> 00:15:32,300]  Hi. This is a follow-up question on the capital reduction.\n",
            "[00:15:32,300 --> 00:15:38,300]  You mentioned that now that the cable acquisition is not going to happen for Taiwan Mobile,\n",
            "[00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:40,300]  you can do a capital reduction.\n",
            "[00:15:40,300 --> 00:15:48,300]  So going forward, does it mean that Taiwan Mobile has abandoned plans to look at other cable MSOs?\n",
            "[00:15:48,300 --> 00:15:55,300]  And if so, what does it mean for Taiwan Mobile's cable plans?\n",
            "[00:15:55,300 --> 00:16:00,300]  And does it also mean that capital reduction can be maintained on an ongoing basis?\n",
            "[00:16:02,870 --> 00:16:08,870]  For the moment, you know that we are restricted by the law,\n",
            "[00:16:08,870 --> 00:16:16,870]  which prohibits us from acquiring cables directly due to their indirect government,\n",
            "[00:16:16,870 --> 00:16:22,870]  due to full-blown indirect government in our company.\n",
            "[00:16:22,870 --> 00:16:26,870]  So once the law gets revised,\n",
            "[00:16:27,870 --> 00:16:33,870]  actually we don't rule out the possibility of getting the cable access.\n",
            "[00:16:33,870 --> 00:16:39,870]  But then in that case, if NCC approves some Thai family's acquisition this time,\n",
            "[00:16:39,870 --> 00:16:45,870]  then we will have to negotiate with the Thai family's entity.\n",
            "[00:16:45,870 --> 00:16:50,980]  So if I understand you correctly,\n",
            "[00:16:50,980 --> 00:16:55,980]  there are plans if NCC approves the Thai family acquisition for Taiwan Mobile\n",
            "[00:16:55,980 --> 00:17:02,130]  to eventually look at acquiring cable from the Thai family?\n",
            "[00:17:02,130 --> 00:17:05,130]  We don't rule out this possibility.\n",
            "[00:17:05,130 --> 00:17:11,700]  But we have to get the law revised first.\n",
            "[00:17:11,700 --> 00:17:16,930]  So in the event that there are no further cable acquisitions,\n",
            "[00:17:16,930 --> 00:17:21,630]  can we expect caption to be maintained?\n",
            "[00:17:21,630 --> 00:17:24,630]  It's still subject to the board approval.\n",
            "[00:17:24,630 --> 00:17:31,630]  So what we can tell you now is that this time we did get board approval.\n",
            "[00:17:31,630 --> 00:17:40,980]  But of course, as you know that we have more flexibility to do capital management.\n",
            "[00:17:40,980 --> 00:17:44,980]  Currently, based on our balance sheet,\n",
            "[00:17:44,980 --> 00:17:52,980]  we have 12.4 billion in capital surplus and about 3 billion in retained earnings,\n",
            "[00:17:52,980 --> 00:17:58,980]  which can be used as additional source for capital management in the future.\n",
            "[00:17:58,980 --> 00:18:06,980]  Apart from that, there is still some room in the capital base,\n",
            "[00:18:06,980 --> 00:18:14,910]  which may provide us with more cushion to do capital management in the future.\n",
            "[00:18:14,910 --> 00:18:18,520]  If I may, just one more question.\n",
            "[00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:21,520]  Then how do we think about your regular dividend going forward?\n",
            "[00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:25,150]  Will that then be reduced?\n",
            "[00:18:25,150 --> 00:18:29,150]  Basically, we are very committal to enhancing shareholder return.\n",
            "[00:18:29,150 --> 00:18:37,380]  So basically, we will distribute 90% of our EPS,\n",
            "[00:18:37,380 --> 00:18:41,730]  which is of course subject to board approval.\n",
            "[00:18:41,730 --> 00:18:46,900]  Okay, thank you very much.\n",
            "[00:18:46,900 --> 00:18:47,900]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:18:47,900 --> 00:18:50,900]  We have a follow-up question from Joseph Quinn of Macquarie Taiwan.\n",
            "[00:18:50,900 --> 00:18:52,570]  Please go ahead.\n",
            "[00:18:52,570 --> 00:18:57,570]  Sorry, just on that capital management payout,\n",
            "[00:18:57,570 --> 00:19:00,570]  would we be right in assuming that this would happen at the same time\n",
            "[00:19:00,570 --> 00:19:02,570]  as the dividend being paid out next year?\n",
            "[00:19:02,570 --> 00:19:09,300]  Oh, sorry.\n",
            "[00:19:09,300 --> 00:19:13,300]  The dividend is normally paid in July.\n",
            "[00:19:13,300 --> 00:19:17,300]  It should be distributed by end of July every year.\n",
            "[00:19:17,300 --> 00:19:23,300]  And for the capital return, capital reduction of $1\n",
            "[00:19:23,300 --> 00:19:27,300]  is expected to be paid in mid-October next year.\n",
            "[00:19:27,300 --> 00:19:28,650]  Okay, thank you.\n",
            "[00:19:28,650 --> 00:19:33,650]  As I just mentioned, it requires HDM's approval in June.\n",
            "[00:19:33,650 --> 00:19:34,650]  Understood.\n",
            "[00:19:34,650 --> 00:19:35,650]  Thanks very much.\n",
            "[00:19:35,650 --> 00:19:39,300]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:19:39,300 --> 00:19:40,300]  Once again, ladies and gentlemen,\n",
            "[00:19:40,300 --> 00:19:41,300]  if you would like to register for a question,\n",
            "[00:19:41,300 --> 00:19:43,300]  please press the number 1 key now.\n",
            "[00:19:43,300 --> 00:19:44,300]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:19:44,300 --> 00:19:55,310]  Our next question comes from Li Teng Huan of Nomura Hong Kong.\n",
            "[00:19:55,310 --> 00:19:56,310]  Please go ahead.\n",
            "[00:19:56,310 --> 00:19:57,310]  Thank you, management.\n",
            "[00:19:57,310 --> 00:19:59,310]  So I have two questions.\n",
            "[00:19:59,310 --> 00:20:04,310]  The first question is about the competition landscape\n",
            "[00:20:04,310 --> 00:20:07,310]  of cable TV industry basically in Taiwan.\n",
            "[00:20:07,310 --> 00:20:10,310]  So after these, I mean, the two acquisitions,\n",
            "[00:20:10,310 --> 00:20:12,310]  I mean, two ownership changes,\n",
            "[00:20:12,310 --> 00:20:17,310]  I mean, your company's cable TV operators still maintain,\n",
            "[00:20:17,310 --> 00:20:20,310]  I mean, the scale was quite small.\n",
            "[00:20:20,310 --> 00:20:23,310]  What do you plan to grow this business?\n",
            "[00:20:23,310 --> 00:20:27,310]  Are there any progress to cooperate with cable\n",
            "[00:20:27,310 --> 00:20:32,310]  or basically what's the comment on this cable TV industry in Taiwan?\n",
            "[00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:39,500]  The competitive landscape in the cable TV market is still quite stable.\n",
            "[00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:43,500]  As you know that we enjoy regional monopoly.\n",
            "[00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:50,530]  And as to how we can scale up the business,\n",
            "[00:20:50,530 --> 00:20:54,530]  I think we will still grow organically,\n",
            "[00:20:54,530 --> 00:20:57,530]  both organically and inorganically.\n",
            "[00:20:57,530 --> 00:21:02,530]  Organically meaning that we will have to step up the penetration\n",
            "[00:21:02,530 --> 00:21:04,530]  of cable broadband to grow the business.\n",
            "[00:21:04,530 --> 00:21:08,530]  At the same time, we will grow the digital TV business\n",
            "[00:21:08,530 --> 00:21:15,530]  which accounts for a small part of our revenue currently.\n",
            "[00:21:15,530 --> 00:21:19,530]  And in terms of subscriber, it's still below 10%.\n",
            "[00:21:19,530 --> 00:21:22,530]  So there's ample room for growth.\n",
            "[00:21:22,530 --> 00:21:26,530]  But as to inorganic growth,\n",
            "[00:21:26,530 --> 00:21:32,530]  I think we will have to rely on acquisition when the law gets relaxed.\n",
            "[00:21:32,530 --> 00:21:40,850]  And at this moment, before the law gets revised,\n",
            "[00:21:40,850 --> 00:21:46,850]  we cannot have any cooperation with cable.\n",
            "[00:21:46,850 --> 00:21:48,520]  Okay.\n",
            "[00:21:48,520 --> 00:21:51,520]  So you cannot have any cooperation even,\n",
            "[00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:56,220]  I mean, without any shareholder relationship\n",
            "[00:21:56,220 --> 00:21:59,700]  or like co-marketing or this stuff?\n",
            "[00:21:59,700 --> 00:22:03,700]  In that case, we may run a file of antitrust law.\n",
            "[00:22:03,700 --> 00:22:08,100]  So the second question is,\n",
            "[00:22:08,100 --> 00:22:12,100]  can you briefly introduce the background of new management team\n",
            "[00:22:12,100 --> 00:22:16,100]  and what will be the time schedule for the new management team\n",
            "[00:22:16,100 --> 00:22:19,100]  to form certain new visions of the company,\n",
            "[00:22:19,100 --> 00:22:28,450]  the new plan of the company?\n",
            "[00:22:28,450 --> 00:22:32,450]  Cliff is our COO.\n",
            "[00:22:32,450 --> 00:22:36,450]  He has double E degree\n",
            "[00:22:36,450 --> 00:22:44,670]  and has extensive working experience with telecom-related companies for the past.\n",
            "[00:22:44,670 --> 00:22:53,670]  Vivian used to be working for various telecom companies too,\n",
            "[00:22:53,670 --> 00:22:57,670]  like Casey Telecom.\n",
            "[00:22:57,670 --> 00:23:04,670]  And also he was the CFO of Cafe Financial Holdings before.\n",
            "[00:23:04,670 --> 00:23:08,670]  And he is the CFO of Taiwan Mobile.\n",
            "[00:23:08,670 --> 00:23:18,280]  And also he was the president of Taiwan Six Network in 2007.\n",
            "[00:23:18,280 --> 00:23:25,280]  What will be the role between two, I mean, co-presidents?\n",
            "[00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:29,280]  Cliff will be heading up the operations\n",
            "[00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:37,280]  and Vivian will be heading up the administration part of the company.\n",
            "[00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:41,440]  So they will have divided roles in the future.\n",
            "[00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:50,160]  The new appointment actually will be effective next January.\n",

            "[00:23:55,140 --> 00:23:56,140]  Once again, ladies and gentlemen,\n",
            "[00:23:56,140 --> 00:23:58,140]  if you'd like to register for a question,\n",

            "[00:24:00,140 --> 00:24:13,640]  Our next question comes from Rafi Sadovi.\n",
            "[00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:14,640]  Yes, go ahead.\n",
            "[00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:16,500]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:20,500]  Good afternoon and congratulations on a solid set of numbers.\n",
            "[00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:24,500]  I have a question relating to slide five where you talk,\n",
            "[00:24:24,500 --> 00:24:27,500]  where you spoke about the wireless data revenues\n",
            "[00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:32,500]  and the difference in ARPUs that you also referred to\n",
            "[00:24:32,500 --> 00:24:36,500]  between smartphone subscribers and regular blended.\n",
            "[00:24:36,500 --> 00:24:40,500]  I wanted to get a feel for, in your current total subscriber base,\n",
            "[00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:46,500]  what percentage is made up of smartphones roughly, do you believe, today?\n",
            "[00:24:46,500 --> 00:24:49,500]  I guess, you know, in terms of defining smartphones,\n",
            "[00:24:49,500 --> 00:24:52,500]  I guess I'm referring to, you know, Android plus iPhone,\n",
            "[00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:57,900]  not really including Symbian.\n",
            "[00:24:57,900 --> 00:25:02,900]  Currently, the smartphone user base in our total network\n",
            "[00:25:02,900 --> 00:25:05,900]  is still less than 10% of our subscribers.\n",
            "[00:25:05,900 --> 00:25:08,900]  But the number is increasing rapidly.\n",
            "[00:25:08,900 --> 00:25:15,640]  So we will expect the smartphone take-up rate will increase in the future.\n",
            "[00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:22,640]  And even though there are many, many platforms,\n",
            "[00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:27,640]  but the current focus of Taiwan Mobile is really on Android and the Blackberry.\n",
            "[00:25:27,640 --> 00:25:32,640]  But we try to provide all the different platforms.\n",
            "[00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:38,640]  For instance, we provide Windows, Symbian, and Apple.\n",
            "[00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:47,640]  So we are the only operator in Taiwan which provides a complete OS to our end customers.\n",
            "[00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:50,720]  Thank you very much.\n",
            "[00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:53,720]  And one quick follow-up question there.\n",
            "[00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:58,720]  In terms of the average monthly data usage,\n",
            "[00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:02,720]  I think the global average for an iPhone is 500 megs a month\n",
            "[00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:05,720]  and for an Android phone, 300 megs a month.\n",
            "[00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:12,860]  I wonder what your experience is on those two platforms within your subscriber base.\n",
            "[00:26:12,860 --> 00:26:25,960]  Let me check a little.\n",
            "[00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:29,960]  Our case is also very similar to world markets.\n",
            "[00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:36,960]  The average monthly data usage for iPhone users is slightly above 400 megs.\n",
            "[00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:41,210]  Thank you very much. That's very helpful.\n",
            "[00:26:41,210 --> 00:26:46,950]  Thank you. One second, ladies and gentlemen.\n",

            "[00:22:08,770 --> 00:22:13,770]  What is the current percentage of your subscriber base already on smartphones?\n",

            "[00:22:41,990 --> 00:22:51,990]  Basically, you know, just as Cliff mentioned that the pickup in data growth\n",
            "[00:22:51,990 --> 00:22:57,990]  will offset the decline in voice service this year.\n",
            "[00:22:57,990 --> 00:23:05,990]  So basically, we are seeing 1% growth excluding handset sales.\n",
            "[00:23:05,990 --> 00:23:18,900]  And that is including both mobile and cable, 1% service revenue growth?\n",

            "[00:24:05,940 --> 00:24:07,940]  I guess I still have one more question,\n",
            "[00:24:07,940 --> 00:24:10,940]  which is my first question regarding your smartphone penetration\n",
            "[00:24:10,940 --> 00:24:13,940]  and percentage of new sales on smartphones as well.\n",
            "[00:24:13,940 --> 00:24:26,200]  The smartphone pen, in year 2010, we sold around 450,000 smartphones.\n",

            "[00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:50,780]  smartphone sales roughly take up close to 45% of our total phone sales.\n",
            "[00:24:50,780 --> 00:25:03,860]  And in this year, our projection is close to 50% of our total phone sales.\n",
            "[00:25:03,860 --> 00:25:10,860]  So the smart device penetration among the subscribers is about 10%,\n",
            "[00:25:10,860 --> 00:25:17,780]  slightly over 10%, about 11% by year-end.\n",

            "[00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:34,080]  I noticed for the mobile divisions,\n",
            "[00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:42,080]  CapEx is increased by about 10% from 2010's level.\n",
            "[00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:49,080]  Is it possible to share with us what kind of total data traffic flow increment,\n",
            "[00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:55,080]  percentage-wise, you're forecasting in order to increase that 10% CapEx?\n",
            "[00:25:55,080 --> 00:25:59,080]  Is it possible just by increasing the CapEx by 10%\n",
            "[00:25:59,080 --> 00:26:05,080]  and handle all the additional data traffic that you're forecasting for 2011?\n",
            "[00:26:05,080 --> 00:26:21,660]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:26:21,660 --> 00:26:33,660]  The forecast for the data traffic growth for 2011 is roughly 80% more than 2010.\n",
            "[00:26:33,660 --> 00:26:41,660]  And our estimation is with a 10% increase in CapEx can cover the need of the 80% growth.\n",
            "[00:26:41,660 --> 00:26:48,660]  And plus, we have negotiated with our vendors to reduce the equipment price.\n",
            "[00:26:48,660 --> 00:26:55,660]  That's why we only need 10% increase in the CapEx to cover the need for the traffic growth.\n",
            "[00:26:55,660 --> 00:27:01,960]  So just to reconfirm,\n",
            "[00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:08,960]  so 10% increase in your CapEx is enough to cover 80% increase in data traffic flow this year, right?\n",
            "[00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:09,960]  Yes.\n",
            "[00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:10,960]  Thank you.\n",

            "[00:27:14,490 --> 00:27:17,490]  Next, we have a question from Leo Anderson of BC Hong Kong.\n",

            "[00:27:20,220 --> 00:27:23,220]  Sorry, just one follow-up question on the smartphone issue.\n",
            "[00:27:23,220 --> 00:27:28,220]  45% of handsets sold in December were smartphones.\n",
            "[00:27:28,220 --> 00:27:34,220]  And as you say, the cost for Android phones in particular is going to decrease significantly through 2011.\n",
            "[00:27:34,220 --> 00:27:40,260]  Do you not think that your forecast for 50% of phones sold to be smartphones this year\n",
            "[00:27:40,260 --> 00:27:43,260]  might be a little conservative given that trend?\n",
            "[00:27:43,260 --> 00:27:44,290]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:27:45,900 --> 00:28:03,580]  Well, at the end of 2009, the smartphone sale only take up maybe less than 10%.\n",
            "[00:28:03,580 --> 00:28:05,580]  Last year, it was tremendous.\n",
            "[00:28:05,580 --> 00:28:11,220]  So we grew from less than 10% to almost 45%.\n",
            "[00:28:11,220 --> 00:28:21,860]  We are a little conservative regarding the growth of this year.\n",
            "[00:28:21,860 --> 00:28:42,900]  In the first quarter and second quarter, I think in the fourth quarter of last year,\n",
            "[00:28:42,900 --> 00:28:45,900]  we have seen a very strong demand on iPhones.\n",
            "[00:28:45,900 --> 00:28:53,020]  The iPhone demand was dropped off in the second quarter and the first quarter.\n",
            "[00:28:53,020 --> 00:29:01,360]  That's why the total projection for Android is still 50% because on the fourth quarter, we have a‚Ä¶\n",

            "[00:31:38,730 --> 00:31:42,730]  Our next question comes from Alastair Jones of New Street Research in London.\n",
            "[00:31:42,730 --> 00:31:43,730]  Please go ahead.\n",
            "[00:31:43,730 --> 00:31:51,730]  Hi. I was wondering if you could just detail the extent of the fixed-to-mobile price cut that the regulators demanded,\n",
            "[00:31:51,730 --> 00:31:55,730]  what the current tariff is, and how quickly that's going to go down.\n",
            "[00:31:55,730 --> 00:31:58,730]  I know you said 50% of the cut is coming through in 2011,\n",
            "[00:31:58,730 --> 00:32:01,730]  but just to gauge how big the cut is overall,\n",
            "[00:32:01,730 --> 00:32:06,730]  and then also what percentage of your revenues on the mobile side come through from Interconnect\n",
            "[00:32:06,730 --> 00:32:09,730]  or fixed-to-mobile Interconnect revenues?\n",
            "[00:32:09,730 --> 00:32:10,730]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:32:16,940 --> 00:32:35,650]  Yeah, the price cut is roughly 30% in the first year,\n",
            "[00:32:35,650 --> 00:32:49,080]  from about 5.2 NT per minute to 3.65 NT per minute.\n",
            "[00:32:49,080 --> 00:32:52,240]  Okay. And then in subsequent years, is that being decided?\n",
            "[00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:58,240]  Subsequent years, the difference will be 17 cents for the second year\n",
            "[00:32:59,240 --> 00:33:04,400]  and 27 cents each year later on.\n",
            "[00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:13,830]  Okay. Great. And the percentage of your revenues on the mobile side that comes through from this traffic?\n",
            "[00:33:13,830 --> 00:33:21,380]  It's only less than 7% from fixed-to-mobile currently.\n",
            "[00:33:21,380 --> 00:33:25,200]  Yeah. Great. Thank you.\n",
            "[00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:28,220]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:33:28,220 --> 00:33:32,220]  Our next question comes from Piyush Mubayi of Goldman Sachs Hong Kong.\n",
            "[00:33:32,220 --> 00:33:33,220]  Please go ahead.\n",
            "[00:33:33,220 --> 00:33:37,220]  Thank you. Could you remind us what your capital reduction plans for 2011 are?\n",
            "[00:33:37,220 --> 00:33:38,220]  If you could share that with us.\n",
            "[00:33:38,220 --> 00:33:47,220]  Second, if you could shed some light on one of the early questions asked about the data usage by smartphones on your network, please.\n",
            "[00:33:47,220 --> 00:33:52,220]  And the third, if you could talk a little through how tablets are faring in Taiwan, that would be very useful.\n",
            "[00:33:52,220 --> 00:33:53,220]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:33:53,220 --> 00:34:12,980]  Regarding the data usage of smartphones and the tablets, currently the smartphone, the bandwidth,\n",
            "[00:34:12,980 --> 00:34:19,980]  the transmission bandwidth consumed by the smartphone is only one-tenth of the data card or tablet.\n",
            "[00:34:19,980 --> 00:34:27,200]  So smartphones tend to give us a better margin than data cards or tablets.\n",
            "[00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:32,200]  For 2010, we didn't see too much growth in the tablets.\n",
            "[00:34:32,200 --> 00:34:43,360]  Two, and now, and when the Android platforms are ready in the second quarter of this year,\n",
            "[00:34:43,360 --> 00:34:56,600]  we expect a very strong take-up rate for tablets starting from the second quarter onward to the fourth quarter.\n",
            "[00:34:56,600 --> 00:35:02,600]  You mentioned that it's one-tenth of data cards and tablets in terms of usage for smartphones.\n",
            "[00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:05,600]  What is the usage for data cards and tablets, please?\n",
            "[00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:10,600]  For data card, it's roughly 7 to 8G per month.\n",
            "[00:35:10,600 --> 00:35:19,270]  For the smartphone, it's only one-tenth of the data card usage.\n",
            "[00:35:19,270 --> 00:35:24,400]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:27,400]  Once again, ladies and gentlemen, that is the number one key for questions.\n",
            "[00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:28,400]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:44,140]  Once again, ladies and gentlemen, if you'd like to register for a question, please press the number one key now.\n",

            "[00:35:45,140 --> 00:36:02,810]  Once again, ladies and gentlemen, that is the number one key for questions.\n",
            "[00:36:02,810 --> 00:36:10,700]  There seems to be no further questions at this point in time.\n",
            "[00:36:10,700 --> 00:36:11,700]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:36:11,700 --> 00:36:12,800]  Okay.\n",
            "[00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:13,800]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:18,800]  We wish you a happy Chinese New Year.\n",
            "[00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:20,800]  Happy Chinese New Year.\n",
            "[00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:21,800]  Thank you.\n",

            "[00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:06,000]  Good morning, good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to the Taiwan Mobile Conference Call on 4th Quarter Results 2009.\n",
            "[00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000]  Our chairperson today is Ms. Rosy Yu and Mr. Harvey Chan.\n",
            "[00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:15,660]  Rosy, please begin your call and I'll just stand by. Thank you.\n",
            "[00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:24,390]  Hi, everyone. Welcome to our 4th Quarter Conference Call.\n",
            "[00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:43,390]  Before we start our presentation of 4th Quarter Results, let me direct your attention to the first page disclaimer that the information contained in this presentation, including all forward-looking information, is subject to change without notice.\n",
            "[00:00:43,390 --> 00:00:53,390]  Whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, Taiwan Mobile undertakes no obligation to update or revise the information contained in this presentation.\n",
            "[00:00:53,390 --> 00:01:03,390]  No representation or warranty either expressed or implied is provided in relation to the accuracy, completeness or reliability of the information contained in it.\n",
            "[00:01:03,390 --> 00:01:15,570]  Nor is the information intended to be a complete statement of the company, market or developments referred to in this presentation.\n",
            "[00:01:15,570 --> 00:01:28,880]  Our presentation today basically contains a summary of P&L, divisional performance and some analysis and financials.\n",
            "[00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:37,740]  And then we will talk about our forecast for this quarter as well as an event update.\n",
            "[00:01:37,740 --> 00:02:03,020]  First, the next page will give you the result summary that our last quarter, the actual operating revenue is $16.8 billion, which compared to our forecast is 96%,\n",
            "[00:02:03,020 --> 00:02:14,050]  but our operating income is $5.1 billion, which is 102% of our guidance.\n",
            "[00:02:14,050 --> 00:02:19,980]  And then our net income is right on target, which is $3.5 billion.\n",
            "[00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:32,140]  EPS is $1.17, EBITDA is 44%.\n",
            "[00:02:32,140 --> 00:02:46,140]  If you look on our total year basis, you can see that our total revenue is down 1% on a year-over-year basis,\n",
            "[00:02:46,140 --> 00:02:57,680]  with rising sales revenue and newly added content agency business partially offsetting the drop in telecom revenue.\n",
            "[00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:12,680]  We continue to control our costs and expenses effectively, which helps us minimize the impact on the net income arising from the revenue decline as a result\n",
            "[00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:28,540]  that we complete the year with a net income of $13.8 billion or $80, $4.66 in terms of EPS.\n",
            "[00:03:28,540 --> 00:03:39,540]  If you turn to the next page, which deals with the divisional performance, the first one is our consumer business.\n",
            "[00:03:39,540 --> 00:03:48,830]  In the fourth quarter, our CPG continues seeing a narrowed mobile revenue decline.\n",
            "[00:03:48,830 --> 00:04:00,060]  EBITDA year-on-year change turned positive this quarter from negative in the previous quarters.\n",
            "[00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:09,340]  Our HBG was growing pay TV content and broadband business.\n",
            "[00:04:09,340 --> 00:04:15,340]  HBG reported a double-digit year-over-year increase in revenue and EBITDA.\n",
            "[00:04:15,340 --> 00:04:28,340]  And it's also worth mentioning that our cable broadband EBITDA market expanded to 47% in the fourth quarter versus a year ago, which is only 29%.\n",
            "[00:04:28,340 --> 00:04:33,340]  This is primarily due to an economy of scale.\n",
            "[00:04:33,340 --> 00:04:47,340]  As to our enterprise business, our EBG mobile revenue remained stable on a year-over-year basis while fixed line revenue dropped on a year-over-year last quarter.\n",
            "[00:04:47,340 --> 00:05:03,050]  However, in terms of EBITDA, our EBG reported a year-over-year growth due to better control of operating expenses.\n",
            "[00:05:03,050 --> 00:05:13,580]  The next page is a comparison of the wireless business with our competitors.\n",
            "[00:05:13,580 --> 00:05:29,800]  Our mobile subscriber number rose 2.2% on a year-over-year basis, coming largely from the 114,000 data card subscriber addition.\n",
            "[00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:46,620]  Compared to our closest competitor, we stood out in terms of mobile service revenue, mobile EBITDA, EBITDA margin as well as total subscribers.\n",
            "[00:05:46,620 --> 00:06:08,620]  And then the next page, in terms of the number of better-added services as well as 3G, that we continue our very healthy VADS revenue growth momentum of 24% on a year-over-year basis.\n",
            "[00:06:08,620 --> 00:06:21,330]  Last quarter, this mainly came from a 54% revenue increase from mobile Internet users.\n",
            "[00:06:21,330 --> 00:06:36,330]  And then our 3G postpaid subscriber number in the fourth quarter exceeded 3.3 million, up 48% on a year-over-year basis and make up 58% of total postpaid.\n",
            "[00:06:36,330 --> 00:06:43,330]  Our 3G data revenue was up 96% from a year ago.\n",
            "[00:06:43,330 --> 00:06:50,310]  And let me turn the mic over to Rosie to talk about the financials.\n",
            "[00:06:50,310 --> 00:06:52,310]  Hi, good afternoon.\n",
            "[00:06:52,310 --> 00:07:01,310]  Our fourth quarter operating cash flow rose from a quarter ago, mainly due to the payments of corporate taxing our third quarter last year.\n",
            "[00:07:01,310 --> 00:07:11,310]  The fourth quarter, 2009 investing cash outlay was largely for the 1.83 billion in CapEx.\n",
            "[00:07:11,310 --> 00:07:33,310]  In terms of financing activities, total borrowings decreased by 6 billion in the last quarter as we borrowed 3.8 billion of new short-term debt to repay 2.3 billion of syndicate loan and 7.5 billion of corporate balance due.\n",
            "[00:07:33,310 --> 00:07:57,410]  Our total cash CapEx in 2009 was $6.67 billion or 9.7% of revenue, of which $4.88 billion was for mobile, $1.35 billion for fixed line, and $0.44 billion for cable TV.\n",
            "[00:07:57,410 --> 00:08:10,440]  For 2009, we generated $17.28 billion in free cash flow, of which $13.97 billion was used to pay dividends.\n",
            "[00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:27,540]  On the balance sheet analysis, our cash balance remained stable and net property plan and equipment balance at the end of last quarter was down sequentially, with depreciation and write-off higher than CapEx.\n",
            "[00:08:27,540 --> 00:08:42,630]  The 2G's net book value was reduced to $16.9 billion, while 3G's book value rose to $12.6 billion as of the end of last year.\n",
            "[00:08:42,630 --> 00:08:58,630]  With a $6 billion reduction in borrowings in the previous quarter, as mentioned earlier, our gross debt dropped to $15.6 billion and net debt was down to $12.6 billion.\n",
            "[00:08:58,630 --> 00:09:07,660]  So net debt to equity and net debt to EBITDA was 24% and 0.43 times in 2009.\n",
            "[00:09:07,660 --> 00:09:11,660]  So let me turn this over to Harvey for first quarter guidance.\n",
            "[00:09:11,660 --> 00:09:34,740]  For this coming quarter, we forecast our total revenue to edge up by 1% on a year-over-year basis with cable TV, broadband, wireless data, and mobile device sales that will show a growth.\n",
            "[00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:43,740]  Among the three business groups, both CBG and HBG are expected to show positive profit growth first quarter of this year.\n",
            "[00:09:43,740 --> 00:10:00,860]  CBG first quarter is estimated to have a flat revenue change and stable subscriber acquisition and retention-related expenses.\n",
            "[00:10:00,860 --> 00:10:09,340]  That said, the company's increased number of direct stores will also lead to an increase of operating expense.\n",
            "[00:10:09,340 --> 00:10:20,840]  On a consolidated basis, our G&A expense in first quarter will see a 7% year-over-year increase,\n",
            "[00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:33,380]  explained by this one-time expense reverse last year first quarter and our conservative estimate of the beta expense.\n",
            "[00:10:33,380 --> 00:10:47,380]  Our non-operating expense in first quarter is estimated to be $80,247 million down 52% on a year-over-year basis\n",
            "[00:10:47,380 --> 00:11:01,180]  and with 41% less in asset write-off than a year ago.\n",
            "[00:11:01,180 --> 00:11:23,510]  Some event updates, and I will leave that to you to refer in the next couple of pages.\n",
            "[00:11:23,510 --> 00:11:35,930]  The key message is that we are able to meet the 2009 guidance through our expense discipline\n",
            "[00:11:35,930 --> 00:11:41,930]  with a firm outlook on the economic front for 2010.\n",
            "[00:11:41,930 --> 00:11:51,470]  We expect to face the challenges from the regulatory interventions.\n",
            "[00:11:51,470 --> 00:11:57,470]  Approval for the acquisition of Carla's cable assets is still pending.\n",
            "[00:11:57,470 --> 00:12:06,470]  Before we get approval, we continue to fine-tune our business to meet the challenges.\n",
            "[00:12:06,470 --> 00:12:20,660]  That wraps up my presentation today and we will be happy to take questions.\n",
            "[00:12:20,660 --> 00:12:21,660]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:12:21,660 --> 00:12:23,660]  Ladies and gentlemen, we will now open for questions.\n",
            "[00:12:23,660 --> 00:12:27,660]  If you would like to register for a question, please press the number 1 key now. Thank you.\n",
            "[00:12:27,660 --> 00:12:39,540]  The first question comes from Terry Chan from Credit Suisse Hong Kong. Please go ahead.\n",
            "[00:12:39,540 --> 00:12:44,540]  Hi. Good afternoon. Thank you for the call. I have three questions.\n",
            "[00:12:44,540 --> 00:12:49,540]  The first question is, can you give us some updates on the cable acquisition deal?\n",
            "[00:12:49,540 --> 00:12:54,760]  Where is it up to now and is there any regulatory hurdles?\n",
            "[00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:59,760]  My second question is, what is the dividend for 2009?\n",
            "[00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:06,760]  My last question is, do you have any earning estimate impact from the tariff reduction policy\n",
            "[00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:20,140]  which has just been put out by NCC? Thank you.\n",
            "[00:13:20,140 --> 00:13:29,300]  Not much can be reported on this cable acquisition deal.\n",
            "[00:13:29,300 --> 00:13:39,000]  Right now, we are still waiting for the regulatory approvals,\n",
            "[00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:47,000]  which is not the most pleasant thing to deal with.\n",
            "[00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:53,000]  Anyway, hopefully we can work through it.\n",
            "[00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:58,290]  It's always a challenge to talk to the regulators.\n",
            "[00:13:58,290 --> 00:14:04,290]  I cannot tell you the 2009 dividend at this point.\n",
            "[00:14:04,290 --> 00:14:15,610]  I think this subject will be discussed in our next board meeting, which is scheduled in late April.\n",
            "[00:14:15,610 --> 00:14:25,410]  At that time, we will make an announcement on the dividends for the year 2009.\n",
            "[00:14:26,410 --> 00:14:48,060]  As far as the earning impact, right now, actually, we have done some calculations.\n",
            "[00:14:48,060 --> 00:15:00,060]  I think we are still waiting for NCC's final decision.\n",
            "[00:15:00,060 --> 00:15:05,420]  If they are going to do what they want to do,\n",
            "[00:15:05,420 --> 00:15:23,910]  I think it will be an impact on the net income in the range of $800 million or so.\n",
            "[00:15:23,910 --> 00:15:27,010]  I think it turns out to be net income before tax.\n",
            "[00:15:27,010 --> 00:15:28,010]  I think that is the impact.\n",
            "[00:15:28,010 --> 00:15:32,340]  Okay, thank you.\n",
            "[00:15:32,340 --> 00:15:34,780]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:15:34,780 --> 00:15:37,780]  Next question comes from Mr. Dutta from RBS Singapore.\n",
            "[00:15:37,780 --> 00:15:40,880]  Please go ahead.\n",
            "[00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:41,880]  Hi, thanks for the call.\n",
            "[00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:43,880]  I have three questions.\n",
            "[00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:49,880]  First, what is the timetable in your viewpoint in terms of integrating KBRO into your books?\n",
            "[00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:54,880]  Second question I had is with regard to your PayTV subscriber base.\n",
            "[00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:59,880]  What percent of that would actually be impacted by the price cap reduction?\n",
            "[00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:05,880]  Is there any implications on KBRO's areas as well?\n",
            "[00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:12,880]  Last question I had is with regard to the NCC's mandatory price cuts.\n",
            "[00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:15,880]  What do you think is the certainty of them pushing as is,\n",
            "[00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:26,100]  and what can you actually do or what are you doing to avert this?\n",
            "[00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:28,100]  I don't have a timetable.\n",
            "[00:16:28,100 --> 00:16:41,100]  Right now, we still don't know when the regulator is going to approve the deal.\n",
            "[00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:44,100]  We are still wrestling with the regulatory agencies.\n",
            "[00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:57,720]  Right now, I really don't have a very clear timetable when we are going to integrate KBRO into our book.\n",
            "[00:16:57,720 --> 00:17:02,720]  I will leave the rest of the questions to Rosie.\n",
            "[00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:14,720]  On the KBRO fee reduction announcement made by NCC, it will not affect our own operating areas.\n",
            "[00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:16,720]  It will only affect KBRO.\n",
            "[00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:32,870]  About 39% of KBRO's subscriber base will be affected.\n",
            "[00:17:32,870 --> 00:17:36,870]  Last question with regard to the tariff changes.\n",
            "[00:17:36,870 --> 00:17:38,030]  Sorry?\n",
            "[00:17:38,030 --> 00:17:39,030]  Sorry.\n",
            "[00:17:39,030 --> 00:17:45,030]  The last question I had pertained to the tariff changes on the mobile side.\n",
            "[00:17:45,030 --> 00:17:48,030]  What can you actually do in order to mitigate this?\n",
            "[00:17:48,030 --> 00:17:53,030]  Is there any negotiation ongoing with the NCC?\n",
            "[00:17:53,030 --> 00:18:00,640]  We rather not talk about this because this is not something to be talked about directly.\n",
            "[00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:03,020]  Understood.\n",
            "[00:18:03,020 --> 00:18:09,340]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:18:09,340 --> 00:18:10,340]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:18:10,340 --> 00:18:12,340]  Next question comes from D.Cero from SA Hong Kong.\n",
            "[00:18:12,340 --> 00:18:14,500]  Please go ahead.\n",
            "[00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:15,500]  Hi, guys.\n",
            "[00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:16,500]  Thanks very much for the call.\n",
            "[00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:17,500]  Just two questions.\n",
            "[00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:23,500]  The first one being on the operating expenses in the year.\n",
            "[00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:25,500]  You're down 6%.\n",
            "[00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:26,500]  That's quite a good effort.\n",
            "[00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:29,500]  Just wondering, within that, what was the sort of drivers there?\n",
            "[00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:33,500]  What was the areas of the business you were able to cut costs in?\n",
            "[00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:35,500]  And what can we expect going forward?\n",
            "[00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:38,500]  Will that sort of run rate be continued into 2010?\n",
            "[00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:42,500]  The second question I had was on more on the regulation corporate law reforms.\n",
            "[00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:51,500]  I know the FSC in Taiwan is looking at making distributions from legal reserve and capital surplus a lot simpler.\n",
            "[00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:52,500]  Do you have any update on that?\n",
            "[00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:57,500]  And if those go through, will you be changing your policy around capital management?\n",
            "[00:18:57,500 --> 00:19:01,520]  Thanks very much.\n",
            "[00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:13,800]  I think on the corporate law amendment, I think we're looking at the second half this year or?\n",
            "[00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:19,540]  Second.\n",
            "[00:19:19,540 --> 00:19:20,540]  What?\n",
            "[00:19:20,540 --> 00:19:23,540]  I think ultimately it's the second half this year.\n",
            "[00:19:23,540 --> 00:19:24,540]  Second half.\n",
            "[00:19:24,540 --> 00:19:25,540]  Second half.\n",
            "[00:19:25,540 --> 00:19:26,540]  Okay.\n",
            "[00:19:27,540 --> 00:19:34,540]  This thing is not in the legislative process.\n",
            "[00:19:34,540 --> 00:19:38,540]  And our legislators are very unpredictable.\n",
            "[00:19:38,540 --> 00:19:42,540]  So I must stress the word.\n",
            "[00:19:42,540 --> 00:19:50,580]  If we take an optimistic view, it's the second half this year.\n",
            "[00:19:50,580 --> 00:20:02,580]  And whether they will change our capital management policy or not, we actually do not know at this point.\n",
            "[00:20:02,580 --> 00:20:12,580]  But I do agree to not see a very aggressive capital reduction.\n",
            "[00:20:12,580 --> 00:20:20,980]  Okay.\n",
            "[00:20:20,980 --> 00:20:21,980]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:20:21,980 --> 00:20:24,980]  This question comes from Kathy Chan from Goldman Sachs Hong Kong.\n",
            "[00:20:24,980 --> 00:20:27,200]  Please go ahead.\n",
            "[00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:28,200]  Hi.\n",
            "[00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:29,200]  Thanks for the call.\n",
            "[00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:31,200]  I have three questions as well.\n",
            "[00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:34,200]  The first one is also on the KBRO acquisition.\n",
            "[00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:41,200]  Is there any update you can share in terms of the updated price for the acquisition?\n",
            "[00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:47,200]  Because if I remember correctly, since we passed the deadline now, there will be a new calculation for the last 12 months EBITDA.\n",
            "[00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:53,200]  The second question is on the CapEx and asset write-off guidance.\n",
            "[00:20:53,200 --> 00:21:01,200]  So for the CapEx guidance, is there anything you can share in terms of how much KBRO would add to the CapEx if the deal closes?\n",
            "[00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:10,200]  And then on the asset write-off side, I think in the prepared comments, you said that would be less than 2009, but is there a more concrete figure?\n",
            "[00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:15,200]  And then lastly, I just had a follow-up on the dividend for 2009 comment.\n",
            "[00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:20,200]  I think on the last call, you mentioned that you'll try to maintain a DPS of 4.2.\n",
            "[00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:22,200]  Is that still the board speaking?\n",
            "[00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:23,200]  Thanks.\n",
            "[00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:28,180]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:21:28,180 --> 00:21:38,180]  Cassie, on your third question, I think you are correct that we try to maintain.\n",
            "[00:21:38,180 --> 00:21:50,750]  What we're saying there is that with or without the deal, our dividend payment will not be affected.\n",
            "[00:21:51,750 --> 00:22:02,750]  If you look at our 4.6, the minus 10% reserve, that's roughly 4.2.\n",
            "[00:22:02,750 --> 00:22:04,750]  That's what we're saying.\n",
            "[00:22:04,750 --> 00:22:16,750]  I think you can say that it should not be less than that benchmark number.\n",
            "[00:22:16,750 --> 00:22:23,750]  But we haven't decided that whether it will be more or less.\n",
            "[00:22:23,750 --> 00:22:28,750]  That's something we're saying to be discussed at the April 4 meeting.\n",
            "[00:22:28,750 --> 00:22:36,330]  And I will leave the other two questions to Rosie.\n",
            "[00:22:36,330 --> 00:22:49,330]  On your CapEx question, this year we expect to incur $6.9 billion in CapEx, of which $4.7 billion is mobile-related.\n",
            "[00:22:49,330 --> 00:22:56,330]  And $1.6 billion is fixed-line related, and the rest are cable.\n",
            "[00:22:56,330 --> 00:23:10,360]  And on your first question of cable update on the valuation or price, their EBITDA is expected to grow on a month-to-month basis.\n",
            "[00:23:10,360 --> 00:23:20,360]  So we haven't really calculated the numbers yet because we haven't got their numbers yet.\n",
            "[00:23:20,360 --> 00:23:24,360]  It will be calculated on a last-12-month EBITDA basis.\n",
            "[00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:35,870]  But basically, their monthly EBITDA is growing at about $180 million a month on a month-on-month basis.\n",
            "[00:23:35,870 --> 00:23:38,540]  Okay, thanks.\n",
            "[00:23:38,540 --> 00:23:46,580]  Just to follow up on the CapEx side, do we have any guidance available for CapEx related to cable?\n",
            "[00:23:46,580 --> 00:23:51,580]  No, that number does not include any number for cable.\n",
            "[00:23:51,580 --> 00:24:03,920]  And we don't have a number from cable on their CapEx for this year yet.\n",
            "[00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:08,920]  Okay, and then just the last one I had was on the asset write-off guidance for this year.\n",
            "[00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:18,690]  It will be $1.5 billion for this year.\n",
            "[00:24:18,690 --> 00:24:19,690]  Okay, thank you.\n",
            "[00:24:19,690 --> 00:24:22,870]  You're welcome.\n",
            "[00:24:22,870 --> 00:24:23,870]  Thank you once again, ladies and gentlemen.\n",
            "[00:24:23,870 --> 00:24:26,870]  If you'd like to register for a question, please press the number 1 key now.\n",
            "[00:24:26,870 --> 00:24:31,850]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:24:31,850 --> 00:24:35,850]  Next question comes from Gary Yu from Morgan Stanley Hong Kong.\n",
            "[00:24:35,850 --> 00:24:36,850]  Please go ahead.\n",
            "[00:24:36,850 --> 00:24:37,850]  Hi, thanks for the call.\n",
            "[00:24:37,850 --> 00:24:40,850]  I just have one last question from my side.\n",
            "[00:24:40,850 --> 00:24:48,850]  Given the delay in cable acquisition, do you think the Carlyle Group will be entitled to their own nine dividends,\n",
            "[00:24:48,850 --> 00:24:55,200]  or it will likely be delayed after you declare a difference in April?\n",
            "[00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:57,200]  Sorry, can you repeat your question again?\n",
            "[00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:58,200]  Sure.\n",
            "[00:24:58,200 --> 00:25:02,200]  My question is more related to the cable acquisition\n",
            "[00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:05,200]  and how is it going to impact your dividends payout,\n",
            "[00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:12,200]  because if the transaction is going to be delayed after your dividend payout,\n",
            "[00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:18,200]  would that mean that Carlyle will not be entitled to your own nine dividends?\n",
            "[00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:25,200]  Well, it all depends on when the transaction will be closed.\n",
            "[00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:38,180]  If they are closed before the ex-dividend date, they are always entitled to it.\n",
            "[00:25:38,180 --> 00:25:47,620]  And if there's a need, because I pretty much presume that the previous deal was agreed based on the assumption\n",
            "[00:25:47,620 --> 00:25:50,620]  that Carlyle will be entitled to their own nine dividends,\n",
            "[00:25:50,620 --> 00:25:54,620]  because the initial expectation of completion was by the end of last year.\n",
            "[00:25:54,620 --> 00:26:00,620]  Would that be any impact on your transaction price or any of the terms of the transaction?\n",
            "[00:26:00,620 --> 00:26:01,620]  No.\n",
            "[00:26:01,620 --> 00:26:04,740]  Okay, thanks.\n",
            "[00:26:04,740 --> 00:26:14,340]  Kathy, going back to your question on the price that we are to pay to Cable,\n",
            "[00:26:14,340 --> 00:26:18,340]  sorry, the $180 million a month is ten times already.\n",
            "[00:26:18,340 --> 00:26:23,340]  So EBITDA is growing at about $18 million a month.\n",
            "[00:26:23,340 --> 00:26:27,420]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:26:27,420 --> 00:26:28,420]  One second, ladies and gentlemen.\n",
            "[00:26:28,420 --> 00:26:31,420]  If you'd like to register for a question, please press the number one key now.\n",
            "[00:26:31,420 --> 00:26:32,420]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:26:32,420 --> 00:26:40,100]  Next, we have a question from D. Sarah from CRSA Hong Kong.\n",
            "[00:26:40,100 --> 00:26:41,100]  Please go ahead.\n",
            "[00:26:41,100 --> 00:26:42,100]  Hi, good day, guys.\n",
            "[00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:43,100]  Sorry about my question.\n",
            "[00:26:43,100 --> 00:26:44,100]  Previously it wasn't answered.\n",
            "[00:26:44,100 --> 00:26:49,100]  Just had a follow-up one on the expenses, because you did quite a good job.\n",
            "[00:26:49,100 --> 00:26:55,100]  In fact, a very impressive job on cutting operating expenses in the year down 6%.\n",
            "[00:26:55,100 --> 00:26:59,100]  I'm just wondering, is that expected to be a similar run rate for 2010?\n",
            "[00:26:59,100 --> 00:27:05,100]  And what are the sort of initiatives being undertaken in the business to cut costs\n",
            "[00:27:05,100 --> 00:27:07,100]  and whereabouts are they?\n",
            "[00:27:07,100 --> 00:27:12,610]  And can you give me a bit more detail on that, please?\n",
            "[00:27:12,610 --> 00:27:27,820]  That's the end of the question.\n",
            "[00:27:27,820 --> 00:27:34,510]  Oh, my gosh.\n",
            "[00:27:34,510 --> 00:27:45,600]  First, I think I must clarify that we, in 2009,\n",
            "[00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:56,600]  the first half there was this financial crisis that contributed by everybody knows who.\n",
            "[00:27:57,600 --> 00:28:03,760]  So there was a little bit of costs.\n",
            "[00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:04,760]  It's not cutting.\n",
            "[00:28:04,760 --> 00:28:13,460]  It's a cost-sharp reduction mode.\n",
            "[00:28:13,460 --> 00:28:21,460]  And that stopped, I think, the end of the first half.\n",
            "[00:28:21,460 --> 00:28:26,460]  Actually, that is not the only result.\n",
            "[00:28:26,460 --> 00:28:33,460]  There are other results due to better than expected, better ratio,\n",
            "[00:28:33,460 --> 00:28:40,460]  and also we have better control of our retention,\n",
            "[00:28:40,460 --> 00:28:46,460]  and hence the subsidy expenses and all that.\n",
            "[00:28:46,460 --> 00:28:54,870]  This is sort of we do whatever we can when we see an opportunity to do so.\n",
            "[00:28:54,870 --> 00:29:06,030]  But for this coming year, we are basically not in a cost-reduction environment.\n",
            "[00:29:06,030 --> 00:29:12,030]  We look to increase our acquisition numbers.\n",
            "[00:29:12,030 --> 00:29:19,030]  And meanwhile, of course, I think after these years, particularly last year,\n",
            "[00:29:19,030 --> 00:29:26,030]  we should know that we are very, very cost and expenses conscientious.\n",
            "[00:29:26,030 --> 00:29:30,030]  So we will still try to deliver a good number,\n",
            "[00:29:30,030 --> 00:29:36,030]  but I don't think there's a cost-reduction runway there.\n",
            "[00:29:36,030 --> 00:29:45,320]  I think if we continue to do that, our sales and marketing people will raise hell with me.\n",
            "[00:29:45,320 --> 00:29:51,280]  Okay.\n",
            "[00:29:51,280 --> 00:29:52,280]  Okay, great.\n",
            "[00:29:52,280 --> 00:29:55,170]  Thank you very much for that.\n",
            "[00:29:55,170 --> 00:29:56,170]  One second, ladies and gentlemen.\n",
            "[00:29:56,170 --> 00:30:05,920]  That is the number one key for questions.\n",
            "[00:30:05,920 --> 00:30:06,920]  One second, ladies and gentlemen.\n",
            "[00:30:06,920 --> 00:30:08,920]  That is the number one key for questions.\n",
            "[00:30:08,920 --> 00:30:24,430]  Excuse me, Rosie, there seems to be no further questions at this point in time.\n",
            "[00:30:24,430 --> 00:30:27,680]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:30:27,680 --> 00:30:29,680]  Okay, if there's no further questions,\n",
            "[00:30:29,680 --> 00:30:34,680]  I just want to thank you all for attending this conference call.\n",
            "[00:30:34,680 --> 00:30:43,680]  And I also wish you all that have a very happy new year for the year 2010.\n",
            "[00:30:43,680 --> 00:30:44,680]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:30:44,680 --> 00:30:45,680]  Thank you.\n",

            "[00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:06,000]  Good morning, good evening, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to Taiwan Mobile Conference Call on 3rd Quarter Results.\n",
            "[00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,000]  Our chairperson today is Mr. Harvey Lee and we have Ms. Rosie Yu as the speaker.\n",
            "[00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:17,860]  Mr. Chairman, Ms. Yu, please begin your call and I'll be standing by for your question and answer session. Thank you.\n",
            "[00:00:17,860 --> 00:00:25,860]  Okay, thank you. Thanks everyone and welcome to our this quarter's conference call.\n",
            "[00:00:25,860 --> 00:00:31,860]  Before we started, I would like to direct your attention to page 2 of our handout,\n",
            "[00:00:31,860 --> 00:00:39,860]  which says the information contained in this presentation, including all forward-looking information subject to change without notice,\n",
            "[00:00:39,860 --> 00:00:43,860]  whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise,\n",

            "[00:00:56,860 --> 00:01:01,790]  or reliability of the information contained herein,\n",

            "[00:01:11,020 --> 00:01:19,180]  And with that out of the way, we will begin this quarter's presentation.\n",
            "[00:01:19,180 --> 00:01:24,180]  And you see that the basic outline is the same.\n",
            "[00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:32,980]  And I will direct your attention to page 4, which gives you a summary of our last quarter's results.\n",
            "[00:01:32,980 --> 00:01:41,980]  Our last quarter revenue reached $17.4 billion, which remained at a stable quarter-over-quarter\n",
            "[00:01:41,980 --> 00:01:47,140]  and down 1% on a year-over-year basis.\n",
            "[00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:56,140]  The lower-than-expected mobile subscriber acquisition cost and the good GIA expense control resulted in better-than-expected\n",
            "[00:01:56,140 --> 00:02:02,190]  third-quarter EBITDA, exceeding our guidance by 1%.\n",
            "[00:02:02,190 --> 00:02:10,190]  On the non-operating front, as network optimization was slightly ahead of our schedule,\n",
            "[00:02:10,190 --> 00:02:18,190]  $470 million of asset write-off losses happened in the third quarter this year,\n",
            "[00:02:18,190 --> 00:02:22,190]  which exceeded our guidance by $82 million.\n",
            "[00:02:22,190 --> 00:02:29,190]  We estimate a full-year write-off loss will be around $1.7 billion.\n",
            "[00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:38,540]  To sum up, our third quarter net income reached 101% of the guidance number\n",
            "[00:02:38,540 --> 00:02:46,770]  and the net profit for the first nine months of the year totaled $10.37 billion,\n",
            "[00:02:46,770 --> 00:02:57,980]  or $80.39 on EPF basis, reaching 75% of our full-year target.\n",
            "[00:02:57,980 --> 00:03:02,980]  The next page will tell you about our original performances.\n",
            "[00:03:02,980 --> 00:03:06,980]  First, let's take a look at our consumer business.\n",
            "[00:03:06,980 --> 00:03:11,980]  In the third quarter, our consumer business recorded a sequential improvement\n",
            "[00:03:11,980 --> 00:03:16,980]  and narrowed year-over-year decline in revenue.\n",
            "[00:03:16,980 --> 00:03:21,980]  But mobile voice revenue weaknesses and the more companies store open\n",
            "[00:03:21,980 --> 00:03:29,980]  and the higher advertising expenses to promote new rate plans and the launch of new BlackBerry\n",
            "[00:03:29,980 --> 00:03:36,620]  and Android phones has a negative impact on our EBITDA.\n",
            "[00:03:36,620 --> 00:03:47,650]  On our household business, we continue to grow our pay TV content and broadband business\n",
            "[00:03:47,650 --> 00:03:57,650]  and the HBG reported a healthy 2% quarter-over-quarter 15% year-over-year increase in EBITDA.\n",
            "[00:03:57,650 --> 00:04:07,650]  It is noteworthy that the cable broadband EBITDA margin expanded to 43.7% this quarter\n",
            "[00:04:07,650 --> 00:04:14,870]  from 28% a year ago due to economy of scale.\n",
            "[00:04:14,870 --> 00:04:21,870]  And then for our enterprise business, our EBG mobile revenue remains stable on a year-over-year basis\n",
            "[00:04:21,870 --> 00:04:28,030]  while our fixed line revenue dropped year-over-year during the third quarter.\n",
            "[00:04:28,030 --> 00:04:41,360]  That said, the EBG still reported a year-over-year growth attributable to OPEC's savings.\n",
            "[00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:45,360]  On the next page, we will take a look at the comparison.\n",
            "[00:09:27,950 --> 00:09:35,950]  Billions of cash inflows were from selling treasury shares to employees in the same quarter.\n",
            "[00:09:35,950 --> 00:09:44,950]  The quarter-on-quarter rise in third quarter free cash flow was the result of escalated operating cash inflows\n",
            "[00:09:44,950 --> 00:09:48,950]  and lower cash tax as just mentioned earlier.\n",
            "[00:09:48,950 --> 00:09:53,950]  Here today, our free cash flow reached 11 billion.\n",
            "[00:09:53,950 --> 00:09:59,950]  Let me turn this over back to Harvey for third quarter guidance.\n",
            "[00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:12,240]  For this quarter, we expect the cable-related revenue and the profits to trend up on a sequential basis\n",
            "[00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:18,240]  and to record double-digit year-over-year growth.\n",
            "[00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:29,660]  This is primarily caused by continuous growth in pay TV, content distribution, and the cable broadband business.\n",
            "[00:10:29,660 --> 00:10:38,660]  Mobile revenue this quarter is not expected to further trend up from third quarter due to seasonality,\n",
            "[00:10:38,660 --> 00:10:44,750]  but it's estimated to be resilient compared to the level a year ago.\n",
            "[00:10:44,750 --> 00:10:51,980]  Operating expenses control will lead to a positive year-over-year growth in EBITDA this quarter.\n",
            "[00:10:54,420 --> 00:11:02,420]  As to our fixed network, EBITDA generated by a fixed network this quarter is expected to be stable\n",
            "[00:11:02,420 --> 00:11:13,700]  on a quarter-over-quarter basis and have a small year-over-year increase due to the expense control.\n",
            "[00:11:13,700 --> 00:11:27,430]  Our main non-op item in fourth quarter will be asset write-off losses around 366 million.\n",
            "[00:11:27,430 --> 00:11:37,620]  And for the full year, we expect net profit to be around NT$13.9 billion\n",
            "[00:11:37,620 --> 00:11:49,500]  and on EPS terms will be $4.67, which are in line with third quarter guidance.\n",
            "[00:11:49,500 --> 00:12:06,450]  And if you turn over to the next page, just give you a quick update on this acquisition of cable deal\n",
            "[00:12:06,450 --> 00:12:16,200]  that we have filed with the Fair Trade Commission on October the 9th.\n",
            "[00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:19,000]  That's about three weeks ago.\n",
            "[00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:26,000]  And we are now in communication with them and are waiting for their approval.\n",
            "[00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:37,600]  So I think this year, again, that we won the A-plus award on information disclosure and transparency assessment\n",
            "[00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:41,210]  conducted by Securities and Futures Institute.\n",
            "[00:12:41,210 --> 00:12:47,740]  This is the fourth year, four times in a row we won this award\n",
            "[00:12:47,740 --> 00:12:52,980]  and also demonstrate that our commitment to transparency.\n",
            "[00:12:52,980 --> 00:13:04,190]  Our key message for this quarter is basically that we expect that we'll be able to meet the guidance for a year\n",
            "[00:13:04,190 --> 00:13:15,540]  for existing business and then that we look forward to receive approvals from the regulatory body\n",
            "[00:13:16,630 --> 00:13:27,790]  on this acquisition deal so that we have more platform to work out to further increase our shareholder return.\n",
            "[00:13:27,790 --> 00:13:35,110]  And that concludes my presentation.\n",
            "[00:13:35,110 --> 00:13:39,830]  I would be happy to take...\n",
            "[00:13:39,830 --> 00:13:40,830]  Thank you, sir.\n",
            "[00:13:40,830 --> 00:13:42,830]  And we are now polling for questions.\n",
            "[00:13:42,830 --> 00:13:47,830]  Ladies and gentlemen, if you would like to register for questions, please press number one on your telephone touchpad.\n",
            "[00:13:47,830 --> 00:13:52,180]  Once again, it's number one key to register for questions.\n",
            "[00:13:52,180 --> 00:13:56,280]  Our first question comes from Ms. Cathy Chen from Goldman Sachs Hong Kong.\n",
            "[00:13:56,280 --> 00:13:57,280]  Please go ahead.\n",
            "[00:13:57,280 --> 00:13:58,280]  Hi.\n",
            "[00:13:58,280 --> 00:13:59,280]  Thanks for taking my question.\n",
            "[00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:02,280]  I have three questions I'd like to start off with.\n",
            "[00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:06,280]  Firstly, in terms of the comment about shareholder returns,\n",
            "[00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:12,280]  can you give us an update on what the board is thinking about capital management outlook\n",
            "[00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:15,280]  in terms of dividends we paid from 2009 earnings,\n",
            "[00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:20,280]  given that with the Capro acquisition closing end of this year,\n",
            "[00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:23,280]  presumably there will be a hit to the dividend returns,\n",
            "[00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:25,280]  given that those shares won't be foregoing dividends.\n",
            "[00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:30,280]  So there's any update on whether or not we can see some buffering as a result of that.\n",
            "[00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:34,280]  The second question is on the Capro broadband EBITDA margins.\n",
            "[00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:40,280]  In the prepared comments, you mentioned that the third quarter EBITDA margins have gone up to 44%.\n",
            "[00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:47,280]  Can you share some color on how much higher this could continue to go as you gain more scale on the broadband side?\n",
            "[00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:51,630]  And then lastly, on the regulatory side,\n",
            "[00:14:51,630 --> 00:14:55,630]  can you give us an update on discussions with the regulators regarding the price cap\n",
            "[00:14:55,630 --> 00:14:57,630]  as we're heading into the end of the year?\n",
            "[00:14:57,630 --> 00:14:58,630]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:14:58,630 --> 00:15:10,250]  Cathy, I'm afraid that I really don't have much to share with you on your third question.\n",
            "[00:15:11,250 --> 00:15:25,980]  I think you will agree that we certainly would not like to see that they lower the price cap on the Capro rates.\n",
            "[00:15:25,980 --> 00:15:37,980]  But this is very fragmented because it varies from each operating region.\n",
            "[00:15:37,980 --> 00:15:40,980]  So really we don't have that much to share with you.\n",
            "[00:15:40,980 --> 00:15:48,070]  And we certainly will work out and try to retain what we have.\n",
            "[00:15:48,070 --> 00:15:52,700]  On the capital management,\n",
            "[00:15:52,700 --> 00:16:03,990]  I think we have indicated that for the year 2009, if the deal goes through,\n",
            "[00:16:03,990 --> 00:16:10,820]  certainly we will, I think, make up the difference.\n",
            "[00:16:11,820 --> 00:16:17,530]  So we will basically keep the up.\n",
            "[00:16:17,530 --> 00:16:23,530]  We will not let this deal impact our dividend payments for the year.\n",
            "[00:16:23,530 --> 00:16:32,620]  So you can certainly expect that without this deal,\n",
            "[00:16:32,620 --> 00:16:40,740]  if the amount of dividend that is going to be paid out, I think that will be our commitment.\n",
            "[00:16:40,740 --> 00:16:45,740]  And when we get to next year, the board will get to discuss this.\n",
            "[00:16:45,740 --> 00:16:53,940]  And whether we will be able to have more aggressive capital management activities,\n",
            "[00:16:53,940 --> 00:17:00,940]  I think we need to take a further look after the deal is done\n",
            "[00:17:00,940 --> 00:17:07,970]  because the consolidated balance sheet will look quite different.\n",
            "[00:17:07,970 --> 00:17:11,000]  Since the Capro is highly leveraged,\n",
            "[00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:24,330]  so I don't think that we will be able to do too much until we have a closer look at the situation.\n",
            "[00:17:24,330 --> 00:17:35,140]  On the Capro broadband, I tend to be conservative.\n",
            "[00:17:35,140 --> 00:17:41,880]  I think that we have done, our team has done an excellent job\n",
            "[00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:48,930]  in terms of the dividend margin to mid-40 dividend margin level.\n",
            "[00:17:48,930 --> 00:18:04,900]  Probably there won't be too much up from where we have already.\n",
            "[00:18:04,900 --> 00:18:10,900]  But if we are able to provide the service to more of the operating areas.\n",
            "[00:18:10,900 --> 00:18:16,220]  Okay, thank you.\n",
            "[00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:18,220]  Just to follow up on the dividend comment,\n",
            "[00:18:18,220 --> 00:18:24,580]  so are you saying that you are trying to maintain the absolute dividend level from last year\n",
            "[00:18:24,580 --> 00:18:29,580]  or should we just assume that there is some net profit decline for the full year this year,\n",
            "[00:18:29,580 --> 00:18:33,580]  so there will be maximum dividend payout from that lower earnings level\n",
            "[00:18:33,580 --> 00:18:38,580]  plus the buffer from the dividends, sorry, the treasury shares for going dividends?\n",
            "[00:18:38,580 --> 00:18:41,580]  I'm not saying that it's not a comparison with last year.\n",
            "[00:18:41,580 --> 00:18:47,580]  It's a comparison with where we are now.\n",
            "[00:18:47,580 --> 00:18:52,580]  So basically, yeah, they are some profit decline.\n",
            "[00:18:52,580 --> 00:18:56,580]  So if you calculate that,\n",
            "[00:18:56,580 --> 00:19:05,580]  you will see that the cash dividend level will not be the same as it was before.\n",
            "[00:19:05,580 --> 00:19:11,580]  But that does not say that we are not going to pay anything higher than that.\n",
            "[00:19:11,580 --> 00:19:13,580]  That's up to the board.\n",
            "[00:19:13,580 --> 00:19:20,580]  We haven't really gotten into that discussion yet because we need to wait until.\n",
            "[00:19:20,580 --> 00:19:24,580]  We just want to make sure that if the deal actually went through,\n",
            "[00:19:24,580 --> 00:19:28,580]  I think there are a lot of things to be reassessed.\n",
            "[00:19:28,580 --> 00:19:32,090]  So right now, I don't really have a good answer for you.\n",
            "[00:19:32,090 --> 00:19:33,630]  Okay, thanks.\n",
            "[00:19:33,630 --> 00:19:43,560]  So not letting the deal impact the dividend payment means more the treasury share buffering difference, right?\n",
            "[00:19:43,560 --> 00:19:44,560]  Yeah.\n",
            "[00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:45,560]  Okay, thank you.\n",
            "[00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:48,770]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:19:48,770 --> 00:19:51,770]  And our next question comes from Mr. Jimmy Chung from J.P. Morgan Hong Kong.\n",
            "[00:19:51,770 --> 00:19:53,800]  Please go ahead.\n",
            "[00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:54,800]  Thanks for the call.\n",
            "[00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:55,800]  I have two questions.\n",
            "[00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:59,800]  Could you provide us with a view on when this change in the Taiwan company law\n",
            "[00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:04,800]  to enable the higher payout ratios will pass the legislative?\n",
            "[00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:09,800]  I recall your IR team gave me some guidance maybe a couple of months ago.\n",
            "[00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:11,800]  I was just wondering if there's any update to that.\n",
            "[00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:15,800]  And if so, if you expect it to pass through in 2010,\n",
            "[00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:19,800]  would this be the lever you use to buffer the dividend?\n",
            "[00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:23,800]  The second question is could there be some downside to four-year CapEx numbers?\n",
            "[00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:28,800]  I think you previously guided $6.5 billion Taiwan for this year,\n",
            "[00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:33,800]  and to meet that you would need to spend about $2.3 billion, $2.4 billion in the fourth quarter,\n",
            "[00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:37,800]  which would make it one of the highest quarterly CapEx numbers for a number of years.\n",
            "[00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:42,800]  Is there something earmarked for a large CapEx payment in the fourth quarter,\n",
            "[00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:53,780]  or could we possibly see, say, half a billion to a billion in CapEx come below guidance?\n",
            "[00:20:53,780 --> 00:21:00,810]  On the possible revision of corporate act in Taiwan,\n",
            "[00:21:00,810 --> 00:21:05,810]  we don't know when it will be passed by the legislative.\n",
            "[00:21:05,810 --> 00:21:10,810]  But currently the bill has passed the first reading,\n",
            "[00:21:10,810 --> 00:21:13,810]  but it's the second reading that really counts.\n",
            "[00:21:13,810 --> 00:21:19,840]  We are still waiting for the legislature to give the approval.\n",
            "[00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:25,840]  And on your second question, our four-year CapEx guidance was $6.5 billion,\n",
            "[00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:30,840]  and as of the end of third quarter, it's already $4.8 billion.\n",
            "[00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:37,840]  So I'm not quite sure why you have this $2.3 billion number.\n",
            "[00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:42,840]  That's the amount you would need to spend in the fourth quarter to get to $6.5 billion.\n",
            "[00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:48,840]  No, it should be $1.7 billion, $6.5 billion minus $4.8 billion.\n",
            "[00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:56,100]  Okay, maybe we restated some first or second quarter numbers that are different from what I have.\n",
            "[00:21:56,100 --> 00:21:58,100]  So I'll double-check that. Thanks.\n",
            "[00:21:58,100 --> 00:21:59,100]  Yes.\n",
            "[00:21:59,100 --> 00:22:17,900]  Thank you. And can we go to the next question?\n",
            "[00:22:17,900 --> 00:22:30,660]  This operator, can we go to the next question?\n",
            "[00:22:30,660 --> 00:22:32,970]  Yes.\n",
            "[00:22:32,970 --> 00:22:36,890]  Okay, thank you.\n",
            "[00:22:36,890 --> 00:22:39,890]  Our next question comes from Mr. Gary Yu from Morgan Stanley Hong Kong.\n",
            "[00:22:39,890 --> 00:22:42,560]  Please go ahead.\n",
            "[00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:43,560]  Okay, thanks for the call.\n",
            "[00:22:43,560 --> 00:22:46,560]  I've got three questions from my side.\n",
            "[00:22:46,560 --> 00:22:50,560]  The first question is a follow-up to Kathy's question on dividends.\n",
            "[00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:57,560]  So if I assume our Tama Mobile achieves a full-year EPS of $4.67 for 2009,\n",
            "[00:22:57,560 --> 00:23:04,560]  putting a 90% payout for dividends, is that the amount that you will be committing to,\n",
            "[00:23:04,560 --> 00:23:09,560]  which is the $4.2 per share for dividends for a full year?\n",
            "[00:23:09,560 --> 00:23:13,560]  The second question I have is regarding your cable acquisition.\n",
            "[00:23:13,560 --> 00:23:15,560]  Do you expect any goodwill?\n",
            "[00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:20,560]  And if so, what is the expected amount that you will record on the balance sheet?\n",
            "[00:23:20,560 --> 00:23:24,560]  And the third question is for your remaining treasury shares.\n",
            "[00:23:24,560 --> 00:23:28,560]  Do you have any near-term plan for that?\n",
            "[00:23:28,560 --> 00:23:31,560]  Because that's still 5%, 6% of the total share count.\n",
            "[00:23:31,560 --> 00:23:34,230]  Thanks.\n",
            "[00:23:34,230 --> 00:23:39,230]  Gary, you are correct in your assumption in your first question.\n",
            "[00:23:40,710 --> 00:23:45,710]  And as for the remaining treasury shares, frankly speaking,\n",
            "[00:23:45,710 --> 00:23:49,710]  right now we are busy with the acquisition transaction.\n",
            "[00:23:49,710 --> 00:23:55,000]  I don't think we have the energy to entertain that.\n",
            "[00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:58,160]  Actually, we also have no plans for the time being.\n",
            "[00:23:58,160 --> 00:24:03,260]  As far as the goodwill number, I'll let Rosie give it to you.\n",
            "[00:24:03,260 --> 00:24:14,260]  Currently on Cable's book, the total goodwill amounts to $36 billion roughly.\n",
            "[00:24:14,260 --> 00:24:21,830]  And because of the transaction, there will be $20 billion more.\n",
            "[00:24:21,830 --> 00:24:29,020]  So that's the number you are asking about.\n",
            "[00:24:29,020 --> 00:24:32,020]  If I can follow up on the treasury shares question,\n",
            "[00:24:32,020 --> 00:24:39,020]  for the remaining 5%, 6%, are you also going to forego dividends from 2010 onwards?\n",
            "[00:24:39,020 --> 00:24:40,020]  Oh, yeah.\n",
            "[00:24:40,020 --> 00:24:45,020]  If you said that they remain unforegoed, I would think we'll continue to forego dividends.\n",
            "[00:24:45,020 --> 00:24:46,020]  Okay, thanks.\n",
            "[00:24:46,020 --> 00:24:51,080]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:24:51,080 --> 00:24:55,180]  And our next question comes from Arthur from RBS Singapore.\n",
            "[00:24:55,180 --> 00:24:57,340]  Please go ahead.\n",
            "[00:24:57,340 --> 00:24:58,340]  Thank you for the call.\n",
            "[00:24:58,340 --> 00:24:59,340]  I have two questions.\n",
            "[00:24:59,340 --> 00:25:04,340]  One common theme coming up in the Taiwanese market is the potential for cross-border investments\n",
            "[00:25:04,340 --> 00:25:05,340]  between Taiwan and China.\n",
            "[00:25:05,340 --> 00:25:11,340]  I was just wondering if Taiwan Mobile plans to participate in this, and if so, in what form?\n",
            "[00:25:11,340 --> 00:25:14,340]  The second question I have is with regard to competition.\n",
            "[00:25:14,340 --> 00:25:17,340]  Do you actually see this as potentially stiffening in the fourth quarter?\n",
            "[00:25:17,340 --> 00:25:23,340]  I understand that your competitor initially had expected a more competitive environment in the third quarter,\n",
            "[00:25:23,340 --> 00:25:28,340]  but had to scale back due to inventory problems, which has since been addressed.\n",
            "[00:25:28,340 --> 00:25:33,780]  Do you see risk of them ramping up activities in the fourth quarter?\n",
            "[00:25:33,780 --> 00:25:40,780]  The competition actually has never died down, I think, in this market.\n",
            "[00:25:40,780 --> 00:25:47,780]  But on the other hand, I also don't see that we are really going into a cut-throat competition.\n",
            "[00:25:47,780 --> 00:25:53,780]  It might happen in some small segments, but on an overall basis,\n",
            "[00:25:53,780 --> 00:25:58,780]  I think we'll be continuing intense competition among the operators,\n",
            "[00:25:59,780 --> 00:26:06,000]  but I don't see anybody really try to jump the gun and get everybody killed.\n",
            "[00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:16,040]  On the cross-border investment, the answer is actually we don't know.\n",
            "[00:26:16,040 --> 00:26:22,650]  We are not really that knowledgeable about the China market.\n",
            "[00:26:22,650 --> 00:26:30,740]  We pay attention to it, and I personally visit China often these days,\n",
            "[00:26:30,740 --> 00:26:38,970]  and touch with people to try to get some cooperation going.\n",
            "[00:26:38,970 --> 00:26:43,970]  But whether this will really lead us to cross-border investment,\n",
            "[00:26:43,970 --> 00:26:51,970]  either in the major operators or in other upstream or downstream business,\n",
            "[00:26:51,970 --> 00:26:58,050]  actually we don't know. I guess it may be.\n",
            "[00:26:58,050 --> 00:27:05,670]  Got it. Thank you.\n",
            "[00:27:05,670 --> 00:27:07,670]  Thank you once again, ladies and gentlemen.\n",
            "[00:27:07,670 --> 00:27:14,740]  If you would like to register for a question, please press 1.\n",
            "[00:27:14,740 --> 00:27:18,740]  If you have a follow-up question, please come from Ms. Cathy Chen from Goldman Sachs Hong Kong.\n",
            "[00:27:18,740 --> 00:27:19,770]  Please go ahead.\n",
            "[00:27:19,770 --> 00:27:21,770]  Hi. Thanks for taking my questions again.\n",
            "[00:27:21,770 --> 00:27:24,770]  Just two follow-up questions from my side.\n",
            "[00:27:24,770 --> 00:27:29,770]  Just to check on the fourth quarter revenue guidance, in terms of each segment,\n",
            "[00:27:29,770 --> 00:27:31,770]  if I'm reading the text correctly,\n",
            "[00:27:31,770 --> 00:27:36,770]  you basically expect that the consumer business group revenue will be flat quarter-on-quarter,\n",
            "[00:27:36,770 --> 00:27:38,770]  and then for the enterprise business group,\n",
            "[00:27:38,770 --> 00:27:40,770]  you say stable quarter-on-quarter for EBITDA,\n",
            "[00:27:40,770 --> 00:27:45,800]  but do you expect that the revenue will also be stable quarter-on-quarter?\n",
            "[00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:49,800]  And then secondly, on the KPERS side,\n",
            "[00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:59,880]  is there any update in terms of quantifying more of the synergies from the deal they expect to materialize next year?\n",
            "[00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:05,880]  I'll let Rosie talk about this, but before we get the transaction approved,\n",
            "[00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:11,880]  we are not that excited about trying to quantify all those synergies,\n",
            "[00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:15,980]  but what has to come will come.\n",
            "[00:28:15,980 --> 00:28:20,100]  That's my philosophy for the time being.\n",
            "[00:28:20,100 --> 00:28:21,100]  Yeah.\n",
            "[00:28:21,100 --> 00:28:28,190]  Cathy, on your EBT revenue, would it be stable quarter-on-quarter?\n",
            "[00:28:28,190 --> 00:28:30,190]  Maybe yes,\n",
            "[00:28:30,190 --> 00:28:37,220]  but the fixed line business is still declining,\n",
            "[00:28:37,220 --> 00:28:47,220]  so we are counting more on expense controls to keep the EBITDA in line with our guidance,\n",
            "[00:28:47,220 --> 00:28:53,220]  and we expect to see the expense control continuing into the fourth quarter.\n",
            "[00:28:53,220 --> 00:28:56,690]  Okay, great.\n",
            "[00:28:56,690 --> 00:29:00,690]  I guess then that implies that the cable revenue you expect for fourth quarter is quite strong, right?\n",
            "[00:29:00,690 --> 00:29:04,230]  So up something like 8% quarter-on-quarter?\n",
            "[00:29:04,230 --> 00:29:09,620]  Yeah, that's our guidance, yes.\n",
            "[00:29:09,620 --> 00:29:10,620]  Okay.\n",
            "[00:29:10,620 --> 00:29:11,620]  All right, thanks.\n",
            "[00:29:11,620 --> 00:29:14,700]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:29:14,700 --> 00:29:17,700]  And our next question is coming from Ms. Shirley Lee from UBS Hong Kong.\n",
            "[00:29:17,700 --> 00:29:18,700]  Please go ahead.\n",
            "[00:29:18,700 --> 00:29:20,700]  Hi, thanks very much for taking my questions.\n",
            "[00:29:20,700 --> 00:29:23,700]  My first question relates to the minutes of use.\n",
            "[00:29:23,700 --> 00:29:26,700]  I noticed that the number of minutes has come off in the third quarter,\n",
            "[00:29:26,700 --> 00:29:29,700]  even though our tariff per minute has increased.\n",
            "[00:29:30,700 --> 00:29:36,700]  I was wondering if that was because of some changes in your tariffs on price packages\n",
            "[00:29:36,700 --> 00:29:41,700]  or you're seeing that people are actually using less their mobile phones.\n",
            "[00:29:41,700 --> 00:29:44,700]  Secondly, you mentioned something about the fixed broadband\n",
            "[00:29:44,700 --> 00:29:47,700]  or the cable broadband margins have improved.\n",
            "[00:29:47,700 --> 00:29:51,700]  I was wondering if you have started breaking out the mobile broadband margins\n",
            "[00:29:51,700 --> 00:29:55,700]  versus your mobile margins and how that has been trending.\n",
            "[00:29:56,700 --> 00:29:57,700]  And finally,\n",
            "[00:29:57,700 --> 00:30:04,700]  I noticed there was some recent press reports about potential to cut cable tariffs within the Taipei area.\n",
            "[00:30:04,700 --> 00:30:10,420]  I was wondering if you have any comments on that.\n",
            "[00:30:10,420 --> 00:30:15,420]  I really don't know what comments we can make on the cable tariffs in Taipei.\n",
            "[00:30:15,420 --> 00:30:23,220]  Currently, we're not operating in that region.\n",
            "[00:30:23,220 --> 00:30:33,300]  At this point, we really ‚Äì each year I think we always face that risk, I guess.\n",
            "[00:30:33,300 --> 00:30:44,650]  And on the minutes of use, actually they are ‚Äì starting last year,\n",
            "[00:30:44,650 --> 00:30:48,650]  we have noticed actually some declining.\n",
            "[00:30:48,650 --> 00:30:55,690]  It also depends on which segment.\n",
            "[00:30:55,690 --> 00:31:06,000]  The most obvious declining I think coming from one is the pre-pay.\n",
            "[00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:13,430]  And because I think that's the one segment,\n",
            "[00:31:13,430 --> 00:31:21,100]  I think we have a more intensifying competition among the operators.\n",
            "[00:31:22,100 --> 00:31:32,090]  The rest, I guess, is really ‚Äì I don't see anything particularly noteworthy,\n",
            "[00:31:32,090 --> 00:31:34,090]  and maybe Rosie can comment on that.\n",
            "[00:31:34,090 --> 00:31:39,600]  Yeah, actually the three-minute users,\n",
            "[00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:47,600]  actually the bucket plan users actually reduced their usage of three minutes.\n",
            "[00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:55,600]  So that's also causing the slower than expected growth in MOU.\n",
            "[00:31:55,600 --> 00:32:07,710]  Actually, for non-bucket plan users, their usage has come up.\n",
            "[00:32:07,710 --> 00:32:15,000]  And mobile ‚Äì no, no, no, mobile broadband margin, we don't ‚Äì sorry,\n",
            "[00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:27,690]  we still don't have the mobile broadband even a margin for you at this moment.\n",
            "[00:32:27,690 --> 00:32:28,690]  Okay, thank you.\n",
            "[00:32:28,690 --> 00:32:31,830]  Thank you once again.\n",
            "[00:32:31,830 --> 00:32:56,540]  Again, ladies and gentlemen, to register for questions, please press 1.\n",
            "[00:32:56,540 --> 00:32:57,540]  Excuse me, Mr. Chen,\n",
            "[00:32:57,540 --> 00:33:00,540]  it seems to be no further questions at this point in time.\n",
            "[00:33:00,540 --> 00:33:02,790]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:33:02,790 --> 00:33:10,790]  Okay, if there are no more questions, we will adjourn this session.\n",
            "[00:33:10,790 --> 00:33:15,790]  And thank you all for attending our conference call.\n",
            "[00:33:15,790 --> 00:33:17,790]  And we'll talk to you again next quarter.\n",
            "[00:33:17,790 --> 00:33:19,790]  Thank you, and bye-bye.\n",

            "[00:01:31,370 --> 00:02:00,390]  If you turn to the slide of result summary, as you can see that we met our second quarter early due to VG service.\n",
            "[00:02:00,390 --> 00:02:08,360]  Our second quarter, this is primarily due to marketing expense.\n",
            "[00:02:12,850 --> 00:02:37,150]  On the non-operating items, validation was slightly behind schedule, so R84 million, which is lower than...\n",

            "[00:06:50,330 --> 00:07:05,620]  As to our 3G postpaid subscriber number, in the second quarter, they exceeded the making up.\n",
            "[00:07:05,620 --> 00:07:17,410]  Our 3G data revenue was up from a year ago.\n",
            "[00:07:17,410 --> 00:07:31,530]  If you look at our 3G device adoption now, 41% of our 3G devices is up two times.\n",
            "[00:07:31,530 --> 00:07:42,960]  I think these are all fairly satisfactory results.\n",
            "[00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:56,700]  And now with quick performances, I will turn the mic over to Rosie to talk about our financials.\n",
            "[00:07:56,700 --> 00:08:06,700]  The second quarter cash level rose sequentially from the previous quarter on the back of stable operating cash flow.\n",
            "[00:08:06,700 --> 00:08:10,740]  If you look at our balance sheet analysis,\n",
            "[00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:17,740]  net property, plan and equipment balance at the end of second quarter was down sequentially.\n",
            "[00:08:17,740 --> 00:08:25,740]  The 2G network value was reduced to $19 billion as of the end of second quarter.\n",
            "[00:08:25,740 --> 00:08:34,740]  On the liability side, growth debt reduced to $15.5 billion from $16 billion a quarter ago\n",
            "[00:08:34,740 --> 00:08:39,740]  because we paid down half a billion of short-term borrowing.\n",
            "[00:08:39,740 --> 00:08:53,740]  On the current liabilities, other current liabilities increased quarter over quarter in second quarter\n",
            "[00:08:53,740 --> 00:09:01,740]  largely from the $14 billion cash dividend payable which was paid on July 24th.\n",
            "[00:09:02,900 --> 00:09:18,990]  We had $12.37 billion of capital surplus and $13.9 billion legal reserve on our balance sheet\n",
            "[00:09:18,990 --> 00:09:31,730]  which could be the source of cash dividend for the future if Taiwan's legislation passed the revision of the Company Act.\n",
            "[00:09:31,730 --> 00:09:39,730]  Additionally, we had $2.27 billion unappropriated earnings and $3.35 billion special reserve\n",
            "[00:09:39,730 --> 00:09:47,730]  which have been used partially to top up our cash dividend received in July this year.\n",
            "[00:09:47,730 --> 00:09:52,730]  If you look at our cash flow analysis on the next page,\n",
            "[00:09:52,730 --> 00:09:58,730]  our man operating cash flow in the quarter was affected by the payment of corporate income tax\n",
            "[00:09:58,730 --> 00:10:02,730]  which was non-event in the first quarter of 2009.\n",
            "[00:10:02,730 --> 00:10:10,730]  As cash payment of corporate income tax in first half was result of taxable income of the previous year,\n",
            "[00:10:10,730 --> 00:10:20,730]  taxable income in 08 is much higher than that in 07 because of the huge asset write downs in 07.\n",
            "[00:10:20,730 --> 00:10:26,730]  This resulted in lower operating cash inflows in second quarter of 2009.\n",
            "[00:10:26,730 --> 00:10:31,760]  On the investing cash flow, it was mainly for CapEx.\n",
            "[00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:43,050]  In terms of financing activities, we repaid short-term borrowings of half a billion in this quarter as previously mentioned.\n",
            "[00:10:44,050 --> 00:10:58,050]  Some 0.36 billion cash inflows were from the sale of treasury shares to employees in the second quarter of 2009.\n",
            "[00:10:58,050 --> 00:11:04,340]  I will turn this over back to Harvey for third quarter forecast.\n",
            "[00:11:04,340 --> 00:11:15,330]  Let's look at our third quarter forecast number.\n",
            "[00:11:16,330 --> 00:11:24,740]  Our mobile and cable related service revenue is expected to edge up on a substantial basis\n",
            "[00:11:24,740 --> 00:11:31,370]  containing a year-over-year revenue drop in third quarter.\n",
            "[00:11:31,370 --> 00:11:38,260]  Adding in content aggregation cost to the third quarter guidance,\n",
            "[00:11:38,260 --> 00:11:45,140]  our higher revenue and utility cost of base stations,\n",
            "[00:11:45,140 --> 00:11:49,140]  that means that our cost will be down on a year-over-year basis.\n",
            "[00:11:49,140 --> 00:12:00,210]  Due to the expense, we expect to sign up more new subscribers this quarter,\n",
            "[00:12:00,210 --> 00:12:04,750]  leading to a quarter-over-quarter rise in selling expense.\n",
            "[00:12:04,750 --> 00:12:20,890]  Also, however, we will continue our SG&A to achieve our main non-operating item in third quarter,\n",
            "[00:12:20,890 --> 00:12:32,500]  expected $80,300.\n",
            "[00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:45,690]  The next page just gives you event update of the regulatory fund and the peer update.\n",
            "[00:12:45,690 --> 00:13:02,750]  The first one is the China Mobile, not seeing any.\n",
            "[00:13:02,750 --> 00:13:13,820]  The second is our CHT, the IP peering price.\n",
            "[00:13:14,980 --> 00:13:46,820]  And then the cabinet has proposed a revision of the company by lowering the strategy distribution approval.\n",
            "[00:13:46,820 --> 00:14:07,500]  And then also our legislative run has passed the income tax and reduced corporate statutory 2010.\n",

            "[00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:24,540]  There is a survey done here in Taiwan.\n",
            "[00:14:32,300 --> 00:14:41,110]  They have done Taiwan Mobile.\n",
            "[00:14:41,110 --> 00:15:09,830]  And then this is from the Reader's Digest that this is for.\n",
            "[00:15:09,830 --> 00:15:41,710]  Our key message for this quarter is that with ongoing HBG business together,\n",
            "[00:15:41,710 --> 00:15:53,320]  I think overspending expected to help us to third quarter guidance.\n",
            "[00:15:53,320 --> 00:16:05,790]  With that, we'll be happy to take.\n",
            "[00:16:05,790 --> 00:16:06,790]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:16:06,790 --> 00:16:08,790]  Ladies and gentlemen, we will now open for questions.\n",
            "[00:16:08,790 --> 00:16:12,790]  If you'd like to register for a question, please press the number one key now.\n",
            "[00:16:12,790 --> 00:16:15,810]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:16:15,810 --> 00:16:21,500]  Once again, ladies and gentlemen, that is the number one key for questions.\n",
            "[00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:24,500]  Our first question comes from Mr. Anna Ravichandran of Citigroup.\n",
            "[00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:25,500]  Please go ahead.\n",
            "[00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:26,500]  Yes, hi.\n",
            "[00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:27,500]  Good afternoon.\n",
            "[00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:28,500]  Thank you so much for this call.\n",
            "[00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:30,500]  I had actually three questions.\n",
            "[00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:36,500]  First, Junko Telecom's third quarter guidance did come as a surprise to the market\n",
            "[00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:41,540]  and it talked about much higher handset subsidies for the third quarter.\n",
            "[00:16:41,540 --> 00:16:46,540]  So my question is that does that mean the market environment could worsen\n",
            "[00:16:46,540 --> 00:16:53,890]  and are any assumptions related to that reflected in this third quarter guidance of yours at all?\n",
            "[00:16:53,890 --> 00:16:59,890]  Second question is on the cabinet proposal to lower the threshold of dividend distribution\n",
            "[00:16:59,890 --> 00:17:01,890]  and capital surplus and legal reserve.\n",
            "[00:17:01,890 --> 00:17:05,890]  If that is passed, does that change the way you think about capital management?\n",
            "[00:17:05,890 --> 00:17:11,890]  And I ask this simply because you already have enough buffer to pay on top of what is the solid yield.\n",
            "[00:17:11,890 --> 00:17:15,890]  So does that mean that you have some incentive to pay out more?\n",
            "[00:17:15,890 --> 00:17:19,890]  I mean, does it really change anything for Taiwan Mobile because the buffer was already there?\n",
            "[00:17:19,890 --> 00:17:22,890]  And my third question is on taxes.\n",
            "[00:17:22,890 --> 00:17:29,890]  As tax rates go down from 25% to 20%, should we straightaway look at all that benefit coming through to the P&L\n",
            "[00:17:29,890 --> 00:17:34,890]  or is there something else we should be aware of in terms of any deferred credits or liabilities?\n",
            "[00:17:34,890 --> 00:17:39,170]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:17:39,170 --> 00:17:50,170]  On the CHT third quarter guidance, we, of course, also quickly have caught our attention\n",
            "[00:17:50,170 --> 00:17:59,170]  that they have posed a much higher handset subsidy.\n",
            "[00:17:59,170 --> 00:18:05,480]  I can't say that this does not imply there will be more intensive,\n",
            "[00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:10,780]  but I can certainly tell you that we don't intend to do the same thing.\n",
            "[00:18:10,780 --> 00:18:16,290]  For them, I think because they have made a lot of commitments,\n",
            "[00:18:16,290 --> 00:18:30,780]  I think there are certain pressures on CHT and who, as usual, really believe in market share.\n",
            "[00:18:30,780 --> 00:18:34,920]  So they have to pay a price for that.\n",
            "[00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:48,060]  Secondly, on the dividend distribution, it is true that once the new law has been passed,\n",
            "[00:18:48,060 --> 00:18:50,060]  we do have a buffer.\n",
            "[00:18:50,060 --> 00:18:59,310]  It might change how we look at capital.\n",
            "[00:18:59,310 --> 00:19:10,670]  But right now, we don't have any specific thoughts in terms of how we're going to do this.\n",
            "[00:19:12,470 --> 00:19:27,620]  Certainly, I think the third one on the tax, maybe Rosie can talk about that.\n",
            "[00:19:27,620 --> 00:19:35,620]  It will lower our tax expense from next year on.\n",
            "[00:19:35,620 --> 00:19:46,620]  But for this year, there might be some impact because of the lowered rate upcoming starting next year.\n",
            "[00:19:47,620 --> 00:19:56,620]  But the impact will be mitigated by some of our tax buffers, which we have reserved already.\n",
            "[00:19:56,620 --> 00:20:00,390]  So the impact will be minimal.\n",
            "[00:20:00,390 --> 00:20:01,390]  For this year?\n",
            "[00:20:01,390 --> 00:20:03,390]  Yes, for this year.\n",
            "[00:20:03,390 --> 00:20:06,390]  From next year on, it's more positive.\n",
            "[00:20:06,390 --> 00:20:07,420]  Yes.\n",
            "[00:20:07,420 --> 00:20:11,420]  And just to confirm, your third quarter guidance is life is normal,\n",
            "[00:20:11,420 --> 00:20:29,410]  so it does not assume a more competitive market because Tsinghua does something?\n",
            "[00:20:29,410 --> 00:20:32,410]  I think yes and no.\n",
            "[00:20:32,410 --> 00:20:36,410]  Actually, we look at this handset market a little bit differently.\n",
            "[00:20:36,410 --> 00:20:45,360]  We still felt that they are clear segments in terms of the handsets.\n",
            "[00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:52,360]  Tsinghua is primarily trying to shift more people, say, in the middle tier to the high tier.\n",
            "[00:20:52,360 --> 00:21:01,820]  So that's why they're increasing there.\n",
            "[00:21:01,820 --> 00:21:05,260]  This is not going to be easy.\n",
            "[00:21:05,260 --> 00:21:06,260]  Okay, thank you so much.\n",
            "[00:21:06,260 --> 00:21:09,790]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:21:09,790 --> 00:21:12,790]  Our next question comes from Tim Story of JP Morgan Hong Kong.\n",
            "[00:21:12,790 --> 00:21:13,790]  Please go ahead.\n",
            "[00:21:13,790 --> 00:21:15,790]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:21:15,790 --> 00:21:21,800]  I have three questions as well to the state of the cable industry in Taiwan.\n",
            "[00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:32,110]  They have definitely happened, but they're starting to see a deal.\n",
            "[00:21:32,110 --> 00:21:35,110]  And I'm just wondering, given the environment that we're now in,\n",
            "[00:21:35,110 --> 00:21:38,110]  which is hopefully a recovery environment,\n",
            "[00:21:38,110 --> 00:21:44,110]  does that make it even more difficult for you to have expectations of being able to acquire further cable assets?\n",
            "[00:21:44,110 --> 00:21:46,110]  So that's the first question,\n",
            "[00:21:46,110 --> 00:21:50,110]  just what's your confidence in being able to execute on a cable transaction.\n",
            "[00:21:50,110 --> 00:21:57,110]  Secondly, and it's linked to that, if you're not able to acquire cable assets,\n",
            "[00:21:57,110 --> 00:22:01,110]  what's your strategy in terms of the Treasury shares?\n",
            "[00:22:01,110 --> 00:22:07,110]  Is there anything differently that you would do if you felt that there was no chance of doing an acquisition?\n",
            "[00:22:07,110 --> 00:22:10,110]  And then finally, more of an operational question,\n",
            "[00:22:10,110 --> 00:22:15,110]  is it possible to get a breakdown of CapEx for this year in terms of where the money is being spent?\n",
            "[00:22:15,110 --> 00:22:18,620]  Thanks.\n",
            "[00:22:18,620 --> 00:22:33,720]  The recovery of the economy, I think, changed the outlook, I think,\n",
            "[00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:42,860]  in terms of the cable industry revenue.\n",
            "[00:22:42,860 --> 00:22:56,580]  But we actually, we still tend, it turns out, this is never easy.\n",
            "[00:22:56,580 --> 00:23:05,630]  We really cannot tell you too much about it.\n",
            "[00:23:05,630 --> 00:23:31,120]  Certainly, right now, I don't think we are at a stage that we have right now, I think.\n",
            "[00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:39,120]  Basically, $4.7 billion will be earmarked for mobile-related business,\n",
            "[00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:48,750]  and about $1.2 billion for enterprise business groups, and about $0.6 billion for cable.\n",
            "[00:23:48,750 --> 00:23:49,750]  Thanks, Rosie.\n",
            "[00:23:49,750 --> 00:23:54,750]  Harvey, if I could just go back to the first two questions, just to follow on.\n",
            "[00:23:54,750 --> 00:24:03,300]  Is there anything on the regulatory front, things like the market cap, market share cap, for example,\n",
            "[00:24:03,300 --> 00:24:11,300]  that may be revisited by the government and may make transactions more justifiable,\n",
            "[00:24:11,300 --> 00:24:14,300]  that you feel is a very likely scenario?\n",
            "[00:24:14,300 --> 00:24:16,300]  I mean, these are all possible scenarios,\n",
            "[00:24:17,300 --> 00:24:19,300]  over the next year or two in terms of regulatory changes.\n",
            "[00:24:19,300 --> 00:24:20,300]  Is that at all out there?\n",
            "[00:24:20,300 --> 00:24:25,300]  And separately, I'm just curious about your thoughts on what Far Eastone has discussed\n",
            "[00:24:25,300 --> 00:24:29,300]  in terms of their strategy for diversification of revenues,\n",
            "[00:24:29,300 --> 00:24:33,300]  which seems to be buying into China-based value-added service companies,\n",
            "[00:24:33,300 --> 00:24:37,300]  and albeit the relationship with China Mobile is there on the one hand,\n",
            "[00:24:37,300 --> 00:24:40,300]  but that's not necessarily a requirement to do those types of investments.\n",
            "[00:24:40,300 --> 00:24:44,300]  Could you comment at all on Taiwan Mobile's interest in doing something outside of Taiwan,\n",
            "[00:24:44,300 --> 00:24:47,300]  perhaps along the lines of Far Eastone or something completely different?\n",
            "[00:24:47,300 --> 00:24:49,300]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:24:49,300 --> 00:24:59,300]  The regulatory change, I think, will offer more of a plain level view in terms of competition.\n",
            "[00:24:59,300 --> 00:25:10,490]  So I think that as far as we are concerned, we'd love to see that change taking place.\n",
            "[00:25:11,490 --> 00:25:15,490]  But before it's taking place, I don't think we will be somehow bonded\n",
            "[00:25:15,490 --> 00:25:17,490]  and we'll not be able to do anything.\n",
            "[00:25:17,490 --> 00:25:27,820]  I think we will still try to do that.\n",
            "[00:25:27,820 --> 00:25:33,820]  As to Far Eastone, I have to tell you that we try not to make comments on our competitors\n",
            "[00:25:33,820 --> 00:25:38,740]  so that we're not in the business of pleasing them,\n",
            "[00:25:38,740 --> 00:25:43,740]  but we also don't try to be in the position to offend them.\n",
            "[00:25:43,740 --> 00:25:51,680]  Are you making acquisitions outside of Taiwan?\n",
            "[00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:58,680]  We have actually looked at several markets in the past\n",
            "[00:25:58,680 --> 00:26:04,030]  and have not seen anything that's really appealing to us.\n",
            "[00:26:04,030 --> 00:26:09,030]  I think we still remain to be interested,\n",
            "[00:26:09,030 --> 00:26:15,140]  but I think we will be selective in making acquisitions.\n",
            "[00:26:15,140 --> 00:26:19,740]  Thank you very much for your help.\n",
            "[00:26:19,740 --> 00:26:20,740]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:26:20,740 --> 00:26:22,740]  Our next question comes from Tando of GIC Singapore.\n",
            "[00:26:22,740 --> 00:26:25,410]  Please go ahead.\n",
            "[00:26:25,410 --> 00:26:26,410]  Hi, good afternoon.\n",
            "[00:26:26,410 --> 00:26:29,410]  I've got one question on the IP peering rates.\n",
            "[00:26:29,410 --> 00:26:36,410]  Would you be able to tell us what the rates are that CHT has agreed now versus the old rates\n",
            "[00:26:36,410 --> 00:26:41,080]  and what would be the financial effect on Taiwan mobile?\n",
            "[00:26:41,080 --> 00:26:53,690]  We had an NDA among us that was not determined when they finally agreed to a more favorable rate\n",
            "[00:26:54,690 --> 00:27:01,990]  as well as a rate that I'm afraid I cannot really give you the specific.\n",
            "[00:27:01,990 --> 00:27:10,850]  It is helpful to us, but it's not going to make us rich by doing that, but it is helpful in terms of.\n",
            "[00:27:10,850 --> 00:27:14,950]  All right.\n",
            "[00:27:14,950 --> 00:27:15,950]  Okay.\n",
            "[00:27:15,950 --> 00:27:19,540]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:27:19,540 --> 00:27:20,540]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:27:20,540 --> 00:27:22,540]  This question comes from Kathy Chan of Goldman Sachs in Hong Kong.\n",
            "[00:27:22,540 --> 00:27:23,540]  Please go ahead.\n",
            "[00:27:23,540 --> 00:27:24,540]  Hi, thanks for the call.\n",
            "[00:27:24,540 --> 00:27:26,540]  I have three questions.\n",
            "[00:27:26,540 --> 00:27:28,540]  Firstly, on the third quarter guidance,\n",
            "[00:27:28,540 --> 00:27:33,540]  can you give us some breakdown in terms of revenues among the three different segments\n",
            "[00:27:33,540 --> 00:27:39,540]  where we're seeing more improvement in terms of quarter-on-quarter or year-on-year growth?\n",
            "[00:27:39,540 --> 00:27:43,540]  Secondly, in terms of the recent Star TV agreement,\n",
            "[00:27:43,540 --> 00:27:48,540]  could you talk a little bit more about your content aggregation strategy going forward?\n",
            "[00:27:48,540 --> 00:27:54,540]  How should we expect the amount of content aggregation you do evolve over time?\n",
            "[00:27:54,540 --> 00:27:58,540]  And then lastly, on the digital TV side, can you give us an update on the rollout?\n",
            "[00:27:58,540 --> 00:28:02,540]  And looking a few years out, when can we expect the revenues to become more meaningful?\n",
            "[00:28:02,540 --> 00:28:05,820]  Thanks.\n",
            "[00:28:05,820 --> 00:28:14,820]  Let me talk about the Star TV content aggregation as well as the digital TV.\n",
            "[00:28:14,820 --> 00:28:20,240]  These are primarily all the content business,\n",
            "[00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:33,500]  and we are quite happy that we are finally able to reach agreement with folks in Hong Kong to start TV.\n",
            "[00:28:33,500 --> 00:28:41,540]  As far as our overall content aggregation strategy is concerned,\n",
            "[00:28:41,540 --> 00:28:50,980]  we in the past were not a significant player in the content aggregation business,\n",
            "[00:28:50,980 --> 00:29:06,630]  but I think starting this year that we decided to shift gears and be more active in the content aggregation.\n",
            "[00:29:06,630 --> 00:29:15,190]  So Star TV, I think, is the first step that is able to successfully.\n",
            "[00:29:15,190 --> 00:29:29,510]  We will strive to win more content aggregation agencies from other content players\n",
            "[00:29:29,510 --> 00:29:35,470]  so that it gives us a more competitive position.\n",
            "[00:29:35,470 --> 00:29:49,040]  On the digital TV, we launched our service on July 1st in two of our service areas.\n",
            "[00:29:49,040 --> 00:30:00,210]  The first month of July, I would say so far so good.\n",
            "[00:30:00,210 --> 00:30:11,780]  We see some favorable response from our cable TV subscribers.\n",
            "[00:30:13,330 --> 00:30:23,120]  But it will take a while.\n",
            "[00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:28,120]  Cathy, on the revenue guidance for third quarter,\n",
            "[00:30:28,120 --> 00:30:38,150]  we expect to see the growth coming from wireless broadband and cable primarily.\n",
            "[00:30:38,150 --> 00:30:45,150]  The mobile revenue is expected to go up about 1% quarter over quarter.\n",
            "[00:30:45,150 --> 00:30:52,150]  The battery-added service together will go up about 28% year over year.\n",
            "[00:30:52,150 --> 00:30:56,760]  So these are our expectations.\n",
            "[00:30:56,760 --> 00:30:57,760]  Okay.\n",
            "[00:30:57,760 --> 00:31:06,460]  And then is fixed line during the quarter EBG increasing year on year in the quarter or decreasing?\n",
            "[00:31:06,460 --> 00:31:07,490]  EBG?\n",
            "[00:31:07,490 --> 00:31:08,490]  Yeah.\n",
            "[00:31:08,490 --> 00:31:13,650]  I think EBG is on the flat to upward trend.\n",
            "[00:31:13,650 --> 00:31:14,810]  Okay.\n",
            "[00:31:14,810 --> 00:31:15,810]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:31:15,810 --> 00:31:19,660]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:31:19,660 --> 00:31:20,660]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:31:20,660 --> 00:31:22,660]  Next question comes from Neil Anderson of HSBC Hong Kong.\n",
            "[00:31:22,660 --> 00:31:23,660]  Please go ahead.\n",
            "[00:31:23,660 --> 00:31:24,690]  Hi.\n",
            "[00:31:24,690 --> 00:31:25,690]  Thanks very much.\n",
            "[00:31:25,690 --> 00:31:30,690]  Just three queries related to the data card growth Taiwan Mobile is seeing.\n",
            "[00:31:30,690 --> 00:31:37,230]  Firstly, on the subsidy side, are you more focused on smartphones or wireless broadband\n",
            "[00:31:37,230 --> 00:31:40,230]  or data card connections in the third quarter?\n",
            "[00:31:40,230 --> 00:31:43,710]  And secondly, specifically on wireless broadband,\n",
            "[00:31:43,710 --> 00:31:48,710]  are you seeing more interest in netbook bundles or standalone data cards?\n",
            "[00:31:48,710 --> 00:31:51,130]  And finally, the third question,\n",
            "[00:31:51,130 --> 00:31:55,130]  obviously there's quite a bit of growth coming through now from this service.\n",
            "[00:31:55,130 --> 00:31:58,130]  Are you seeing a material impact on both radio capacity\n",
            "[00:31:58,130 --> 00:32:02,130]  and backhaul as a result of the growth in wireless broadband?\n",
            "[00:32:02,130 --> 00:32:04,960]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:12,630]  I'm not sure I completely understand, but Roswell helped me to complement my answers.\n",
            "[00:32:13,630 --> 00:32:24,630]  Primarily I see that because we took a lead on providing the netbook to our customers,\n",
            "[00:32:24,630 --> 00:32:27,630]  that has really built up the momentum.\n",
            "[00:32:27,630 --> 00:32:35,630]  And so far I still tend to think that because our strategy to subsidize the netbook\n",
            "[00:32:35,630 --> 00:32:39,630]  has won a lot of customers.\n",
            "[00:32:39,630 --> 00:32:49,540]  I expect that trend actually continues for a while.\n",
            "[00:32:49,540 --> 00:32:52,540]  That's primarily what I see here.\n",
            "[00:32:52,540 --> 00:32:56,940]  Josie, do you have anything to add on that?\n",
            "[00:32:56,940 --> 00:33:03,940]  On the data card issue which affected our radio capacity,\n",
            "[00:33:03,940 --> 00:33:07,940]  that will increase our burden a bit.\n",
            "[00:33:07,940 --> 00:33:18,940]  But we have already started changing our backhaul to be more IP-based to lower the burden.\n",
            "[00:33:18,940 --> 00:33:29,980]  We have sort of a two-year plan in terms of consolidating,\n",
            "[00:33:29,980 --> 00:33:35,260]  in terms of restructuring our overall backhaul\n",
            "[00:33:36,870 --> 00:33:46,740]  to try to use more IP transmission than the traditional ATM type.\n",
            "[00:33:46,740 --> 00:33:51,300]  That plan is ongoing.\n",
            "[00:33:51,300 --> 00:33:58,740]  Certainly I think this is part of our network cost management.\n",
            "[00:33:58,740 --> 00:33:59,740]  Okay, thanks very much.\n",
            "[00:33:59,740 --> 00:34:04,740]  Just to follow up, my first point I guess was regarding the subsidies.\n",
            "[00:34:04,740 --> 00:34:07,740]  Do you see more of that going towards data cards and netbooks,\n",
            "[00:34:07,740 --> 00:34:13,830]  or is it really a handset focus in the third quarter?\n",
            "[00:34:13,830 --> 00:34:16,830]  The netbook I think has accounted for a significant part,\n",
            "[00:34:16,830 --> 00:34:19,930]  and it will probably continue that way.\n",
            "[00:34:19,930 --> 00:34:21,930]  Right, I see. Thanks very much.\n",
            "[00:34:21,930 --> 00:34:27,380]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:34:27,380 --> 00:34:30,380]  Next question comes from Arthur Binetta of RBS in Singapore.\n",
            "[00:34:30,380 --> 00:34:31,380]  Go ahead.\n",
            "[00:34:31,380 --> 00:34:32,980]  Hi, thank you.\n",
            "[00:34:32,980 --> 00:34:33,980]  I have two questions.\n",
            "[00:34:33,980 --> 00:34:35,980]  Firstly, with regard to your guidance,\n",
            "[00:34:35,980 --> 00:34:41,980]  given the likely increase in subsidies by Chunghwa Telecom in the third quarter,\n",
            "[00:34:41,980 --> 00:34:47,980]  don't you see pressure that there will be need to actually match this on the part of Taiwan Mobile,\n",
            "[00:34:47,980 --> 00:34:52,980]  unless you want to face subscriber migration?\n",
            "[00:34:52,980 --> 00:34:55,980]  Has this been factored into your margins as well?\n",
            "[00:34:55,980 --> 00:34:58,980]  Second question I have is with regard to the cable acquisition.\n",
            "[00:34:58,980 --> 00:35:00,980]  This has been discussed for quite a while as well.\n",
            "[00:35:00,980 --> 00:35:03,980]  Is there a deadline for you to actually walk away from such a deal\n",
            "[00:35:03,980 --> 00:35:09,980]  and actually explore other areas of investment or cash return?\n",
            "[00:35:09,980 --> 00:35:17,960]  Well, I think we're foolish to set a deadline for us to do that.\n",
            "[00:35:17,960 --> 00:35:21,850]  So there is no deadline.\n",
            "[00:35:21,850 --> 00:35:24,850]  As to, I think we have already talked about a subsidy thing.\n",
            "[00:35:24,850 --> 00:35:29,850]  Basically, we look at the thing a little bit differently.\n",
            "[00:35:29,850 --> 00:35:38,480]  We tend to think they are clear customer segmentation.\n",
            "[00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:43,480]  So we are not going to copy what CHT is doing.\n",
            "[00:35:43,480 --> 00:35:49,390]  So you're not too concerned that there may be some migration\n",
            "[00:35:49,390 --> 00:35:52,680]  as a result of them trying to migrate customer sub as well?\n",
            "[00:35:52,680 --> 00:35:53,680]  Yeah, there will be.\n",
            "[00:35:53,680 --> 00:36:01,680]  But we will try to use other marketing schemes to counter that.\n",
            "[00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:05,220]  But we are not going to copy what they're going to do,\n",
            "[00:36:05,220 --> 00:36:12,870]  that is to dramatically increase of the handset subsidy.\n",
            "[00:36:12,870 --> 00:36:13,870]  Understood. Thank you.\n",
            "[00:36:13,870 --> 00:36:17,400]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:20,400]  Next question comes from Shirley T of UPS Hong Kong.\n",
            "[00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:21,400]  Please go ahead.\n",
            "[00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:22,400]  Hi, thanks very much for the call.\n",
            "[00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:23,400]  I have three questions.\n",
            "[00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:26,400]  First, I just wanted to confirm on your forecast\n",
            "[00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:32,400]  that the Star TV aggregation is not within the Q3 forecast right now.\n",
            "[00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:33,400]  And if we add that in,\n",
            "[00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:38,400]  that would be accretive to both the revenue and EBITDA for your Q3 numbers.\n",
            "[00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:41,400]  And secondly, it sounds from your answers earlier\n",
            "[00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:44,400]  that you are looking to become a bigger player\n",
            "[00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:46,400]  in the content aggregation side.\n",
            "[00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:48,400]  And I recall that one of the key rationale\n",
            "[00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:51,400]  for doing a cable acquisition in the past\n",
            "[00:36:51,400 --> 00:36:53,400]  was that you wanted to derive more synergies\n",
            "[00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:57,400]  from maybe content costs savings.\n",
            "[00:36:57,400 --> 00:37:00,400]  Does this mean that if you succeed in this new strategy\n",
            "[00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:05,400]  that the priority in terms of doing cable acquisition could come off?\n",
            "[00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:11,400]  And thirdly, on the better margins from lower selling expenses,\n",
            "[00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:14,400]  how much of that was due to subscriber net\n",
            "[00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:16,400]  as coming in lower than your expectation\n",
            "[00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:21,580]  versus a lower subscriber acquisition cost per sale?\n",
            "[00:37:21,580 --> 00:37:23,580]  Can I be brief to your answer?\n",
            "[00:37:23,580 --> 00:37:25,580]  The first question is yes.\n",
            "[00:37:25,580 --> 00:37:28,580]  The second question is no.\n",
            "[00:37:28,580 --> 00:37:32,810]  And the third no is also no.\n",
            "[00:37:32,810 --> 00:37:36,810]  Of course, actually, it's not because of lower.\n",
            "[00:37:36,810 --> 00:37:39,810]  Of course, I think we try to exercise some discipline\n",
            "[00:37:39,810 --> 00:37:44,220]  in terms of acquiring customers, but that is not.\n",
            "[00:37:44,220 --> 00:37:51,450]  I think that actually it's really how we manage our customers.\n",
            "[00:37:51,450 --> 00:37:57,660]  The chair management, I think we did a better job.\n",
            "[00:37:57,660 --> 00:38:00,660]  Maybe just a very quick follow-up on the number one question.\n",
            "[00:38:00,660 --> 00:38:01,660]  Okay.\n",
            "[00:38:01,660 --> 00:38:03,660]  If the margin on the Star TV business,\n",
            "[00:38:03,660 --> 00:38:05,660]  will you be able to give us some color on that?\n",
            "[00:38:05,660 --> 00:38:08,660]  Is that quite low compared to your overall margins?\n",
            "[00:38:08,660 --> 00:38:09,660]  Of course, of course.\n",
            "[00:38:09,660 --> 00:38:15,660]  You do think that we are highway robbers or that we can't do that?\n",
            "[00:38:15,660 --> 00:38:22,660]  It is not a fat margin business, but I think it helps us to position ourselves.\n",
            "[00:38:22,660 --> 00:38:25,100]  Okay, great.\n",
            "[00:38:25,100 --> 00:38:26,100]  Thanks very much.\n",
            "[00:38:26,100 --> 00:38:33,100]  Shirley, on the subsidies, I'm sorry, on the selling expense, right,\n",
            "[00:38:33,100 --> 00:38:39,100]  the quantity decline is about 11%, quarter over quarter.\n",
            "[00:38:39,100 --> 00:38:51,940]  And the price decline is about 10%.\n",
            "[00:38:51,940 --> 00:38:52,940]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:38:52,940 --> 00:38:55,940]  Our next question comes from John Kim of Merrill Lynch in Korea.\n",
            "[00:38:55,940 --> 00:38:58,740]  Please go ahead.\n",
            "[00:38:58,740 --> 00:39:01,740]  Yes, thank you very much for the opportunity to ask questions.\n",
            "[00:39:01,740 --> 00:39:03,740]  I have two.\n",
            "[00:39:03,740 --> 00:39:09,740]  First one, regarding your macro outlook, if the macro conditions improve,\n",
            "[00:39:09,740 --> 00:39:14,740]  would it be fair for us to expect Taiwan Mobile's operating profit to recover\n",
            "[00:39:14,740 --> 00:39:20,740]  to some extent next year, or do you feel like other factors such as competition\n",
            "[00:39:20,740 --> 00:39:26,740]  intensifying that this is going to offset your earnings recovery\n",
            "[00:39:26,740 --> 00:39:29,740]  and we cannot expect a meaningful rebound?\n",
            "[00:39:29,740 --> 00:39:32,740]  I'm not looking for a number, but, you know,\n",
            "[00:39:32,740 --> 00:39:35,740]  some guidance and direction would be very helpful.\n",
            "[00:39:35,740 --> 00:39:40,740]  And then second question, if you can just provide some rough guidance\n",
            "[00:39:40,740 --> 00:39:44,740]  or idea on your asset write-off for the next year or two, that would be great.\n",
            "[00:39:44,740 --> 00:39:47,760]  Thanks.\n",
            "[00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:52,980]  All this is probably going to be quite vague.\n",
            "[00:39:52,980 --> 00:40:00,980]  If our operating structure remains status quo,\n",
            "[00:40:01,980 --> 00:40:08,080]  that means there's no significant acquisition concluded and all that.\n",
            "[00:40:08,080 --> 00:40:15,750]  I actually don't think that you will see a significant rebound in terms of operating profit.\n",
            "[00:40:15,750 --> 00:40:23,210]  Operating profit did not drop that much because it slowed down the economy.\n",
            "[00:40:23,210 --> 00:40:25,210]  It didn't drop that much.\n",
            "[00:40:25,210 --> 00:40:30,130]  We really don't see that as well.\n",
            "[00:40:30,130 --> 00:40:43,330]  And then on the asset write-off, at this point, we also don't see the significant rebound.\n",
            "[00:40:44,330 --> 00:40:46,900]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:40:46,900 --> 00:40:49,900]  Once again, ladies and gentlemen, if you'd like to register for a question,\n",
            "[00:40:49,900 --> 00:40:51,900]  please press the number one key now.\n",
            "[00:40:51,900 --> 00:40:52,900]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:40:52,900 --> 00:40:58,940]  This question comes from Helen Chew of Goldman Sachs in Hong Kong.\n",
            "[00:40:58,940 --> 00:40:59,940]  Please go ahead.\n",
            "[00:40:59,940 --> 00:41:01,940]  Hi. I actually have a couple of follow-up questions\n",
            "[00:41:01,940 --> 00:41:04,940]  to some of the topics that were already touched upon.\n",
            "[00:41:04,940 --> 00:41:09,940]  I think, first of all, following up on John's question regarding the economic recovery,\n",
            "[00:41:09,940 --> 00:41:12,940]  you said in the presentation that as the economy is improving,\n",
            "[00:41:12,940 --> 00:41:15,940]  the revenue is expected to stabilize.\n",
            "[00:41:15,940 --> 00:41:21,940]  I guess looking at some of the monthly data, the MOU has been reasonably stable,\n",
            "[00:41:21,940 --> 00:41:25,940]  and the main reason why there has been some revenue pressure on the mobile side\n",
            "[00:41:25,940 --> 00:41:29,940]  seems to be just that the price per minute has declined pretty significantly\n",
            "[00:41:29,940 --> 00:41:32,940]  since, let's say, 12 to 18 months ago.\n",
            "[00:41:32,940 --> 00:41:36,940]  So do you think that's a function of competition,\n",
            "[00:41:36,940 --> 00:41:38,940]  or do you think that's a function of economic recovery,\n",
            "[00:41:38,940 --> 00:41:44,940]  and do you expect that at the current level of 3.2, 3.3 NT per minute\n",
            "[00:41:44,940 --> 00:41:49,940]  that this is kind of reaching some kind of stable level\n",
            "[00:41:49,940 --> 00:41:53,940]  so that if you do have additional data ARPU contribution to that,\n",
            "[00:41:53,940 --> 00:42:00,250]  it would drive an inflection point in your mobile revenue?\n",
            "[00:42:00,250 --> 00:42:14,180]  Well, the drop in the revenue per minute is primarily a reflection of the company.\n",
            "[00:42:14,180 --> 00:42:18,180]  I don't think, I think that it is stabilizing.\n",
            "[00:42:20,370 --> 00:42:35,300]  But I don't see a significant inflection point that grows.\n",
            "[00:42:35,300 --> 00:42:36,300]  Okay.\n",
            "[00:42:36,300 --> 00:42:39,300]  But are you starting to see some signs that the overall usage,\n",
            "[00:42:39,300 --> 00:42:45,840]  the MOU is increasing because of the economic recovery?\n",
            "[00:42:45,840 --> 00:42:50,720]  Slightly.\n",
            "[00:42:50,720 --> 00:42:55,580]  And then I think you also mentioned the services contribution\n",
            "[00:42:55,580 --> 00:43:00,580]  and the contribution from data cards and netbooks and so on and so forth.\n",
            "[00:43:01,580 --> 00:43:05,580]  Since you're being more aggressive on that than some of your competitors,\n",
            "[00:43:05,580 --> 00:43:10,580]  what do you think is a reasonable target for your data ARPU contribution to revenue,\n",
            "[00:43:10,580 --> 00:43:13,580]  let's say, in the next, I don't know, one or two years?\n",
            "[00:43:13,580 --> 00:43:21,700]  And are you targeting to actually get to a higher percentage than Far East Zone?\n",
            "[00:43:21,700 --> 00:43:23,700]  Certainly that is the goal.\n",
            "[00:43:23,700 --> 00:43:43,550]  But do you think, like, 15% or high teens is a realistic one to two-year target?\n",
            "[00:43:43,550 --> 00:43:56,550]  According to our growth page of close to 30% in data, it's close to 15% next year already.\n",
            "[00:43:56,550 --> 00:43:59,180]  Okay.\n",
            "[00:43:59,180 --> 00:44:01,180]  So you do expect that the rate will continue, right?\n",
            "[00:44:01,180 --> 00:44:02,180]  Yes.\n",
            "[00:44:02,180 --> 00:44:03,920]  Okay.\n",
            "[00:44:03,920 --> 00:44:06,920]  And I guess just one more follow-up on that.\n",
            "[00:44:06,920 --> 00:44:14,680]  Are you saying that the payback period on the subsidy for the data cards\n",
            "[00:44:14,680 --> 00:44:19,680]  and netbooks is comparable to the normal handset?\n",
            "[00:44:19,680 --> 00:44:22,680]  I'm talking about subsidy as a percentage of the committed revenue.\n",
            "[00:44:22,680 --> 00:44:25,680]  So I understand that the duration of the contract is longer, you know,\n",
            "[00:44:25,680 --> 00:44:27,680]  like three years instead of two years.\n",
            "[00:44:27,680 --> 00:44:33,680]  But are you saying that the subsidy divided by the committed revenue over the three years,\n",
            "[00:44:33,680 --> 00:44:41,100]  that ratio is higher, lower, or similar to what you would be seeing for the handsets?\n",
            "[00:44:41,100 --> 00:44:49,140]  I think that ratio is slightly better than I think we did on our voice side.\n",
            "[00:44:49,140 --> 00:45:00,860]  Finally then, if you do expect that data revenue will continue to grow at that kind of pace,\n",
            "[00:45:00,860 --> 00:45:05,860]  do you think that there is any risk that you would have to increase your CapEx budget\n",
            "[00:45:05,860 --> 00:45:11,860]  in order to meet some of the demands of, obviously, data taking up much more capacity?\n",
            "[00:45:11,860 --> 00:45:13,860]  Not significantly.\n",
            "[00:45:13,860 --> 00:45:29,820]  As I have just mentioned, we are looking at our overall core network and going all IP.\n",
            "[00:45:29,820 --> 00:45:51,840]  I don't see ‚Äì I think all these programs are meant for us to minimize our OPEX.\n",
            "[00:45:51,840 --> 00:45:55,280]  Okay. Thank you.\n",
            "[00:45:55,280 --> 00:45:57,280]  Thank you once again, ladies and gentlemen.\n",

            "[00:46:15,260 --> 00:46:26,250]  the Chief Technical Officer is going to be James Chen, who is head of HPG.\n",
            "[00:46:26,250 --> 00:46:47,180]  And we do expect that James' work contributions are restructuring on that.\n",
            "[00:46:47,180 --> 00:46:51,480]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:46:51,480 --> 00:46:54,480]  Once again, ladies and gentlemen, that is the number 1 key for questions.\n",
            "[00:46:54,480 --> 00:47:03,270]  Excuse me, Rosie?\n",
            "[00:47:03,270 --> 00:47:04,270]  Yes?\n",
            "[00:47:04,270 --> 00:47:06,270]  There seems to be no further questions at this point in time.\n",
            "[00:47:06,270 --> 00:47:07,270]  Thank you.\n",

            "[00:02:45,890 --> 00:02:52,690]  there on the right-hand side for your reference is what we have for this year's forecast or budget,\n",
            "[00:02:52,690 --> 00:02:59,730]  I should say. So 2.83% is still our EPS target, although as you can tell, we have been doing\n",
            "[00:02:59,730 --> 00:03:09,250]  pretty well in reaching or above that target. All right. And then the next chart shows the trend on\n",
            "[00:03:09,250 --> 00:03:18,660]  some of the key for the revenue. So this is a five-quarter kind of review. So as you can see,\n",
            "[00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:28,990]  or if you remember, last March, we already have posted a positive on YG Uplift, and that certainly\n",
            "[00:03:28,990 --> 00:03:35,870]  helped the total revenue growth. And of course, at the same time, our ICT is very strong. So that\n",
            "[00:03:35,870 --> 00:03:42,670]  has been the case. So we have had a good year and more than that. And for the third quarter in\n",
            "[00:03:42,670 --> 00:03:48,430]  particular, because of the iPhone launch, the new iPhone, and usually that is the booster for our\n",
            "[00:03:48,430 --> 00:03:58,750]  mobile service and also for the 5G upgrade. So all in all, we have 7.0% YOY growth for the third\n",
            "[00:03:58,750 --> 00:04:06,020]  quarter alone. Okay. In terms of EBITDA, and this quarter, we actually reached a record high\n",
            "[00:04:06,020 --> 00:04:12,340]  since I joined Far East Homecome in the fourth quarter of 2018. So we are definitely on the\n",
            "[00:04:12,340 --> 00:04:20,580]  right track, and then it's going up. So we are happy to share that. And then this 7.9 YOY growth\n",
            "[00:04:20,580 --> 00:04:25,860]  mainly attributed to just the better service revenue margins across all services that we\n",
            "[00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:33,760]  offered. And finally, if you look at the EPS, right, so the third quarter net income, we reached\n",
            "[00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:47,260]  2.4 billion, and then EPS is at 0.74. It grew 15%, and it is highest in the industry. Okay.\n",
            "[00:04:47,260 --> 00:04:53,900]  And some financial metrics for your reference. So as you can tell that our net debt is very stable,\n",
            "[00:04:53,900 --> 00:05:00,780]  and we continue to pay down our borrowing. And then the net debt to EBITDA ratio is also\n",
            "[00:05:00,780 --> 00:05:07,580]  stable and has improved even. And then also we show a very strong cash flow. And of course,\n",
            "[00:05:07,580 --> 00:05:16,620]  part of that is our CAPEX. Cash CAPEX has decreased, because last year, it really 5G-related\n",
            "[00:05:16,620 --> 00:05:23,420]  investment kind of peak. So this year, we did scale back. So this reflects in the less cash-based\n",
            "[00:05:23,420 --> 00:05:34,000]  CAPEX spending. Okay. All right. So on the core business, so like 5G continues to be the driver\n",
            "[00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:41,760]  for our steady growth. So for the third quarter, and you can see this mobile service revenue alone,\n",
            "[00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:50,960]  it posted a 3.0% YOY growth. And the post-PAR pool, we continue to be the industry leader.\n",
            "[00:05:51,680 --> 00:06:01,040]  And also, the monthly fee for 5G renewal maintains up more than 20% uplift. Okay. That is very\n",
            "[00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:08,400]  helpful. And then our post-pay penetration percent actually has already reached 30%,\n",
            "[00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:14,640]  which is our year-end target. Okay. And then the post-pay churn rate has continued to\n",
            "[00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:26,320]  hit record low, and then we come to 0.92%. And then for our new economy, this growth momentum\n",
            "[00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:32,080]  has continued. So even though this year, we still are kind of under the cloud of COVID-19,\n",
            "[00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:42,560]  but that didn't stop us from the new economy to grow really nicely. So you can see up to\n",
            "[00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:47,840]  three quarters. So for the first three quarters, the new economy revenue already accounted for\n",
            "[00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:57,870]  19% of the total revenue. And our goal for this year was to have 18.9% of the total revenue for\n",
            "[00:06:57,870 --> 00:07:04,430]  new economy. So for the first three quarters, we have already exceeded that, even though our\n",
            "[00:07:04,430 --> 00:07:13,390]  core business is also growing. So this is good. And then year over year, it is 22.5% growth. Okay.\n",
            "[00:07:13,390 --> 00:07:19,790]  And the main drivers on the enterprise side is the cloud service and also our homegrown solutions\n",
            "[00:07:20,670 --> 00:07:27,070]  for AIoT and big data and also digital transformation all contributed to the growth\n",
            "[00:07:27,070 --> 00:07:34,270]  on the enterprise side. And for consumer, in the consumer IoT devices and our e-commerce,\n",
            "[00:07:34,270 --> 00:07:42,190]  that's the Friday shopping, also have posted good year over year growth. And the media service\n",
            "[00:07:42,270 --> 00:07:49,390]  also posted 5%. Media service is where it usually is kind of flat. But then last year,\n",
            "[00:07:49,390 --> 00:07:56,910]  because of the pandemic, we actually see really a boost in terms of using the tech kind of services.\n",
            "[00:07:56,910 --> 00:08:07,570]  So this is a big base, but they managed to have 5% of the worldwide growth. All right.\n",
            "[00:08:07,570 --> 00:08:17,010]  So just a little bit more on the ICT demand. So if we compare in the first three quarters,\n",
            "[00:08:17,010 --> 00:08:24,690]  the total contract values that we have signed compared to what we did last year, it shows a\n",
            "[00:08:24,690 --> 00:08:32,290]  40% increase worldwide. And that's spread across several areas such as smart building, digital\n",
            "[00:08:32,290 --> 00:08:39,010]  transformation, smart CD and big data platform, and then also some smart learning areas. And these\n",
            "[00:08:39,010 --> 00:08:44,210]  are, you know, especially because of the pandemic, that brings some remote learning kind of needs\n",
            "[00:08:44,930 --> 00:08:53,250]  and then demand. Okay. So if we further break down, so in the year today, we look at enterprise\n",
            "[00:08:53,250 --> 00:09:01,010]  revenue growth areas. 5G telemedicine service continues to grow very well, and it's at 87%\n",
            "[00:09:01,010 --> 00:09:07,170]  worldwide. And also we just, the latest news, we just received a National Innovation Award\n",
            "[00:09:07,170 --> 00:09:15,490]  for our telemedicine service platform. And on the 5G private network part, we are also\n",
            "[00:09:15,490 --> 00:09:24,770]  showing a 21% growth in big data analytics. These are part of like quite a bit of the digital\n",
            "[00:09:24,770 --> 00:09:31,170]  transformation projects will require big data analytics related work or data platform related\n",
            "[00:09:31,170 --> 00:09:39,410]  work. So we also see a very nice growth year over year. Then the cloud service. So we have a\n",
            "[00:09:39,410 --> 00:09:45,490]  subsidiary, Nexlink, and its growth is very impressive. So this continues to be one of the\n",
            "[00:09:45,490 --> 00:09:54,860]  growth engines for our enterprise side of the new economy. Okay. So some other business highlights\n",
            "[00:09:54,860 --> 00:10:05,660]  to share with you. So for example, we are leading the telco industry and our peers in offering the\n",
            "[00:10:05,660 --> 00:10:13,980]  free voltage service and also increase the connection speed for 5G users that are not on\n",
            "[00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:20,300]  unlimited data plan. And all these changes are really to consider more for the customer's sake\n",
            "[00:10:20,380 --> 00:10:28,220]  and what would make more sense for them as a consumer. So these are very welcoming for the\n",
            "[00:10:28,220 --> 00:10:36,340]  users. And this will also help us to eventually sunset the 3G. So all this has a reason for it.\n",
            "[00:10:36,340 --> 00:10:43,300]  And that also makes our customers very happy. And I know our peers also followed. So that was a good\n",
            "[00:10:43,300 --> 00:10:51,300]  trend we are leading. And then our Friday video, we have continued to invest in the content,\n",
            "[00:10:51,860 --> 00:10:58,580]  content investment, and then creation, curation. And we're going to have our first movie that we\n",
            "[00:10:59,140 --> 00:11:09,300]  co-produced with Public Television Service Taiwan. That will be on the 1st of December, I think.\n",
            "[00:11:09,300 --> 00:11:16,370]  Yeah. In December, it will have its debut. Okay. And then for our mobile telco application,\n",
            "[00:11:17,010 --> 00:11:26,290]  that is our digital reach to more of the users. So right now, it already has 4 million downloads.\n",
            "[00:11:26,290 --> 00:11:34,910]  This is almost like four times more than what we started. So this was an app that we started with\n",
            "[00:11:35,630 --> 00:11:45,630]  this mobile app for just mobile service related like a billing and all that. But we expanded to\n",
            "[00:11:45,630 --> 00:11:55,230]  a mobile circle. So where we offer many digital services and then related information. So we have\n",
            "[00:11:55,870 --> 00:12:03,950]  come from like 600,000 to 4 million downloads. So that was just in less than two years.\n",
            "[00:12:03,950 --> 00:12:11,090]  So this is a very good growth. And then this is to develop the member economy.\n",
            "[00:12:12,610 --> 00:12:19,970]  All right. And we also completed our first accelerator. We kicked it off last year,\n",
            "[00:12:19,970 --> 00:12:28,540]  December. And then we started this application process. Then we announced the 20 startups that\n",
            "[00:12:28,540 --> 00:12:35,090]  we selected in March. So we worked with them for about like six months during that period.\n",
            "[00:12:35,090 --> 00:12:42,290]  And many of them that we took them, so on the enterprise side, we have various projects where\n",
            "[00:12:42,290 --> 00:12:49,570]  they can co-create with us or actually see real problems where their technology or solution can\n",
            "[00:12:49,570 --> 00:12:57,810]  apply. So we have had quite a few successful cases. And then that amount to about $100 million\n",
            "[00:12:58,370 --> 00:13:05,810]  worth of contract values for the startup. And then as we mentioned at the beginning,\n",
            "[00:13:05,810 --> 00:13:13,520]  so these are our candidates where we will look at some of them that we can have strategic value in\n",
            "[00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:21,440]  and to go deeper. And then we'll invest in some of them. And also we issued the second social bond\n",
            "[00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:26,880]  for $1.8 billion to finance our 5G for ESG-related development work.\n",
            "[00:13:30,770 --> 00:13:39,570]  Okay. And then we have some awards and then some recognition. So on the top,\n",
            "[00:13:39,570 --> 00:13:49,940]  it's like ESG-related. Like we got ISO 20400 and for sustainable procurement guidance.\n",
            "[00:13:50,660 --> 00:14:00,540]  And then this is the first operator in Taiwan. And also our TV commercials that we produced in\n",
            "[00:14:00,540 --> 00:14:08,140]  earlier years that we actually got YouTube broadcast Taiwan for outstanding social\n",
            "[00:14:08,140 --> 00:14:14,860]  contribution award. And these two in particular were about during the pandemic, how some of the\n",
            "[00:14:14,940 --> 00:14:22,460]  chemicals, the soldiers that they have to do all those breads and then just to keep\n",
            "[00:14:24,460 --> 00:14:30,220]  people safe. But then at the same time, they have to be apart from their family or loved ones\n",
            "[00:14:30,220 --> 00:14:35,100]  because of the germs and all that people are afraid of. But then that is when the communication\n",
            "[00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:39,900]  service, of course, far eastern communication service would help them still connect.\n",
            "[00:14:39,900 --> 00:14:46,220]  So we had a couple of them. One is from the nurses. Those are working day and night during\n",
            "[00:14:46,220 --> 00:14:51,740]  that time at a hospital. And so both of these commercials got a lot of good rewards,\n",
            "[00:14:52,300 --> 00:14:59,180]  a lot of good feedback and also got this award from YouTube. So as we were told,\n",
            "[00:14:59,180 --> 00:15:04,460]  this is actually the first time they were giving out this award. Last year, there was no one\n",
            "[00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:10,640]  after this. So we are the first one to receive this award. So we appreciate that.\n",
            "[00:15:11,540 --> 00:15:17,220]  And then we were also named most outstanding company in Taiwan in the telecom sector this\n",
            "[00:15:17,220 --> 00:15:24,660]  year by Asia Money. And then so and we have a few other awards that recognize our transformation\n",
            "[00:15:25,460 --> 00:15:34,370]  leadership and also for IDC 2022, they have some future enterprise awards and then\n",
            "[00:15:35,330 --> 00:15:41,330]  and then we have a best in future of operations and myself get recognized there as well.\n",
            "[00:15:42,210 --> 00:15:48,610]  And then we have our project management benchmarking award. We also received that\n",
            "[00:15:48,610 --> 00:15:55,330]  for our ICP project management. And last but not least, as you may already been aware,\n",
            "[00:15:56,050 --> 00:16:03,570]  our service, customer service has always been recognized in many years in the role already.\n",
            "[00:16:03,650 --> 00:16:12,210]  And this time, it is another 15 awards that we received from CSEA Association. So this is\n",
            "[00:16:12,210 --> 00:16:20,290]  just something we continue to do and to do better every year. All right. And so finally,\n",
            "[00:16:20,290 --> 00:16:24,690]  and you probably have seen this similar slide last time I said, well, but then, you know,\n",
            "[00:16:25,890 --> 00:16:29,730]  this is what we need to do. We just don't change it every time we have an IR call. So\n",
            "[00:16:30,370 --> 00:16:36,930]  I just modified it a little bit to be even more targeted. So we will continue to sustain this\n",
            "[00:16:36,930 --> 00:16:46,050]  momentum for the telecom core business, especially with the 5G penetration. As you heard that we\n",
            "[00:16:46,050 --> 00:16:52,690]  already reached our annual target for 30%. So we'll continue to grow that. And then our current\n",
            "[00:16:53,410 --> 00:17:00,770]  EMS, that's the energy management system, which has got a lot of success this year in the ICT\n",
            "[00:17:00,770 --> 00:17:09,410]  project. And then we are investing in it and evolving it to account for more of the demand\n",
            "[00:17:09,410 --> 00:17:16,370]  in the green ICT ESG solutions area. So this is something we see the demand from the industry,\n",
            "[00:17:16,370 --> 00:17:25,730]  from the enterprise, solid EMS platform. And this is where we will do some more investments\n",
            "[00:17:25,730 --> 00:17:33,550]  so that we have ‚Äì so we will expand our solution set for the ICT clients. And then\n",
            "[00:17:35,310 --> 00:17:44,850]  in recent months, or you may remember, one of the major focus I have said that is something we will\n",
            "[00:17:44,850 --> 00:17:51,490]  do differently with enterprise is we have started this so-called consulting service.\n",
            "[00:17:51,490 --> 00:17:57,490]  So what we have found that is especially with new economy or digital transformation,\n",
            "[00:17:58,460 --> 00:18:05,740]  the client relationship is no longer an account kind of relationship. We really need a technical\n",
            "[00:18:05,740 --> 00:18:14,780]  expertise to get the trust, the confidence from the customers. So how we can engage through\n",
            "[00:18:14,780 --> 00:18:24,560]  the IT personnel and then train consultants to engage with IT from the client. So then\n",
            "[00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:29,520]  it's not project-based that we do the business with, but then we will become their strategic\n",
            "[00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:37,200]  partners and then help them build their roadmap for digital transformation.\n",
            "[00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:44,000]  And because usually that would include from like an infrastructure migration to the cloud. And then\n",
            "[00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:50,910]  so how do you do that? And then Far East Zone being a big IT company ourselves, a lot of this\n",
            "[00:18:50,910 --> 00:18:58,820]  we have done it, we have done it. So when we use our own expertise and experience plus the\n",
            "[00:18:58,820 --> 00:19:06,740]  technology we use and then to try to help our clients, it is a lot more convincing. And then\n",
            "[00:19:06,740 --> 00:19:13,700]  we demonstrate our results as well. So we will continue to do that. And then we do see that it\n",
            "[00:19:13,700 --> 00:19:20,240]  has been proven very successful, especially in terms of our engagement with some public sector\n",
            "[00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:26,720]  with universities and big companies like that. And then we will continue to grow our mobile circle\n",
            "[00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:35,040]  and then digital services and then finding the right partners to offer the kind of services\n",
            "[00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:42,720]  that will benefit our users and then build the kind of membership economy. Also, we are expanding\n",
            "[00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:50,880]  in the digital services like we, as you may have heard, we have joined ventures with China Trust\n",
            "[00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:59,440]  and we applied for this new insurance or the online insurance license. So, so far it is under\n",
            "[00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:04,800]  review, but we are very confident it will get approved. So that will be a new kind of FinTech\n",
            "[00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:11,200]  engagement that we will start. And then on top of that, in the video content business that we\n",
            "[00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:21,150]  have, we will continue to invest and we also have Alliance and join venture. And of course,\n",
            "[00:20:21,150 --> 00:20:33,630]  the merger, this is as the more folks are paying interest or attention to this matter. And then\n",
            "[00:20:33,630 --> 00:20:40,750]  this is getting some momentum to move again. So we are actually asked to present to the NCC\n",
            "[00:20:40,750 --> 00:20:50,590]  commissioner on 23rd. So I believe that is an indication that, you know, this whole thing is\n",
            "[00:20:50,590 --> 00:20:59,070]  moving again. So it depends on what will be discussed or what the commissioner may have for us.\n",
            "[00:20:59,070 --> 00:21:09,550]  And then I suppose this is, this should be close to the end in terms of when NCC will be able to\n",
            "[00:21:09,550 --> 00:21:16,270]  grant their approvals or not. So, and then after that, there will be the FTC. So, but at least I\n",
            "[00:21:16,270 --> 00:21:22,830]  think the good news is we are not in the kind of suspension kind of mode, but then it is actually\n",
            "[00:21:22,830 --> 00:21:31,070]  moving. So we are optimistic about it. And as we have been doing very well this year so far,\n",
            "[00:21:31,070 --> 00:21:37,120]  and then we will just finish the year strong. Okay. With that, I conclude my presentation for you all.\n",

            "[00:22:23,660 --> 00:22:31,660]  I have two questions, please. The first one is on the 5G private network. So, I wonder if you\n",
            "[00:22:31,660 --> 00:22:37,420]  could give some more details here. The 21%, I assume that's revenues or not sure if that's\n",
            "[00:22:37,420 --> 00:22:43,740]  contracts or bookings. And with the 5G private network, is that exclusive to the\n",
            "[00:22:44,540 --> 00:22:50,460]  corporate or the business that's requested that? Now, are you offering any network quality\n",
            "[00:22:50,460 --> 00:22:57,500]  guarantees within that or any additional services which aren't available in the broader 5G network?\n",
            "[00:22:57,500 --> 00:23:04,140]  So, some more detail there would be very much appreciated. And the second one is more of just\n",
            "[00:23:04,220 --> 00:23:10,860]  a reminder for me, please. Could you remind me about the 5G subsidies from the government? Is\n",
            "[00:23:10,860 --> 00:23:17,580]  that a regular amount each quarter? And when will that end? That would be great. Thank you.\n",
            "[00:23:27,620 --> 00:23:35,920]  Okay. Thank you, Neil. All right. So, for the 5G private network. So, last year,\n",
            "[00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:43,520]  we are, well, we started this kind of like in 2020. And it did take some time for the business\n",
            "[00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:51,440]  to accept to it. So, we are now seeing the momentum. So, I think this year, we probably have\n",
            "[00:23:51,440 --> 00:24:01,780]  20-something engagements or some contracts sealed with that. In terms of the type of,\n",
            "[00:24:01,780 --> 00:24:10,180]  so, we have different models in YBCD. But then these usually, they would have their dedicated\n",
            "[00:24:10,180 --> 00:24:18,820]  RAN. And they may ask for the MEC, the Mobile Edge Computing. And so, in terms of the kind\n",
            "[00:24:18,820 --> 00:24:25,460]  of quality of service or slicing that you were looking for, that is not in one of these.\n",
            "[00:24:25,460 --> 00:24:34,100]  Then in one of the public sector engagement, it's about using our macro network. So, not,\n",
            "[00:24:34,100 --> 00:24:39,380]  because this is like a full coverage, right, island-wide or nationwide. And then there,\n",
            "[00:24:39,380 --> 00:24:47,140]  we will be using the slicing to guarantee some service. So, but then that is still in,\n",
            "[00:24:47,140 --> 00:24:52,980]  we have done the POC. And then, but then for these other private network engagement,\n",
            "[00:24:52,980 --> 00:24:58,580]  we haven't used that one. So, they are dedicated to themselves. So, this quality of service kind\n",
            "[00:24:58,580 --> 00:25:10,900]  of, or slicing kind of arrangement wasn't needed. Okay. And in terms of the subsidy, so, the way\n",
            "[00:25:10,900 --> 00:25:19,060]  that we do this, because it's a subsidy for the equipment, right, related to hardware. So,\n",
            "[00:25:19,060 --> 00:25:26,820]  and then those equipment has a year for like up to seven years kind of amortization,\n",
            "[00:25:26,820 --> 00:25:32,020]  depreciation. So, that's how we would divide it. So, every month, actually, not even quarter,\n",
            "[00:25:32,020 --> 00:25:43,420]  every month we'll depreciate accordingly, evenly. Okay. So, I, so it's all together like about\n",
            "[00:25:43,420 --> 00:25:51,540]  seven years. And then we get, we started like last year for 2021. This is how we would do it.\n",
            "[00:25:53,180 --> 00:25:58,800]  Okay. Thank you. So, is the amount increasing or is it fairly regular?\n",
            "[00:26:01,380 --> 00:26:08,100]  It should be regular, pretty regular because what we have applied for, that's a lump sum. And then,\n",
            "[00:26:08,100 --> 00:26:13,700]  so then you divide it by however many months. Yeah. So, it's even, pretty even, I would say.\n",
            "[00:26:15,100 --> 00:26:22,540]  Got it. Thank you. And just, sorry, I'm a network slicing side. So,\n",
            "[00:26:23,340 --> 00:26:29,100]  that's to come, is it? Or you've launched that already and it just seems that network slicing\n",
            "[00:26:29,100 --> 00:26:33,740]  is still quite early days with a lot of other operators. So, just interested in the timing on\n",
            "[00:26:33,740 --> 00:26:39,980]  that one. Well, so, actually, we were the first one with Ericsson that we did the first slicing\n",
            "[00:26:41,020 --> 00:26:48,780]  application worldwide. And then in terms of the local implementation, we have done that with\n",
            "[00:26:48,780 --> 00:26:56,460]  police station in Kaohsiung. So, it's really beyond a POC. So, that licensing is turned on.\n",
            "[00:26:56,460 --> 00:27:02,220]  And then, but then that is for the Kaohsiung area, a special area. And so, what I was saying,\n",
            "[00:27:02,220 --> 00:27:09,660]  this is actually kind of like what we did in AT&T for FirstNet in the U.S. So, that is to give the\n",
            "[00:27:09,660 --> 00:27:17,310]  first respondents, they're like a guaranteed bandwidth on the mobile network. So, that's\n",
            "[00:27:17,310 --> 00:27:23,570]  kind of the same concept. And I asked my team to implement with this slicing. So, we approved that\n",
            "[00:27:23,570 --> 00:27:36,560]  with the police station in Kaohsiung. So, for application that we haven't really engaged for\n",
            "[00:27:36,560 --> 00:27:41,040]  the, because that you have to go through the central and all the local police and all that.\n",
            "[00:27:41,040 --> 00:27:46,960]  But this is definitely a proven technology as far as Far Eastern is concerned, because we have\n",
            "[00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:55,280]  done it. And then even with Ericsson, we have done that earlier too. So, but then if you ask for\n",
            "[00:27:55,280 --> 00:27:59,280]  other telcos, this is probably still early for them. But we have done it.\n",
            "[00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:02,720]  Got it. That's very helpful. Thank you.\n",
            "[00:28:03,540 --> 00:28:04,040]  Okay.\n",
            "[00:28:07,700 --> 00:28:11,460]  Next question is from Sarah Wan of UBS. Go ahead, please.\n",
            "[00:28:12,860 --> 00:28:20,060]  Thank you and congratulations on a solid result. So, I have two questions. Yeah. First is maybe on\n",
            "[00:28:20,140 --> 00:28:28,220]  CapEx. So, maybe say for next year or even like next three years, do you see any change in the\n",
            "[00:28:28,220 --> 00:28:35,900]  CapEx structure? Meaning it seems like large-scale 5G spending is already peaked. So, going forward,\n",
            "[00:28:35,900 --> 00:28:42,300]  do we have any plan to develop in-house capabilities, for example, SaaS or cloud or\n",
            "[00:28:42,860 --> 00:28:51,740]  anything besides 5G? And then my second question is, what are the key topics to cover for the\n",
            "[00:28:51,740 --> 00:28:58,540]  presentation to NCC on November 23rd? And do you see any key hurdle to overcome in order to get\n",
            "[00:28:58,540 --> 00:29:09,540]  the approval from NCC? Thank you. Okay. In terms of a CapEx structure, I would still say network\n",
            "[00:29:09,540 --> 00:29:18,180]  CapEx usually is the biggest item, right? But then overall, last year is our CapEx peaked,\n",
            "[00:29:18,180 --> 00:29:24,900]  right, because of the 5G construction. Now, assuming this merger will get approved,\n",
            "[00:29:25,620 --> 00:29:33,220]  as we have presented before, we will have a lot of synergy because of the merger. So,\n",
            "[00:29:33,220 --> 00:29:41,140]  that includes CapEx and OpEx savings. So, that itself wouldn't increase the CapEx. But then,\n",
            "[00:29:41,140 --> 00:29:51,860]  on the other hand, right, so we have the 2600 spectrum. So, if we are ready, if we see the need\n",
            "[00:29:51,860 --> 00:30:00,580]  to increase our capacity on 5G to use the 2600 band, then we may invest, you know, some in that\n",
            "[00:30:00,580 --> 00:30:09,940]  area. Other than that, for the 5G, 3.5G spectrum, you know, investment, I think we are pretty happy\n",
            "[00:30:09,940 --> 00:30:18,610]  about where we are. And then, of course, later on, we will have the core network migration,\n",
            "[00:30:18,610 --> 00:30:25,090]  and then we will have some transportation, transport network migration as well. So,\n",
            "[00:30:25,090 --> 00:30:33,250]  but then those kind of CapEx is still, I wouldn't say it's significant, especially compared to what\n",
            "[00:30:33,250 --> 00:30:39,090]  we would have to spend for 5G. So, those are all manageable. And then, so, I think the CapEx is,\n",
            "[00:30:40,850 --> 00:30:48,140]  the structure wouldn't change much, but then definitely lower. Okay. On the second question\n",
            "[00:30:48,140 --> 00:30:53,660]  for NCC, well, I was asking the same question because for, well, we can say we have said it\n",
            "[00:30:53,660 --> 00:30:59,260]  many times now through different presentations, through different, you know, through different\n",
            "[00:30:59,260 --> 00:31:07,180]  forums. But I think one of the, or the most sticking point is, if you haven't heard, it's about the\n",
            "[00:31:07,180 --> 00:31:16,700]  spectrum over the one-third limit. And that, in particular, is for our peers, in their case,\n",
            "[00:31:16,700 --> 00:31:28,780]  because the one-third of the ceiling is especially very important for the sub-1G spectrum,\n",
            "[00:31:28,780 --> 00:31:36,300]  and that's where they have exceeded by a lot, 20%. And then, you know, depending on how you\n",
            "[00:31:36,300 --> 00:31:44,780]  interpret the regulation, right, for us, for China, for Tsinghua, and for Far East zone,\n",
            "[00:31:45,660 --> 00:31:49,660]  if we really have to debate, you know, the change on the regulation and all that,\n",
            "[00:31:50,540 --> 00:31:57,180]  then, you know, they said we exceeded too. But then, even if that's the case, what we have exceeded\n",
            "[00:31:57,180 --> 00:32:05,100]  is really compared to what telemobile has exceeded. That is like a non-issue. So, we have already\n",
            "[00:32:05,100 --> 00:32:11,620]  stated if that has to be the case, and we can return as needed. So, that's no issue for us.\n",
            "[00:32:12,260 --> 00:32:20,820]  But then, I think the other, our peer has different opinion. They definitely are exceeding,\n",
            "[00:32:20,820 --> 00:32:26,420]  no matter how you interpret the regulation. But the question is, would they be willing\n",
            "[00:32:26,420 --> 00:32:34,660]  to return it, or what would be the conditions in return for the NCC to grant them the approval?\n",
            "[00:32:34,740 --> 00:32:41,300]  So, I think that is indeed a sticking point. And then, we are just like, okay, we are impacted\n",
            "[00:32:42,180 --> 00:32:50,580]  as well, but then, certainly, the major impact would be for the other party. And then, what we\n",
            "[00:32:50,580 --> 00:32:58,020]  two have in common is we all, we both have to deal with the employees, right? And that is just\n",
            "[00:32:58,100 --> 00:33:04,820]  for any merger, you have to consider the company that is going to be acquired, and what are the\n",
            "[00:33:04,820 --> 00:33:12,980]  employees going to do? So, the employee arrangement plan is what would be an issue. But we have had\n",
            "[00:33:13,620 --> 00:33:24,020]  some reasonable conversations, open communications with the labor union of APT. So, so far,\n",
            "[00:33:24,020 --> 00:33:29,700]  I think that is progressing well, or reasonably well. So, we don't think that should be an issue.\n",
            "[00:33:29,700 --> 00:33:36,180]  And then, anyway, that should not be the focus of the NCC anyway. So, I think they were still\n",
            "[00:33:36,180 --> 00:33:42,660]  going to ask us, so, how are you doing with your employee arrangement plan? And then, I would,\n",
            "[00:33:43,940 --> 00:33:50,740]  I would guess they will have to talk about this possible resolution or different options\n",
            "[00:33:50,740 --> 00:33:58,580]  to resolve this inspection ceiling issue. And then, we'll see what they offer, and then,\n",

            "[00:19:26,210 --> 00:19:28,210]  This is not just about telecom.\n",
            "[00:19:28,210 --> 00:19:31,210]  This is the service industry, period.\n",
            "[00:19:31,210 --> 00:19:32,210]  We were the best.\n",

            "[00:19:35,210 --> 00:19:36,210]  It is a golden award.\n",
            "[00:19:36,210 --> 00:19:39,210]  This award actually started 11 years ago.\n",
            "[00:19:39,210 --> 00:19:42,210]  We are the only one that has been receiving the award\n",

            "[00:19:55,210 --> 00:19:58,210]  because we see the demand on the digital transformation.\n",
            "[00:19:58,210 --> 00:20:07,210]  We have joined forces with our IT department to join forces\n",

            "[00:20:28,210 --> 00:20:32,210]  Then we will promote it more so there are more companies\n",

            "[00:20:56,500 --> 00:20:59,500]  As I mentioned earlier, this will definitely boost\n",

            "[00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:07,500]  Also, our mobile circle, which is a digital platform,\n",

            "[00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:38,500]  for FET, APT, which is actually moving along.\n",
            "[00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:42,500]  So far, both Fair Trade Committee and also NCC\n",
            "[00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:45,500]  have held a forum separately.\n",
            "[00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:48,500]  FTC held it in May, back in May,\n",
            "[00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:52,500]  and NCC just had it last week.\n",
            "[00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:56,500]  So this is with scholars and some officials\n",
            "[00:21:56,500 --> 00:21:58,500]  and with the telcos.\n",
            "[00:21:58,500 --> 00:22:02,500]  So we had a closed-door discussion and presentation.\n",
            "[00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:04,500]  So both have done that.\n",
            "[00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:08,530]  And for NCC, they will have a hearing\n",
            "[00:22:08,530 --> 00:22:10,530]  that will be in September.\n",
            "[00:22:10,530 --> 00:22:13,530]  But as far as we can tell, things are moving along.\n",

            "[00:22:16,530 --> 00:22:20,530]  they're all kind of in support of this merger\n",
            "[00:22:20,530 --> 00:22:22,530]  for both cases, actually.\n",
            "[00:22:22,530 --> 00:22:26,190]  All right.\n",
            "[00:22:26,190 --> 00:22:29,190]  Okay, so with that, I will conclude my presentation\n",
            "[00:22:29,190 --> 00:22:31,190]  for you all, and then we will welcome...\n",

            "[00:22:34,270 --> 00:22:36,270]  And ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin\n",
            "[00:22:36,270 --> 00:22:38,270]  our question-and-answer session.\n",
            "[00:22:38,270 --> 00:22:41,270]  If you have a question for any of today's speakers,\n",

            "[00:22:44,270 --> 00:22:46,270]  and you will enter the queue.\n",
            "[00:22:46,270 --> 00:22:49,270]  After you are announced, please ask your question.\n",
            "[00:22:49,270 --> 00:22:51,270]  If you find that your question has been answered\n",
            "[00:22:51,270 --> 00:22:53,270]  before it is your turn to speak,\n",
            "[00:22:53,270 --> 00:22:56,270]  please press 02 to cancel the question.\n",
            "[00:22:56,270 --> 00:22:59,270]  Now please press 01 to ask the question.\n",
            "[00:22:59,270 --> 00:23:03,440]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:06,440]  Our first question is coming from Neil Anderson, HSBC.\n",
            "[00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:07,440]  Go ahead, please.\n",
            "[00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:09,940]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:23:09,940 --> 00:23:10,940]  Good afternoon.\n",
            "[00:23:10,940 --> 00:23:12,980]  I have three questions, please.\n",
            "[00:23:12,980 --> 00:23:15,980]  The first one is on mobile postpaid ARPU.\n",
            "[00:23:15,980 --> 00:23:17,980]  So $719 in the quarter,\n",
            "[00:23:17,980 --> 00:23:21,980]  and that's quite a bit higher than the previous five quarters.\n",
            "[00:23:21,980 --> 00:23:25,010]  So were there any one-offs in the quarter\n",
            "[00:23:25,010 --> 00:23:27,010]  that drove that rise,\n",
            "[00:23:27,010 --> 00:23:30,010]  and do you expect that to continue at these levels?\n",
            "[00:23:30,010 --> 00:23:34,740]  The second question relates to the APT cooperation.\n",
            "[00:23:34,740 --> 00:23:36,740]  So you mentioned the EBITDA,\n",
            "[00:23:36,740 --> 00:23:40,740]  that record high is due in part to APT cooperation.\n",
            "[00:23:40,740 --> 00:23:42,740]  Again, was there anything that changed,\n",
            "[00:23:42,740 --> 00:23:43,740]  particularly in the quarter?\n",
            "[00:23:43,740 --> 00:23:46,740]  Or is it just more volume that's driving that EBITDA growth?\n",
            "[00:23:46,740 --> 00:23:51,900]  And then the final query relates to 5G,\n",
            "[00:23:51,900 --> 00:23:57,000]  and I know you started the network slicing with the police.\n",
            "[00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:01,190]  5G has obviously been rolled out for a while,\n",
            "[00:24:01,190 --> 00:24:05,190]  and this is one of the first types of sort of live trial,\n",
            "[00:24:05,190 --> 00:24:08,190]  if you like, or live service that we're seeing.\n",
            "[00:24:08,190 --> 00:24:11,290]  Do you expect that pace to pick up now?\n",
            "[00:24:11,290 --> 00:24:15,290]  Now you've got a proof of concept that's live and working,\n",
            "[00:24:15,290 --> 00:24:18,290]  or is it still pretty slow in persuading government\n",
            "[00:24:18,290 --> 00:24:21,290]  and enterprise customers of the benefits of 5G?\n",
            "[00:24:21,290 --> 00:24:22,290]  Thanks very much.\n",
            "[00:24:22,290 --> 00:24:24,830]  Okay.\n",
            "[00:24:24,830 --> 00:24:25,830]  All right.\n",
            "[00:24:25,830 --> 00:24:27,830]  Thank you, Neil, for your three questions.\n",
            "[00:24:27,830 --> 00:24:29,830]  So I'll answer them one by one.\n",
            "[00:24:29,830 --> 00:24:32,830]  So the first one is for mobile, right?\n",
            "[00:24:32,830 --> 00:24:35,830]  So this is contributed by,\n",
            "[00:24:35,830 --> 00:24:39,830]  as we convert more 5G customers, right?\n",
            "[00:24:39,830 --> 00:24:43,830]  So you look at how we calculate our pool.\n",
            "[00:24:43,830 --> 00:24:49,830]  So the numerator is becoming bigger, right,\n",
            "[00:24:49,830 --> 00:24:51,830]  and the denominator is the same\n",
            "[00:24:51,830 --> 00:24:53,830]  in terms of the number of subscribers.\n",
            "[00:24:53,830 --> 00:24:55,830]  So this number will continue to grow,\n",
            "[00:24:55,830 --> 00:24:57,830]  and that's what I would expect.\n",
            "[00:24:57,830 --> 00:25:00,830]  Okay, that's to your first question.\n",
            "[00:25:00,830 --> 00:25:04,830]  And then the second question is on the APD cooperation.\n",
            "[00:25:04,830 --> 00:25:09,830]  So this is an amortized expense,\n",
            "[00:25:09,830 --> 00:25:12,830]  or the cost that they pay us, right,\n",
            "[00:25:12,830 --> 00:25:15,830]  for both the spectrum,\n",
            "[00:25:15,830 --> 00:25:18,830]  and then also other depreciation,\n",
            "[00:25:18,830 --> 00:25:21,830]  CAPEX depreciation, OPEX sharing, and all that,\n",
            "[00:25:21,830 --> 00:25:23,830]  and then we amortize it accordingly.\n",
            "[00:25:23,830 --> 00:25:26,830]  So this will just add up.\n",
            "[00:25:26,830 --> 00:25:29,830]  And then this is also steady.\n",
            "[00:25:29,830 --> 00:25:33,830]  And then also another is we have,\n",
            "[00:25:33,830 --> 00:25:36,830]  there's still MDNO service that we granted them,\n",
            "[00:25:36,830 --> 00:25:40,830]  and then that will continue to generate revenue as well.\n",
            "[00:25:40,830 --> 00:25:47,080]  So those are what I was referring to as the APD cooperation.\n",
            "[00:25:47,080 --> 00:25:51,080]  And then for the third one, 5G slicing, you're right.\n",
            "[00:25:51,080 --> 00:25:55,080]  So that one is actually, although it's a police department,\n",
            "[00:25:55,080 --> 00:26:00,080]  it is still to us, it's not consumer type of application yet.\n",
            "[00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:06,560]  I still would see, for example, like the telemedicine, right?\n",
            "[00:26:06,560 --> 00:26:12,560]  Although right now the Ministry of Health Care and Welfare,\n",
            "[00:26:12,560 --> 00:26:17,560]  their focus is how we make the rural areas,\n",
            "[00:26:17,560 --> 00:26:22,560]  those are like less advantaged areas,\n",
            "[00:26:22,560 --> 00:26:27,560]  they can get as good medical services as the urban areas.\n",
            "[00:26:27,560 --> 00:26:29,560]  So the focus has been there,\n",
            "[00:26:29,560 --> 00:26:34,560]  and then it is not to the individual consumers anywhere yet.\n",
            "[00:26:34,560 --> 00:26:39,560]  However, they have since relaxed on the scenario\n",
            "[00:26:39,560 --> 00:26:42,560]  where telemedicine can be applied\n",
            "[00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:45,560]  and also be reimbursed for the insurance,\n",
            "[00:26:45,560 --> 00:26:49,560]  which is important for the adoption of this service.\n",
            "[00:26:49,560 --> 00:26:53,560]  So we are seeing more scenarios that will be applied,\n",
            "[00:26:53,560 --> 00:26:55,560]  and then that's why during pandemic,\n",
            "[00:26:55,560 --> 00:26:58,560]  even though we did that for free during that time\n",
            "[00:26:58,560 --> 00:27:02,560]  to make this online app available,\n",
            "[00:27:02,560 --> 00:27:06,560]  and then people can download it on their mobile,\n",
            "[00:27:06,560 --> 00:27:09,560]  but that is kind of like a prelude\n",
            "[00:27:09,560 --> 00:27:14,560]  to such consumer-driven, consumer-facing application.\n",
            "[00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:17,560]  And that, what I would consider,\n",
            "[00:27:17,560 --> 00:27:19,560]  when that becomes more prevalent\n",
            "[00:27:19,560 --> 00:27:27,560]  or as the regulation of this health policy is more relaxed,\n",
            "[00:27:27,560 --> 00:27:29,560]  there will be more adoption.\n",
            "[00:27:29,560 --> 00:27:32,560]  And that's when people will definitely see the difference\n",
            "[00:27:32,560 --> 00:27:37,560]  between having a 4G service versus a 5G service,\n",
            "[00:27:37,560 --> 00:27:40,560]  because you do want your doctors to see you\n",
            "[00:27:40,560 --> 00:27:45,560]  and your symptoms and then your charts and all that\n",
            "[00:27:45,560 --> 00:27:48,560]  with no lag and with good resolution.\n",
            "[00:27:48,560 --> 00:27:52,560]  So there, the 5G versus 4G will make a difference,\n",
            "[00:27:52,560 --> 00:27:55,560]  and people will see that and people will take it seriously.\n",
            "[00:27:55,560 --> 00:27:57,560]  That, if you ask me,\n",
            "[00:27:57,560 --> 00:27:59,560]  what will be a killer application,\n",
            "[00:27:59,560 --> 00:28:02,560]  and I'll say it is not about independence.\n",
            "[00:28:02,560 --> 00:28:03,560]  It is about your health,\n",
            "[00:28:03,560 --> 00:28:06,560]  and then sometimes it could be life-threatening.\n",
            "[00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:08,560]  So that will be something like that.\n",
            "[00:28:08,560 --> 00:28:15,560]  And then the other areas that I would say for 5G,\n",
            "[00:28:15,560 --> 00:28:20,560]  we have heard enough about ARVR,\n",
            "[00:28:20,560 --> 00:28:25,550]  but that's all kind of, it's not critical demand.\n",
            "[00:28:25,550 --> 00:28:27,550]  Maybe there are some people kind of like that,\n",
            "[00:28:27,550 --> 00:28:30,550]  want that, but it's not something they need.\n",
            "[00:28:30,550 --> 00:28:33,550]  So that will take time to take off.\n",
            "[00:28:33,550 --> 00:28:37,550]  However, for AR and VR type of applications,\n",
            "[00:28:37,550 --> 00:28:42,550]  there's still a lot of applications we already have today,\n",
            "[00:28:42,550 --> 00:28:47,550]  like watch the videos, right, with the 3D and all that.\n",
            "[00:28:47,550 --> 00:28:50,550]  But we have the technology advancement\n",
            "[00:28:50,550 --> 00:28:54,550]  can already make them a more acceptable solution\n",
            "[00:28:54,550 --> 00:28:56,550]  and make it more prevalent.\n",
            "[00:28:56,550 --> 00:28:58,550]  We don't really need to have metaphors\n",
            "[00:28:58,550 --> 00:29:03,550]  all kind of painted out to see the benefits.\n",
            "[00:29:03,550 --> 00:29:10,550]  So that is where I see the 5G kind of application for users.\n",
            "[00:29:10,550 --> 00:29:15,380]  And then also another driver would be\n",
            "[00:29:15,380 --> 00:29:18,380]  kind of from the not-so-positive side,\n",
            "[00:29:18,380 --> 00:29:22,380]  that is as more people using more data,\n",
            "[00:29:22,380 --> 00:29:26,380]  which is the data usage we see from our statistics,\n",
            "[00:29:27,380 --> 00:29:30,380]  or from our data, just continues to grow.\n",
            "[00:29:30,380 --> 00:29:33,380]  Every month it's growing, it's growing.\n",
            "[00:29:33,380 --> 00:29:36,380]  So 4G is getting congested.\n",
            "[00:29:36,380 --> 00:29:38,380]  Eventually you can say, well, yeah, 4G is great\n",
            "[00:29:38,380 --> 00:29:40,380]  when nobody is traveling on it, right?\n",
            "[00:29:40,380 --> 00:29:44,380]  Like you have a great highway you built just a few years ago,\n",
            "[00:29:44,380 --> 00:29:48,380]  but then when you are, when there are not many cars on it,\n",
            "[00:29:48,380 --> 00:29:49,380]  it's great.\n",
            "[00:29:49,380 --> 00:29:51,380]  And then you say, why do I need another highway?\n",
            "[00:29:51,380 --> 00:29:53,380]  But when they're full of cars,\n",
            "[00:29:53,380 --> 00:29:57,380]  and people couldn't really move fast enough on this highway,\n",
            "[00:29:57,380 --> 00:30:00,380]  you would think about if there's another one that you can,\n",
            "[00:30:00,380 --> 00:30:02,380]  you know, the congestion could be relieved,\n",
            "[00:30:02,380 --> 00:30:04,380]  and then 5G would be that solution.\n",
            "[00:30:04,380 --> 00:30:08,380]  So I think it's from both of the new applications\n",
            "[00:30:08,380 --> 00:30:12,410]  and also from the fact people's users,\n",
            "[00:30:12,410 --> 00:30:15,410]  or just the consumers in general,\n",
            "[00:30:15,410 --> 00:30:18,410]  their demand for data is growing daily.\n",
            "[00:30:18,410 --> 00:30:21,410]  And then our 4G capacity is fixed.\n",
            "[00:30:21,410 --> 00:30:24,570]  So 5G is the solution to that.\n",
            "[00:30:24,570 --> 00:30:27,570]  So sooner or later they just have to, you know,\n",
            "[00:30:27,570 --> 00:30:31,570]  be moved to 5G so they can use both 4G and 5G.\n",
            "[00:30:31,570 --> 00:30:35,620]  So there's enough driver, as I can see,\n",
            "[00:30:35,620 --> 00:30:38,620]  that's why we see a steady conversion, right,\n",
            "[00:30:38,620 --> 00:30:41,620]  from the user base we have.\n",
            "[00:30:41,620 --> 00:30:43,660]  Okay, I hope that answers your question, Neil.\n",
            "[00:30:43,660 --> 00:30:44,660]  It did.\n",
            "[00:30:44,660 --> 00:30:47,100]  Thank you very much.\n",
            "[00:30:47,100 --> 00:30:50,100]  It's very interesting to get your thoughts on the 5G side\n",
            "[00:30:50,100 --> 00:30:52,100]  and particularly the health element.\n",
            "[00:30:53,100 --> 00:30:57,100]  If I could just follow up on the post-paid APU side.\n",
            "[00:30:57,100 --> 00:31:01,100]  So I understand that it's greater volume of 5G customers.\n",
            "[00:31:01,100 --> 00:31:07,100]  In other markets, as you sort of move towards 30% adoption,\n",
            "[00:31:07,100 --> 00:31:10,320]  the uplift has dropped,\n",
            "[00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:12,540]  which is kind of what you'd expect, I guess,\n",
            "[00:31:12,540 --> 00:31:16,540]  because the high-spending users, the high-value users move first.\n",
            "[00:31:16,540 --> 00:31:19,540]  But it sounds like that what you're seeing\n",
            "[00:31:19,540 --> 00:31:22,540]  is you're seeing a fairly consistent uplift.\n",
            "[00:31:22,540 --> 00:31:25,540]  As you say in the slide, it's above 20%,\n",
            "[00:31:25,540 --> 00:31:28,540]  and it's that volume that's driving the increase in APU.\n",
            "[00:31:28,540 --> 00:31:31,090]  Have I got that right?\n",
            "[00:31:31,090 --> 00:31:32,090]  Right.\n",
            "[00:31:32,090 --> 00:31:35,090]  Because, you know, it's kind of ironic, right?\n",
            "[00:31:35,090 --> 00:31:41,090]  So for those that were already at a high rate for the 4G plan,\n",
            "[00:31:41,090 --> 00:31:43,090]  those were the ones that we feel\n",
            "[00:31:43,090 --> 00:31:46,090]  they are the likely early adopters kind, right?\n",
            "[00:31:46,090 --> 00:31:49,090]  So we approach them first.\n",
            "[00:31:49,090 --> 00:31:50,090]  But then if you think about it,\n",
            "[00:31:50,090 --> 00:31:54,090]  because their rate already was higher,\n",
            "[00:31:54,090 --> 00:31:58,090]  so the delta from their current rate or their 4G rate\n",
            "[00:31:58,090 --> 00:32:01,090]  to the 5G rate, actually the delta, will be smaller.\n",
            "[00:32:01,090 --> 00:32:06,090]  But then if I were able to move a lower rate, you know,\n",
            "[00:32:06,090 --> 00:32:08,090]  customer in 4G to 5G,\n",
            "[00:32:08,090 --> 00:32:11,090]  the delta could be actually larger, bigger.\n",
            "[00:32:11,090 --> 00:32:14,180]  So that's why you get this mix, right?\n",
            "[00:32:14,180 --> 00:32:16,180]  And also because in 5G,\n",
            "[00:32:16,180 --> 00:32:21,180]  so when we move a 4G lower rate planned user to 5G,\n",
            "[00:32:21,180 --> 00:32:23,180]  of course we wouldn't,\n",
            "[00:32:23,180 --> 00:32:26,180]  they wouldn't want to move all the way to $13.99.\n",
            "[00:32:26,180 --> 00:32:30,180]  That's why we have $9.99, $7.99 kind of offer.\n",
            "[00:32:30,180 --> 00:32:32,180]  But then in terms of the delta,\n",
            "[00:32:32,180 --> 00:32:34,180]  they could be just as big, if not bigger,\n",
            "[00:32:34,180 --> 00:32:37,180]  than those high rate, you know, customers\n",
            "[00:32:37,180 --> 00:32:40,180]  that we moved at the earlier stage.\n",
            "[00:32:40,180 --> 00:32:43,280]  So I do expect this to be, you know,\n",
            "[00:32:43,280 --> 00:32:46,280]  pretty much about the same or, you know, still.\n",
            "[00:32:46,280 --> 00:32:47,280]  Yeah.\n",
            "[00:32:47,280 --> 00:32:50,490]  That's great.\n",
            "[00:32:50,490 --> 00:32:51,490]  Did I help?\n",
            "[00:32:51,490 --> 00:32:52,490]  Thank you very much.\n",
            "[00:32:52,490 --> 00:32:53,580]  Appreciate it.\n",
            "[00:32:53,580 --> 00:32:57,050]  Okay.\n",
            "[00:32:57,050 --> 00:32:59,050]  If you would like to ask a question,\n",
            "[00:32:59,050 --> 00:33:01,050]  please press 01 on your telephone keypad.\n",
            "[00:33:01,050 --> 00:33:02,660]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:33:02,660 --> 00:33:04,660]  Next we'll have Peter Millican of Deutsche Bank\n",
            "[00:33:04,660 --> 00:33:05,660]  for questions.\n",
            "[00:33:05,660 --> 00:33:07,140]  Go ahead, please.\n",
            "[00:33:07,140 --> 00:33:10,140]  Hi, good afternoon, and great results.\n",
            "[00:33:10,140 --> 00:33:14,230]  My question is really about the congestion that you mentioned.\n",
            "[00:33:14,230 --> 00:33:17,230]  I understand that it will be an issue for all operators,\n",
            "[00:33:17,230 --> 00:33:20,230]  and I'm wondering whether you think the industry\n",
            "[00:33:20,230 --> 00:33:25,230]  may consider lifting the pricing of the unlimited 4G plans\n",
            "[00:33:25,230 --> 00:33:28,230]  as part of the solution.\n",
            "[00:33:28,230 --> 00:33:31,520]  You know, I wish we could.\n",
            "[00:33:31,520 --> 00:33:35,740]  So, you know, I think sooner or later,\n",
            "[00:33:35,740 --> 00:33:40,740]  but then I have to say I think that our consumers\n",
            "[00:33:40,740 --> 00:33:46,740]  have been tempered, if not spoiled, very well.\n",
            "[00:33:46,740 --> 00:33:53,740]  So it's really hard to raise the plan on 4G, right?\n",
            "[00:33:53,740 --> 00:34:00,740]  But then I would say at least maybe our focus is more on 5G,\n",
            "[00:34:00,740 --> 00:34:05,740]  so we will put more of our marketing resources on the 5G,\n",
            "[00:34:05,740 --> 00:34:09,740]  so the promotions or campaigns or, you know, promotions,\n",
            "[00:34:09,740 --> 00:34:10,740]  I would say.\n",
            "[00:34:10,740 --> 00:34:14,740]  So promotions, sometimes we give some extra goodies\n",
            "[00:34:14,740 --> 00:34:15,740]  and then all that.\n",
            "[00:34:15,740 --> 00:34:18,740]  We'll put more on the 5G side, but then for the 4G,\n",
            "[00:34:18,740 --> 00:34:22,740]  we wouldn't entice them with more, you know, such goodies.\n",
            "[00:34:22,740 --> 00:34:25,740]  So that's where we will shift our resources a little bit.\n",
            "[00:34:25,740 --> 00:34:28,740]  But if you want to change the rate plan,\n",
            "[00:34:28,740 --> 00:34:31,740]  and you know we can have, you know,\n",
            "[00:34:31,740 --> 00:34:34,740]  we are independent operators, so everybody has different strategy.\n",
            "[00:34:34,740 --> 00:34:36,740]  We cannot all do that at the same time,\n",
            "[00:34:36,740 --> 00:34:38,740]  and the government will say, well, you guys are, you know,\n",
            "[00:34:38,740 --> 00:34:39,740]  what are you guys trying to do?\n",
            "[00:34:39,740 --> 00:34:41,740]  You're colluding, right?\n",
            "[00:34:41,740 --> 00:34:43,740]  So we cannot do that, and we won't do that.\n",
            "[00:34:43,740 --> 00:34:47,740]  But then the fact is, if I'm the one to raise the price first,\n",
            "[00:34:47,740 --> 00:34:51,740]  right away, my rival is waiting to get those customers from me,\n",
            "[00:34:51,740 --> 00:34:53,740]  unhappy customers.\n",
            "[00:34:53,740 --> 00:34:57,740]  So I think people are already used to it, you know,\n",
            "[00:34:57,740 --> 00:35:01,740]  and then our only chance was because 5G is a new technology,\n",
            "[00:35:01,740 --> 00:35:03,740]  it did bring you a lot more capacity,\n",
            "[00:35:03,740 --> 00:35:08,740]  so the rate increase, and also not to mention the billions\n",
            "[00:35:08,740 --> 00:35:14,740]  that we paid on the spectrum.\n",
            "[00:35:14,740 --> 00:35:17,740]  So it's well justified, and people can understand.\n",
            "[00:35:17,740 --> 00:35:20,740]  They may not like it, but they understand, right?\n",
            "[00:35:20,740 --> 00:35:25,740]  That's only reasonable to raise the rate plan for 5G is higher\n",
            "[00:35:25,740 --> 00:35:27,740]  than what they have now in 4G.\n",
            "[00:35:27,740 --> 00:35:30,740]  Otherwise, who can survive this telecom business?\n",
            "[00:35:30,740 --> 00:35:32,740]  Who wants to do this telecom business, right?\n",
            "[00:35:32,740 --> 00:35:34,740]  That just wouldn't make any sense.\n",
            "[00:35:34,740 --> 00:35:37,740]  It was getting frustrating for many of us for a long time,\n",
            "[00:35:37,740 --> 00:35:39,740]  but it's good to see you come out the other side.\n",
            "[00:35:39,740 --> 00:35:44,220]  And I told them, whoever started this unlimited data, you know,\n",
            "[00:35:44,220 --> 00:35:47,220]  program is like a, gosh, you know,\n",
            "[00:35:47,220 --> 00:35:49,220]  they don't know what they were doing, right?\n",
            "[00:35:49,220 --> 00:35:54,220]  How can you survive with a business model like that, right?\n",
            "[00:35:54,220 --> 00:35:58,220]  So you need to continue to invest in your capacity,\n",
            "[00:35:58,220 --> 00:36:02,220]  but then the more they use, you don't get more money.\n",
            "[00:36:02,220 --> 00:36:06,220]  So what kind of business can survive with that kind of model?\n",
            "[00:36:06,220 --> 00:36:09,220]  But anyway, but then we have technology change,\n",
            "[00:36:09,220 --> 00:36:12,220]  so that gives us like a refresh, right?\n",
            "[00:36:12,220 --> 00:36:15,220]  But then not everybody will just refresh at once.\n",
            "[00:36:15,220 --> 00:36:17,220]  That's why we need to do this migration.\n",
            "[00:36:17,220 --> 00:36:20,220]  But then thank you for bringing up that topic\n",
            "[00:36:20,220 --> 00:36:23,220]  and the thought about raising price on 4G.\n",
            "[00:36:23,220 --> 00:36:26,220]  I don't really think that's going to happen.\n",
            "[00:36:26,220 --> 00:36:27,220]  It's very hard.\n",
            "[00:36:27,220 --> 00:36:32,220]  We will be happy if they are willing to upgrade to 5G, you know,\n",
            "[00:36:32,220 --> 00:36:35,220]  and then that I'll be very happy.\n",
            "[00:36:36,220 --> 00:36:38,220]  So it's a good trend anyway.\n",
            "[00:36:38,220 --> 00:36:41,220]  I have a couple of other quicker questions.\n",
            "[00:36:41,220 --> 00:36:46,220]  One of them is on the merger and the regulatory approval for that.\n",
            "[00:36:46,220 --> 00:36:51,640]  Has there been any discussions of concessions being demanded for this?\n",
            "[00:36:51,640 --> 00:36:53,640]  I wouldn't think you would need it.\n",
            "[00:36:53,640 --> 00:36:55,640]  You're just going from five operators to four,\n",
            "[00:36:55,640 --> 00:36:58,800]  but sometimes regulators try to push in that direction.\n",
            "[00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:01,790]  No.\n",
            "[00:37:01,790 --> 00:37:05,790]  Actually, as I shared with you, from what I know,\n",
            "[00:37:05,790 --> 00:37:09,790]  the scholars actually, if not all of them,\n",
            "[00:37:09,790 --> 00:37:14,790]  I think the majority of them, definitely an absolute majority of them,\n",
            "[00:37:14,790 --> 00:37:16,790]  see the need.\n",
            "[00:37:16,790 --> 00:37:19,790]  See, this is not a case where, you know,\n",
            "[00:37:19,790 --> 00:37:23,790]  we have all companies that are doing well\n",
            "[00:37:23,790 --> 00:37:25,790]  and then just want to get bigger,\n",
            "[00:37:25,790 --> 00:37:28,790]  so two consolidate together or want to merge together.\n",
            "[00:37:28,790 --> 00:37:32,790]  In this case, we're talking about two small telcos\n",
            "[00:37:32,790 --> 00:37:35,790]  that just cannot survive.\n",
            "[00:37:35,790 --> 00:37:38,790]  They've been losing money for so long, right?\n",
            "[00:37:38,790 --> 00:37:42,790]  And then if this is really a free telecom industry,\n",
            "[00:37:42,790 --> 00:37:46,790]  you let people come in, you need to let people exit, right?\n",
            "[00:37:46,790 --> 00:37:50,790]  So this is not like I wanted to take over, you know,\n",
            "[00:37:50,790 --> 00:37:54,790]  APT or Taiwan Mobile wanted to take over Taiwan Star.\n",
            "[00:37:54,790 --> 00:37:58,790]  This is the small ones, they cannot really survive.\n",
            "[00:37:58,790 --> 00:38:03,790]  So this is a mutually, you know, the mutual agreement\n",
            "[00:38:03,790 --> 00:38:08,790]  and then they see the benefit, the mutual benefit of doing it.\n",
            "[00:38:08,790 --> 00:38:11,790]  Yeah, look at the best case scenario.\n",
            "[00:38:11,790 --> 00:38:15,020]  Right, and then the government would know, right?\n",
            "[00:38:15,020 --> 00:38:19,020]  It's the big companies like us that we are paying\n",
            "[00:38:19,020 --> 00:38:22,020]  to kind of clean up the industry, right?\n",
            "[00:38:22,020 --> 00:38:24,020]  Because otherwise they go bankrupt.\n",
            "[00:38:24,020 --> 00:38:27,020]  It's going to be the cost to the whole, to the government,\n",
            "[00:38:28,020 --> 00:38:30,020]  to, you know, every taxpayer.\n",
            "[00:38:30,020 --> 00:38:34,710]  So they should really thank us for that.\n",
            "[00:38:34,710 --> 00:38:37,710]  I'm glad that they feel the same way.\n",
            "[00:38:37,710 --> 00:38:41,710]  So far, yes, yes, they do see that, yeah.\n",
            "[00:38:41,710 --> 00:38:44,060]  And just one final question from me.\n",
            "[00:38:44,060 --> 00:38:48,060]  The 5G network slicing for the police,\n",
            "[00:38:48,060 --> 00:38:54,060]  what type of services are they getting out of that network slicing?\n",
            "[00:38:54,060 --> 00:39:00,380]  Okay, so if you are familiar with what's in the state,\n",
            "[00:39:00,380 --> 00:39:03,380]  so because I'm from AT&T, right?\n",
            "[00:39:03,380 --> 00:39:06,380]  So they have a network called FirstNet\n",
            "[00:39:06,380 --> 00:39:10,380]  and that is for kind of like a dedicated bandwidth\n",
            "[00:39:10,380 --> 00:39:12,380]  for first respondents.\n",
            "[00:39:12,380 --> 00:39:15,380]  So during, you know, disaster, right?\n",
            "[00:39:15,380 --> 00:39:19,380]  So the firefighters, the rescuers, police and all that,\n",
            "[00:39:19,380 --> 00:39:23,380]  they need to make sure their mobile communication\n",
            "[00:39:23,380 --> 00:39:28,380]  will not be, you know, affected by all the, you know,\n",
            "[00:39:28,380 --> 00:39:31,380]  majority of the users because during pandemics\n",
            "[00:39:31,380 --> 00:39:32,380]  everybody's calling, right?\n",
            "[00:39:32,380 --> 00:39:36,380]  So they need a dedicated bandwidth or spectrum\n",
            "[00:39:36,380 --> 00:39:39,380]  to support their communication doing that.\n",
            "[00:39:39,380 --> 00:39:43,380]  So this is actually, this is a, so I used that same idea\n",
            "[00:39:43,380 --> 00:39:46,380]  and I told my team, I said,\n",
            "[00:39:46,380 --> 00:39:50,380]  this is something you could do with our police department, right?\n",
            "[00:39:50,380 --> 00:39:53,380]  So the idea is that,\n",
            "[00:39:53,380 --> 00:39:56,380]  so they would have their dedicated spectrum.\n",
            "[00:39:56,380 --> 00:39:59,380]  So if this is going to be, you know, rolled out,\n",
            "[00:39:59,380 --> 00:40:00,380]  it wouldn't be just for one city.\n",
            "[00:40:00,380 --> 00:40:03,380]  This will be a nationwide kind of thing.\n",
            "[00:40:03,380 --> 00:40:05,380]  Then we started with Kaohsiung City.\n",
            "[00:40:05,380 --> 00:40:09,380]  So the application gets, you know, changed a little bit.\n",
            "[00:40:09,380 --> 00:40:12,380]  So they tried, they said before,\n",
            "[00:40:12,380 --> 00:40:15,380]  kind of have it totally dedicated.\n",
            "[00:40:15,380 --> 00:40:18,380]  They wanted to see if they can have dedicated,\n",
            "[00:40:18,380 --> 00:40:22,380]  they have a receiver in their car.\n",
            "[00:40:22,380 --> 00:40:25,380]  So they want to make sure the patrol cars, right,\n",
            "[00:40:25,380 --> 00:40:30,380]  the police and patrol cars have all that dedicated capacity\n",
            "[00:40:30,380 --> 00:40:33,380]  on the 5G with no lag and all that.\n",
            "[00:40:33,380 --> 00:40:35,380]  So in real time when they are chasing the criminals,\n",
            "[00:40:35,380 --> 00:40:38,380]  they get their information, their communication,\n",
            "[00:40:38,380 --> 00:40:40,380]  and all that without any interruption\n",
            "[00:40:40,380 --> 00:40:43,380]  or any possible congestion.\n",
            "[00:40:43,380 --> 00:40:46,380]  So this is, you know, kind of a modified,\n",
            "[00:40:46,380 --> 00:40:49,380]  a smaller scope of application to the FirstNet\n",
            "[00:40:49,380 --> 00:40:53,380]  that AT&T deployed in the States.\n",
            "[00:40:53,380 --> 00:40:55,380]  Although that was based on 4G,\n",
            "[00:40:55,380 --> 00:40:57,470]  and we are doing this with 5G.\n",
            "[00:40:57,470 --> 00:41:01,470]  But I stole that idea from my mother company before.\n",
            "[00:41:01,470 --> 00:41:03,470]  Well, yeah, well done.\n",
            "[00:41:03,470 --> 00:41:05,470]  Yeah, and thanks a lot for the answers.\n",
            "[00:41:05,470 --> 00:41:06,470]  That's been great.\n",
            "[00:41:06,470 --> 00:41:13,270]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:41:13,270 --> 00:41:16,270]  Next question is from Sarah Wan, UBS.\n",
            "[00:41:16,270 --> 00:41:17,270]  Go ahead, please.\n",
            "[00:41:17,270 --> 00:41:21,260]  Hi, thank you for the opportunity to ask a question.\n",
            "[00:41:21,260 --> 00:41:26,260]  So I have a question regarding new economy, say, business.\n",
            "[00:41:26,260 --> 00:41:31,260]  So how much percent of the enterprise-facing ICT revenue\n",
            "[00:41:31,260 --> 00:41:32,260]  is recurring?\n",
            "[00:41:32,260 --> 00:41:35,260]  And then so far it seems the growth momentum\n",
            "[00:41:35,260 --> 00:41:39,260]  of the overall new economy segment is quite robust.\n",
            "[00:41:39,260 --> 00:41:43,260]  Do you have any view or any plan of how much of the segment\n",
            "[00:41:43,260 --> 00:41:48,260]  could contribute to total revenue in maybe mid to long term?\n",
            "[00:41:48,260 --> 00:41:54,640]  Okay, so first question you are asking about the recurring.\n",
            "[00:41:54,640 --> 00:41:58,640]  So for ICT, actually, a big part of it is like,\n",
            "[00:41:58,640 --> 00:42:00,640]  my sales head would tell me,\n",
            "[00:42:00,640 --> 00:42:05,640]  every year on January 1st he feels most depressed\n",
            "[00:42:05,640 --> 00:42:09,640]  because all his revenue from last year has like reset, right?\n",
            "[00:42:09,640 --> 00:42:11,640]  They start from zero again.\n",
            "[00:42:11,640 --> 00:42:14,640]  That's what they were telling me in a dramatic way.\n",
            "[00:42:14,640 --> 00:42:17,640]  So that tells you, although, of course, we always have pipeline.\n",
            "[00:42:17,640 --> 00:42:19,640]  You have carryover from the year before.\n",
            "[00:42:19,640 --> 00:42:21,640]  You have contract assigned.\n",
            "[00:42:21,640 --> 00:42:28,860]  But then the point is, ICT business is like every single project,\n",
            "[00:42:28,860 --> 00:42:30,860]  that you got the project, you get it done,\n",
            "[00:42:30,860 --> 00:42:32,860]  you get a one-time revenue and all that.\n",
            "[00:42:32,860 --> 00:42:38,860]  However, more and more, and that's also part of our strategy,\n",
            "[00:42:38,860 --> 00:42:42,860]  we don't want this ICT to be only a one-time effort\n",
            "[00:42:42,860 --> 00:42:46,860]  because a lot of times after we have done what the customer asked for,\n",
            "[00:42:46,860 --> 00:42:50,860]  they will still need ongoing maintenance or management.\n",
            "[00:42:50,860 --> 00:42:56,860]  So then we will offer those like a maintenance service.\n",
            "[00:42:56,860 --> 00:43:01,860]  So that will be an ongoing subscription, kind of a recurring revenue.\n",
            "[00:43:01,860 --> 00:43:05,860]  But then compared to the size of it, like I said,\n",
            "[00:43:05,860 --> 00:43:10,860]  many of them were like over $100 million kind of a contract.\n",
            "[00:43:10,860 --> 00:43:14,860]  But then the recurring piece, of course, will be smaller ones.\n",
            "[00:43:15,860 --> 00:43:17,860]  But then those do add up.\n",
            "[00:43:17,860 --> 00:43:18,860]  They are recurring ones.\n",
            "[00:43:18,860 --> 00:43:19,860]  They add up.\n",
            "[00:43:19,860 --> 00:43:21,860]  So they become the base, right?\n",
            "[00:43:21,860 --> 00:43:26,860]  So every year starting January 1, we know they are not really starting from zero\n",
            "[00:43:26,860 --> 00:43:28,860]  because they already have that base.\n",
            "[00:43:28,860 --> 00:43:32,860]  You know, every year there's just so much that will come in,\n",
            "[00:43:32,860 --> 00:43:34,860]  the income, the revenue.\n",
            "[00:43:34,860 --> 00:43:39,860]  But then still, we are still at the early stage of building the ICT revenue.\n",
            "[00:43:39,860 --> 00:43:43,860]  So most part of it, they are not recurring\n",
            "[00:43:43,860 --> 00:43:44,860]  because they are one time.\n",
            "[00:43:44,860 --> 00:43:47,860]  And then they are each of those new projects\n",
            "[00:43:47,860 --> 00:43:49,860]  or second phase to the same project.\n",
            "[00:43:49,860 --> 00:43:54,860]  But we do see the base for these recurring is increasing,\n",
            "[00:43:54,860 --> 00:43:57,860]  and that's what we actually encourage our team to do,\n",
            "[00:43:57,860 --> 00:43:58,860]  and that's what we should do.\n",
            "[00:43:58,860 --> 00:44:02,860]  So, you know, we will see more there for the recurring part.\n",
            "[00:44:02,860 --> 00:44:03,860]  Okay.\n",
            "[00:44:03,860 --> 00:44:10,860]  And then your second question is about now we are about 18.9%, right?\n",
            "[00:44:10,860 --> 00:44:15,860]  And then how much higher it will grow to in the mid to long range.\n",
            "[00:44:15,860 --> 00:44:17,470]  Right?\n",
            "[00:44:17,470 --> 00:44:18,470]  That's your question?\n",
            "[00:44:18,470 --> 00:44:19,470]  Okay.\n",
            "[00:44:19,470 --> 00:44:30,820]  So I think in two to three years, I would like to see them, you know, 25%.\n",
            "[00:44:30,820 --> 00:44:38,820]  You know, my CFO is like, I'm not supposed to give that, right?\n",
            "[00:44:38,820 --> 00:44:39,820]  This is not a forecast, right?\n",
            "[00:44:39,820 --> 00:44:40,820]  I'm okay?\n",
            "[00:44:41,820 --> 00:44:43,820]  Well, I would like to, right?\n",
            "[00:44:43,820 --> 00:44:46,820]  So just kind of, you know, if you show the chart,\n",
            "[00:44:46,820 --> 00:44:50,820]  show the chart on the 5%, look at that.\n",
            "[00:44:50,820 --> 00:44:57,680]  So if you look at that, it's almost like every 2% grows from the previous, right?\n",
            "[00:44:57,680 --> 00:45:03,680]  So if you look at that, so I think in two, three years for 25%,\n",
            "[00:45:03,680 --> 00:45:08,680]  that is a good mid-range target, okay?\n",
            "[00:45:08,680 --> 00:45:12,710]  Because we are, we started with the telco, right?\n",
            "[00:45:12,710 --> 00:45:15,710]  And then that is still very consumer-based.\n",
            "[00:45:15,710 --> 00:45:16,710]  And the consumer-based is big.\n",
            "[00:45:16,710 --> 00:45:21,710]  We are talking about millions, right, 7 million worth of subscribers.\n",
            "[00:45:21,710 --> 00:45:27,710]  And after the merger is completed, we are talking about 9 million, right?\n",
            "[00:45:27,710 --> 00:45:32,710]  And then so we want to grow our consumer business, not just with the telecom,\n",
            "[00:45:32,710 --> 00:45:38,710]  but then also with other digital services, with more value-added services.\n",
            "[00:45:38,710 --> 00:45:41,710]  So that's how we continue to grow our pool.\n",
            "[00:45:41,710 --> 00:45:48,710]  With such a big base like that, I would still think the consumer part of the\n",
            "[00:45:48,710 --> 00:45:53,710]  services will still be the majority of our total revenue.\n",
            "[00:45:53,710 --> 00:46:01,800]  So 25%, if at one point, before I retire,\n",
            "[00:46:01,800 --> 00:46:04,800]  so I don't think it will become 40% or so.\n",
            "[00:46:04,800 --> 00:46:14,830]  For the long term, the pie will be very big when the ICT becomes 40%, I think.\n",
            "[00:46:14,830 --> 00:46:19,830]  So I think 25% to 30% would be good.\n",
            "[00:46:19,830 --> 00:46:26,830]  40% will be, we will have some major breakthrough or expansion\n",
            "[00:46:26,830 --> 00:46:30,830]  or maybe some M&A in the enterprise area.\n",
            "[00:46:30,830 --> 00:46:37,830]  But then right now, I think for the mid-term, 25%.\n",
            "[00:46:37,830 --> 00:46:41,830]  If you add another two years or a stretch, five years,\n",
            "[00:46:41,830 --> 00:46:46,830]  maybe 30% will be the top that I will be looking for.\n",
            "[00:46:46,830 --> 00:46:50,100]  Got it.\n",
            "[00:46:50,100 --> 00:46:51,100]  That's very clear.\n",
            "[00:46:51,100 --> 00:46:52,100]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:46:52,100 --> 00:46:53,200]  Thank you.\n",

            "[00:47:16,590 --> 00:47:31,970]  so maybe that was ‚Äì and later on, they can always come with further details.\n",

            "[00:47:35,280 --> 00:47:41,800]  And I think there are currently no questions,\n",
            "[00:47:41,800 --> 00:47:45,150]  and I'll pass the call back to Mr. Gary Lai.\n",

            "[00:01:17,710 --> 00:01:27,550]  performance. As you can see what's on the board, that the major KPI, we are beating all the guidance\n",
            "[00:01:28,190 --> 00:01:33,740]  across all KPIs. And not only that, but we also posted positive and good\n",
            "[00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:43,100]  growth, including the revenue for 5.1%. We also showed the guidance for the annual.\n",
            "[00:01:43,100 --> 00:01:51,180]  So, you can see for this year, 2022, we are looking at 88.789 billion of revenue. And then,\n",
            "[00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:58,940]  that is about 4.1% of worldwide compared to last year's actual. And this quarter,\n",
            "[00:01:58,940 --> 00:02:09,040]  we already posted 5.1%. And then, for the EBITDA, it's 11.3%. And also, for the net income in EPS,\n",
            "[00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:14,560]  it's a pretty impressive 28.4%. So, I cannot complain. All right, next slide, please.\n",
            "[00:02:16,450 --> 00:02:25,170]  All right. So, on the revenue side, since we have launched 5G in 2020, you could see that very\n",
            "[00:02:25,170 --> 00:02:34,050]  soon, we led our industry in showing the positive trend on the revenue. So, it has been six quarters\n",
            "[00:02:34,050 --> 00:02:41,810]  in a row now. The total revenue has turned worldwide positive. And then, on the EBITDA side,\n",
            "[00:02:42,770 --> 00:02:52,450]  we have posted 11.3% worldwide growth. And that is the record high since the fourth quarter,\n",
            "[00:02:52,450 --> 00:03:02,910]  2018. So, as you can see from the chart, in terms of the growth percent, and this quarter has...\n",
            "[00:03:02,910 --> 00:03:08,960]  And of course, this is taking last year, the third quarter, right? The third quarter,\n",
            "[00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:15,280]  where we had a one-time building sale. So, excluded that. And then, this is the highest,\n",
            "[00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:22,000]  11.3%. That was on the EPS side. Okay. Yeah. So, for the net income, that is also...\n",
            "[00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:29,200]  I think it addressed all the way back to 2018, third quarter as well. And it is the highest.\n",
            "[00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:36,500]  And what I was referring to, the third quarter, 21, that we have that one-time sale. If we exclude\n",
            "[00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:44,990]  that, it is equivalent to 0.64 for that quarter. So, with that, and then this 0.71 is so far.\n",
            "[00:03:50,750 --> 00:03:57,630]  Yeah. And in terms of the debt, so, you can see that we continue to pay down our borrowing. So,\n",
            "[00:03:57,630 --> 00:04:06,590]  the net debt has decreased to 52.5 billion or so. And net debt to EBITDA multiple has come down to\n",
            "[00:04:06,590 --> 00:04:18,110]  1.82 as well. And then, we continue to have a very healthy cash flow at 55.1 billion or so.\n",
            "[00:04:18,990 --> 00:04:29,070]  And the CapEx, for this year, our CapEx guidance is about 11.1 billion, of which 2 billion is\n",
            "[00:04:29,070 --> 00:04:37,180]  carried over from last year. But then, so far, we have spent 2.3 or so. So, it is in line with\n",
            "[00:04:37,180 --> 00:04:48,530]  our guidance. Yeah. So, what has contributed to our very good first record results from the core\n",
            "[00:04:48,530 --> 00:04:55,090]  business, that is our mobile service? So, we see very favorable mobile service trends. And that's\n",
            "[00:04:55,090 --> 00:05:02,050]  reflected in our pool, the post-PAR pool in particular. So, you see, we continue to grow our\n",
            "[00:05:02,050 --> 00:05:08,430]  pool. Of course, 5G is a big contributor there. And then, so, the monthly fee for 5G renewal,\n",
            "[00:05:08,430 --> 00:05:16,830]  we continue to see greater than 20% uplift. And then, on the mobile service revenue part,\n",
            "[00:05:16,830 --> 00:05:26,510]  it is also a 2.3% YOY. This may not seem a lot because it's single digit 2.3%. But as you all\n",
            "[00:05:26,510 --> 00:05:33,390]  might be aware, right, for years, the mobile service revenue in the industry has been declining.\n",
            "[00:05:33,390 --> 00:05:40,350]  So, we are happy to see the upturn since we launched the 5G. And this trend continues.\n",
            "[00:05:40,350 --> 00:05:48,510]  And then, in terms of the 5G post-pay penetration, we are now at 5% of penetration and it has been\n",
            "[00:05:48,510 --> 00:05:58,370]  steady. And in terms of the post-pay churn rate, even though with the two merger announcements,\n",
            "[00:05:58,370 --> 00:06:05,250]  so, the market gets a little bit more exciting than usual. But still, we keep the churn rate\n",
            "[00:06:05,250 --> 00:06:11,420]  relatively low level. And of course, our main goal is to continue to work it down.\n",
            "[00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:27,300]  And then, on the new economy side, which we have as our growth engine, and it does show its strength.\n",
            "[00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:35,920]  So, for this first quarter, the new economy, it grew like 27.2% year over year. And then, just,\n",
            "[00:06:38,700 --> 00:06:47,630]  so, the new economy revenue account for 80.4% of our total revenue received in the first quarter.\n",
            "[00:06:47,630 --> 00:06:55,630]  So, that is double-digit worldwide growth and then, you know, almost 30%. So, that was very\n",
            "[00:06:55,630 --> 00:07:03,500]  strong. And on the enterprise side, it accounts for more than half of the new economy revenue\n",

            "[00:07:10,940 --> 00:07:18,140]  we can break it down to the cloud service. And that has shown a 66% worldwide growth. And then,\n",
            "[00:07:18,140 --> 00:07:27,100]  for the IoT solutions that are used in smart city or so, it shows 84% worldwide growth as well.\n",
            "[00:07:28,020 --> 00:07:35,820]  And then, on the consumer side, out of all the digital services, the two upfront that are driving\n",
            "[00:07:35,820 --> 00:07:46,560]  more of the growth are in the e-commerce and also our consumer IoT also did very well in the first\n",
            "[00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:53,360]  quarter. And the major milestones we have achieved year to date, that included we have issued the\n",
            "[00:07:53,360 --> 00:08:01,040]  first social bonds in Taiwan telecom industry for $2.7 billion for financing 5G on the ESG\n",
            "[00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:10,160]  development. And also, we have started a 5G Metaverse Accelerator in December. And after\n",
            "[00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:16,020]  several months of working with the teams and assessment and evaluation and all that, now\n",
            "[00:08:16,020 --> 00:08:23,540]  selected 20 of them to continue to work with us to co-create and co-develop some go-to-market\n",
            "[00:08:23,540 --> 00:08:31,860]  business applications. And of course, with the focus on the FET users and also the enterprise\n",
            "[00:08:31,860 --> 00:08:37,780]  clients as well. So, in September, we'll have a demo of the joint efforts results that we have\n",
            "[00:08:37,780 --> 00:08:45,780]  from these 20 teams. And also, we are invited by Ericsson to join their global startup 5G program.\n",
            "[00:08:45,780 --> 00:08:53,860]  And this is a program where they connected those startups globally where they have focused\n",
            "[00:08:53,860 --> 00:08:59,540]  on 5G-related applications. And people are saying, what is the 5G killer application?\n",
            "[00:08:59,540 --> 00:09:05,300]  So, certainly, I know there is a community working on that. So, Ericsson is trying to bring\n",
            "[00:09:05,300 --> 00:09:12,400]  them together and also invite Telco to join. And we are the first one so far that joined from\n",
            "[00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:20,480]  the East Asia. This program will also help the startups that we have selected to work with us\n",
            "[00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:25,520]  through our accelerator. We can expose them to this global community as well for more\n",
            "[00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:31,380]  collaboration opportunities. So, we are happy to see this development as well.\n",
            "[00:09:31,380 --> 00:09:39,540]  And finally, although this is not, you know, FET's part, but then still it's very relevant\n",
            "[00:09:39,540 --> 00:09:47,460]  because in light of the merger plan. So, we are happy to see that APT's shareholders\n",
            "[00:09:47,460 --> 00:09:58,640]  have approved this FET and APT merger proposal on April 15th. Okay. All right. And then we have\n",
            "[00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:07,600]  a few more awards and recognition that we received here today. The top three are for the ESG-related\n",
            "[00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:13,840]  efforts. And the bottom two are more innovation and our solution, you know, oriented,\n",
            "[00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:24,880]  especially in our IOT and using AI-enabled quality management system. So, not only we continue to\n",
            "[00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:33,840]  work on our ESG-related efforts and work, and then also we are very keen on promoting our\n",
            "[00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:40,480]  homegrown solutions as we go deeper in these newer technologies. So, receiving these awards\n",
            "[00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:46,160]  are very positive confirmation of the direction and also of our efforts. So, we are happy about\n",
            "[00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:52,700]  that and to share that with you. Okay. And finally, I think this is my final slide.\n",
            "[00:10:52,700 --> 00:10:59,260]  And this time we kind of changed a little bit. So, we want to make it more like a crisp and so,\n",
            "[00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:05,100]  and spare you with a lot of charts and then make it a little bit cleaner and shorter.\n",
            "[00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:12,940]  And so, just to recap, for FET 2022 priorities, we will continue to strengthen and grow core\n",
            "[00:11:12,940 --> 00:11:19,500]  business. You know, as we said, even though telecom or people may think of it as a legacy,\n",
            "[00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:26,780]  but then with FIG, we certainly see, you know, a lot of the trends are showing positive signs.\n",
            "[00:11:26,780 --> 00:11:32,700]  And then so, we will continue to grow our core business. And then, on the other hand,\n",
            "[00:11:33,420 --> 00:11:43,100]  our new growth areas in the new economy, they are very much related to the technology strength that\n",
            "[00:11:43,100 --> 00:11:51,820]  we have. So, we have combined our transformation office with our IT department to form information\n",
            "[00:11:51,820 --> 00:11:59,900]  and digital transformation technology division. And I recruited this AI leader from, AI cloud\n",
            "[00:11:59,900 --> 00:12:08,860]  leader from Microsoft, Peter Hu. So, we have scaled up our technical forces so that we have\n",
            "[00:12:08,860 --> 00:12:16,670]  dedicated teams to help to support our enterprise solutions as well as our digital services. And\n",
            "[00:12:16,670 --> 00:12:22,830]  then so that we can drive more new growth. Okay. And also, we have always considered, you know,\n",
            "[00:12:22,830 --> 00:12:30,460]  our customer, what are our clients to our customers and what is the differentiator we can\n",
            "[00:12:30,460 --> 00:12:36,220]  provide. So, we'll continue to grow our customer relationships and then provide more value\n",
            "[00:12:36,220 --> 00:12:46,700]  to FET customers. And I always emphasize with my team that, you know, if we can save one dollar,\n",
            "[00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:54,060]  it is like we are making $10 worth of business. So, this is important that we need to drive down\n",
            "[00:12:54,060 --> 00:13:00,700]  our operational costs and expenses using automation, using more process improvement.\n",
            "[00:13:00,700 --> 00:13:07,660]  So, we'll continue to do that. And then, last but not least, because of the merger. So, of course,\n",
            "[00:13:07,660 --> 00:13:15,180]  this is, you know, new or additional efforts and definitely our priority that we need to pursue\n",
            "[00:13:15,180 --> 00:13:24,860]  this regulatory approval for FET and APT merger. And also, in June, on June 14th, we will have our\n",
            "[00:13:24,860 --> 00:13:33,500]  FET annual shareholders meeting held on that day. With that, that concludes my presentation for you\n",
            "[00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:40,990]  all. And then we are happy to take questions. Thank you, President Xi. And ladies and gentlemen,\n",
            "[00:13:40,990 --> 00:13:46,830]  we will now begin our question and answer session. If you have a question for any of today's speakers,\n",
            "[00:13:46,830 --> 00:13:52,750]  please press 01 on your telephone keypad and you will enter the queue. After you are announced,\n",
            "[00:13:52,750 --> 00:13:57,710]  please ask your question. If you find that your question has been answered before it is your turn\n",
            "[00:13:57,710 --> 00:14:04,590]  to speak, please press 02 to cancel the question. Thank you. Now, please press 01 to ask the\n",
            "[00:14:04,590 --> 00:14:12,580]  question. Thank you. Our first question is coming from Peter Milliken of Deutsche Bank. Go ahead,\n",
            "[00:14:12,580 --> 00:14:20,180]  please. Good afternoon. Thanks for the call and congratulations on a great result. My question is\n",
            "[00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:30,350]  perhaps a little bit mathematical, but what it is is 5G APU is up 20% or more on the migration.\n",
            "[00:14:31,790 --> 00:14:40,080]  And if I look at how 5G users have trended right up to 25% of the user base now, then I can\n",
            "[00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:47,600]  basically estimate that the first quarter, maybe on a weighted average basis, 5G users were at least\n",
            "[00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:56,610]  20% of the user base. So then if I multiply 20% APU increase by 20% of the user base on average,\n",
            "[00:14:57,340 --> 00:15:03,520]  then I would come to a 4% increase in postpaid APU. But actually, since 5G is being launched,\n",
            "[00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:12,160]  the increase is a little bit less than 2%. So that would suggest to me that maybe the non-5G\n",
            "[00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:18,910]  users are spending less. Would that be the correct interpretation or is there something else\n",
            "[00:15:19,470 --> 00:15:31,730]  that I'm missing out on? Okay. So you have, let me see, you have used several numbers together\n",
            "[00:15:31,730 --> 00:15:39,810]  to derive your final question. You said the 4G have spent less. Is that what you're saying?\n",
            "[00:15:40,450 --> 00:15:43,650]  Yeah, that's right. I mean, like basically to put it another way,\n",
            "[00:15:44,210 --> 00:15:49,970]  if I was to extrapolate out to when you have all your users on 5G, should I be expecting\n",
            "[00:15:49,970 --> 00:15:55,650]  something near a 20% APU uplift or would it be a lower number? Because it seems like that's not\n",
            "[00:15:55,650 --> 00:16:03,380]  coming through in your postpaid APU on the run rate basis. So to answer your question,\n",
            "[00:16:03,380 --> 00:16:13,620]  I think your observation was basically correct. Okay. So if we look at the, so some of these,\n",
            "[00:16:13,620 --> 00:16:19,700]  when we calculate the renewal uplift, we're only speaking to those that we convert. But then at\n",
            "[00:16:19,700 --> 00:16:26,180]  the same time, we also could have some growth ads that didn't, that wasn't with us, right? So to us,\n",
            "[00:16:26,180 --> 00:16:32,500]  those are not calculated in this uplift space. Okay. So there is a difference there for your\n",
            "[00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:41,140]  information. And then also your overwrite for the ones that are still stay on 4G, right? Because\n",
            "[00:16:41,140 --> 00:16:47,620]  our initial strategy, we convert those already on a higher rate plane because they are more like\n",
            "[00:16:49,140 --> 00:16:55,780]  adoptive. They are new early adopters, right? So we go for those. And then as you know,\n",
            "[00:16:55,780 --> 00:17:01,140]  they already on the higher rate plane. So in terms of the uplift, actually, that would be\n",
            "[00:17:01,140 --> 00:17:11,060]  relatively smaller. So ironically, if I were able to convert someone with 499 or 599 to a 1399\n",
            "[00:17:11,060 --> 00:17:20,740]  5G program or 1199 5G program, the uplift will be bigger. But then it is also more challenging\n",
            "[00:17:20,740 --> 00:17:28,580]  to convince those that are currently at the mid-rate or the lower rate plane. So it is a\n",
            "[00:17:28,580 --> 00:17:36,900]  mixed kind of a juggle. But then overall, this uplift that the 5G is able to contribute\n",
            "[00:17:36,900 --> 00:17:43,870]  is definitely a very positive thing. But hey, thanks for helping me solve that mystery.\n",
            "[00:17:43,870 --> 00:17:50,510]  Did that make sense? No problem. But you already have seen a lot more detail than I could. Actually,\n",
            "[00:17:50,510 --> 00:17:55,310]  I didn't mix all these numbers together. But then you are right on target. Yeah.\n",
            "[00:17:57,060 --> 00:17:59,060]  Thank you. Okay, sure.\n",
            "[00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:06,720]  And next, we'll have Neil Anderson of HSBC for questions. Go ahead, please.\n",
            "[00:18:08,270 --> 00:18:15,870]  Thank you. Good afternoon. I have two questions on costs, please, and relates to your last slide\n",
            "[00:18:15,870 --> 00:18:20,750]  in terms of driving down operational costs and expenses. It looks like in the first quarter,\n",
            "[00:18:20,750 --> 00:18:26,110]  you have potentially some pretty good operating leverage in the core telecom business. So\n",
            "[00:18:26,110 --> 00:18:31,870]  my question on that part is what additional costs can you take out? You mentioned automation,\n",
            "[00:18:31,870 --> 00:18:36,590]  etc. But I'm wondering which specific cost areas do you see the most opportunity?\n",
            "[00:18:37,470 --> 00:18:41,950]  Then the second part of the question relates to the cost trend in the new economy business\n",
            "[00:18:42,670 --> 00:18:48,830]  and how you see that panning out. Do you think costs can flatten or decline? Or do you expect\n",
            "[00:18:48,830 --> 00:18:53,550]  them to grow in line with revenues in this early stage of that business? Thank you.\n",
            "[00:18:56,020 --> 00:19:06,460]  Okay. So I think when I joined Far Eastern, that was 2018, we actually had early retirement kind\n",
            "[00:19:06,460 --> 00:19:12,540]  of a program that we encouraged some of the employees to take early retirement and all that.\n",
            "[00:19:12,540 --> 00:19:18,220]  In other words, that was trimming down our workforce. And it has been three, four years now.\n",
            "[00:19:18,220 --> 00:19:24,460]  And then I have some employees asking if we have some program like that. I think sooner or later,\n",
            "[00:19:24,540 --> 00:19:32,860]  and also in anticipation of this merger, right? So I think it is actually a good time for us to\n",
            "[00:19:32,860 --> 00:19:41,020]  look further in terms of if we have the right size for where we want to be. And also if we have the\n",
            "[00:19:41,020 --> 00:19:47,340]  right talent at the right post. So this is more of an overall kind of from the HR perspective.\n",
            "[00:19:47,340 --> 00:19:54,620]  I think there's definitely there's more leaning that we can do. Although I certainly don't want to\n",
            "[00:19:54,620 --> 00:20:02,780]  publicize this to get any of my employees nervous, but it is. So in addition to OPEX in terms of\n",
            "[00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:09,100]  entertainment, travel, those kinds of miscellaneous kind of things, but it is also\n",
            "[00:20:09,580 --> 00:20:19,970]  in the non-media standing area, that is where I consider some area we can have more scrubbing.\n",
            "[00:20:20,610 --> 00:20:25,890]  But then I'll just be very candid. I think from time to time, it is only healthy\n",
            "[00:20:25,890 --> 00:20:31,090]  for the organization to look at the company size and the company structure,\n",
            "[00:20:31,970 --> 00:20:39,250]  especially we are going to have a merger. So I wouldn't be surprised that I see areas where\n",
            "[00:20:39,250 --> 00:20:46,850]  we can prune ourselves a little bit more. Okay. I think that's your first question.\n",
            "[00:20:46,850 --> 00:20:53,730]  And then the second question is about in the new business area, do I see how I would\n",
            "[00:20:53,730 --> 00:21:01,890]  cut the cost there? Well, so in the new growth area, as I mentioned, we really took pride in\n",
            "[00:21:01,890 --> 00:21:10,450]  developing a big driver for the homegrown is to improve our margins, right? And then so\n",
            "[00:21:10,450 --> 00:21:15,890]  especially on the software area, and then those are reusable. And then so the same\n",
            "[00:21:16,690 --> 00:21:22,450]  solution like energy management systems, for example, or the telemedicine or some\n",
            "[00:21:22,450 --> 00:21:29,170]  smart CD, smart tracking, monitoring kinds of capabilities, those can be reused. And we use\n",
            "[00:21:29,730 --> 00:21:37,410]  IoT platforms, so not everything needs to start from scratch. So the more cases or the more\n",
            "[00:21:37,410 --> 00:21:43,410]  projects or deals that we are able to make in this area, these software are just reusable. So\n",
            "[00:21:43,410 --> 00:21:50,210]  my margin will only improve. So I do see just by that, you know, the cost, the relative\n",
            "[00:21:50,210 --> 00:21:54,690]  average cost will go down. And then that will improve our margin as well.\n",
            "[00:21:57,570 --> 00:22:04,770]  Got it. Thank you. On the first part, the cost in the core business, can I ask how much is\n",
            "[00:22:04,770 --> 00:22:10,690]  retail and distribution? And there's one thing in Hong Kong we've noticed since or during COVID is\n",

            "[00:22:16,850 --> 00:22:22,290]  store footprint, switching more to digital marketing. I was wondering if that is feasible\n",
            "[00:22:23,010 --> 00:22:28,140]  for Far Eastern as well. That's certainly, you know, like we call it our,\n",
            "[00:22:29,100 --> 00:22:36,060]  you know, kind of channel 2.0. So that is the, you know, towards more digital is the goal of that.\n",
            "[00:22:36,060 --> 00:22:42,140]  But it hasn't been a priority in the past. But then through this pandemic impact, we definitely\n",

            "[00:22:57,660 --> 00:23:05,420]  as to have a strategy or more aggressive in terms of the digital, using the digital channel.\n",
            "[00:23:05,420 --> 00:23:13,260]  So we have been in planning and looking at how we scale down on the number of our retail stores,\n",
            "[00:23:13,260 --> 00:23:17,580]  whether it's franchise or our direct retail stores. And so that is in the works.\n",

            "[00:23:23,490 --> 00:23:29,410]  Thank you. We are now in question and answer session. If you would like to ask the question,\n",
            "[00:23:29,410 --> 00:23:37,970]  please press 01 on your telephone keypad. Thank you. And this question is coming from 01 of UBS.\n",
            "[00:23:37,970 --> 00:23:38,690]  Go ahead, please.\n",
            "[00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:46,560]  Hi, thank you for the opportunity to ask questions. I have two questions. First is regarding the new\n",
            "[00:23:46,560 --> 00:23:53,920]  economy business. May I ask how's the margin profile so far? And then it seems the growth is\n",
            "[00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:59,760]  very solid for the past few quarters. Do you see increasing or how's the competition landscape\n",
            "[00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:05,760]  going forward given we are not only competing with Taocodes, but also other tech firms?\n",
            "[00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:14,720]  And also, the second question is regarding the timeline of APT merger. So it seems the\n",
            "[00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:21,040]  shareholder meeting of our zone is in June. And then when do we expect the regulatory approval,\n",
            "[00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:25,470]  like you said, this year, fourth quarter, et cetera? Thank you.\n",
            "[00:24:26,670 --> 00:24:34,430]  Okay. Hi, Sarah. So for the first question, yes. So for ICT, you know, it depends on project\n",
            "[00:24:34,430 --> 00:24:39,740]  per project and then also the size of the project. So the margin varies. But then on the average,\n",
            "[00:24:39,820 --> 00:24:46,220]  we see between 15 to 20 percent. So that's the growth margin we see with ICT.\n",
            "[00:24:47,420 --> 00:24:57,580]  And then in terms of the competition, I think certainly it is not better than\n",
            "[00:24:58,780 --> 00:25:05,020]  two years ago. But the difference is we are stronger and we are more mature in this area\n",
            "[00:25:05,020 --> 00:25:09,900]  as opposed to two years ago. We kind of just started in this area. But then in two years,\n",
            "[00:25:09,900 --> 00:25:16,140]  we have, you know, built a lot of experience and then delivered a lot of good projects.\n",
            "[00:25:16,140 --> 00:25:23,020]  That is like to give us a very positive energy and then the feedback and all that. So even though\n",
            "[00:25:23,020 --> 00:25:30,860]  the market is still just as competitive, but then we are more competitive ourselves. So I think\n",
            "[00:25:30,860 --> 00:25:39,420]  it worked out fine. And in terms of our ability to win projects and that is also improving. So\n",
            "[00:25:41,020 --> 00:25:47,740]  I'm pleased with what I see now. And then the trend also on the private network, we see\n",
            "[00:25:47,740 --> 00:25:54,460]  quite a bit of demand is coming. So this takes a little bit, you know, since we launched 5G,\n",
            "[00:25:54,460 --> 00:26:01,340]  we already were talking about private networks. But it did need some time to cook, to kind of\n",
            "[00:26:02,660 --> 00:26:11,540]  educate or make the enterprise more comfortable or get them more acquainted with this technology\n",
            "[00:26:11,540 --> 00:26:17,700]  and with what the 5G private network can do for them. And with some, you know, cases that we had\n",
            "[00:26:17,700 --> 00:26:23,460]  deployed, I think the stories got told more and people hear them more. So we actually have seen\n",
            "[00:26:23,460 --> 00:26:29,540]  quite a bit of a demand in this area. And they had a few, quite a few contracts signed in the\n",
            "[00:26:29,540 --> 00:26:39,150]  first quarter as well. So I see this ICT will continue to grow. Okay, your second question\n",
            "[00:26:39,150 --> 00:26:47,630]  is about APC. In terms of a timeframe, it's really, well, I can at least tell you we,\n",
            "[00:26:47,950 --> 00:26:59,070]  there was hope that maybe it can get approved by NCC in July-August timeframe just because the\n",
            "[00:26:59,070 --> 00:27:07,150]  committee members, like four of the committee members of NCC will change shifts. Their term\n",
            "[00:27:07,150 --> 00:27:15,070]  expires. So the new members will be inaugurated in August. So you would think with that changeover,\n",
            "[00:27:15,070 --> 00:27:21,070]  either you finish this before then or you wait until the new members to join to finish.\n",
            "[00:27:21,070 --> 00:27:31,630]  So that is a key factor to see if there's a chance to get approved by NCC before end of July,\n",
            "[00:27:31,630 --> 00:27:40,430]  then, you know, FTC would usually follow after that. But then, you know, so we don't know at\n",
            "[00:27:40,430 --> 00:27:48,110]  this time for sure. But then even if it would happen in July, that probably will be a record\n",
            "[00:27:48,110 --> 00:27:56,590]  speed because usually it would take longer. So we're still hoping we will be able to complete\n",
            "[00:27:56,590 --> 00:28:02,750]  this merger by the end of the year. And I think that is still, so far, still a reasonable target.\n",
            "[00:28:03,710 --> 00:28:11,070]  Even if we, so between July and September, hopefully, we will see the approvals,\n",
            "[00:28:11,070 --> 00:28:17,390]  we'll receive the approvals. But that's kind of the timeframe we are hoping for. But it,\n",
            "[00:28:17,390 --> 00:28:23,470]  as these are all government-related agencies, we really don't have influence on how fast they will\n",
            "[00:28:23,470 --> 00:28:30,030]  work this. But then we are collaborating with them. And every time they ask for information,\n",
            "[00:28:30,030 --> 00:28:36,030]  we will get back to them promptly. So that's the kind of things that we can do and then\n",
            "[00:28:36,030 --> 00:28:41,390]  to help accelerate. But then really, they are the ones that determine how fast and how soon.\n",
            "[00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:45,200]  Got it. Thank you.\n",
            "[00:28:46,190 --> 00:28:46,430]  Sure.\n",

            "[00:05:55,760 --> 00:06:01,760]  That's our position and we did pay for this location and then for competitive advantage.\n",
            "[00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:08,760]  And then the 28G area that combined with APT who is right next to us is the 800 megahertz.\n",
            "[00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:15,620]  Okay. All right. So continue with the emerging synergies.\n",
            "[00:06:15,620 --> 00:06:22,620]  Number three is the significant network capital and OPEC savings because we can increase our\n",
            "[00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:28,620]  radio capacity without additional capital investment or little. And then we can also\n",
            "[00:06:28,620 --> 00:06:33,620]  combine existing Ericsson equipment for the matching spectrum for reuse. That's why\n",
            "[00:06:33,620 --> 00:06:41,620]  this matching is very important. So all from GT or APT spectrum are matching with what\n",
            "[00:06:41,620 --> 00:06:46,620]  we have. It's a subset with what we have. So that gives us this additional advantage.\n",
            "[00:06:46,620 --> 00:06:51,620]  You know, reuse the equipment because it's the same spectrum and you just double up the\n",
            "[00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:56,620]  capacity. And then for the end you only need one set of equipment. So we can scale back\n",
            "[00:06:56,620 --> 00:07:04,620]  on our growth for additional equipment needs just by reusing what APT already has.\n",
            "[00:07:05,620 --> 00:07:11,620]  And then also in terms of the annual support, maintenance cost, optimization cost, and\n",
            "[00:07:11,620 --> 00:07:16,620]  then, you know, those are big dollars you pay to the vendors. And then also operation\n",
            "[00:07:16,620 --> 00:07:23,780]  and expenses cost from network consolidation and mobile rent, core transport networks included.\n",
            "[00:07:23,780 --> 00:07:25,780]  So that's a lot of savings there.\n",
            "[00:07:25,780 --> 00:07:32,780]  And also we see that the backbone coverage is strengthened, right, and enhanced as I\n",
            "[00:07:32,780 --> 00:07:38,780]  mentioned briefly on the previous slide. And also in terms of the IT transit and peering\n",
            "[00:07:38,780 --> 00:07:44,780]  cost, APT has a higher unit cost and then probably because of their scale. But then\n",
            "[00:07:44,780 --> 00:07:51,780]  once combined with us and all these costs will be at a lower unit cost. So that's\n",
            "[00:07:51,780 --> 00:07:53,780]  additional savings as well.\n",
            "[00:07:53,780 --> 00:07:59,780]  Okay. And then those are just looking at how we can improve the efficiency of the capital\n",
            "[00:07:59,780 --> 00:08:06,780]  by the scale and also by consolidating and saving on the capital investment as well as\n",
            "[00:08:06,780 --> 00:08:12,780]  the OPEX spending. And then if you look at on the upside in terms of for growing the\n",
            "[00:08:12,780 --> 00:08:17,780]  additional revenue, of course with the broader customer base, you know, that is a bigger\n",
            "[00:08:17,780 --> 00:08:24,780]  base for us to do the 5G conversion or just to upsell. So that will contribute to the\n",
            "[00:08:24,780 --> 00:08:29,780]  uplift and of course the telecom revenue and also the RPO.\n",
            "[00:08:29,780 --> 00:08:36,810]  And then in terms of additional that is cross-selling, FET does have digital services and in\n",
            "[00:08:36,810 --> 00:08:42,810]  addition to the Friday video music, Friday shopping, and then also since a year ago we\n",
            "[00:08:42,810 --> 00:08:49,810]  launched MoveX Circle. That is to have quite a bit of co-creation with our alliance that\n",
            "[00:08:49,810 --> 00:08:55,810]  provide additional services for our users to consume. So all those, you know, by\n",
            "[00:08:55,810 --> 00:09:01,810]  combining with APT, the user base has been broadened and then we look at this is\n",
            "[00:09:01,810 --> 00:09:06,810]  additional cross-selling opportunities for us and additional digital services revenue\n",
            "[00:09:06,810 --> 00:09:07,810]  accordingly.\n",
            "[00:09:07,810 --> 00:09:15,160]  Okay. Next slide. All right. And then also on the enterprise side, APT has good\n",
            "[00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:20,160]  performance. The fixed asset and then also I mentioned, you know, the fiber asset as\n",
            "[00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:28,160]  well. So and then they have been working in this enterprise ICT, the smart devices area\n",
            "[00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:34,160]  as well. So we do see the synergy by combining the two companies, the two workforce to\n",
            "[00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:40,160]  grow this and continue to grow enterprise ICT and fixed data business. And as you may\n",
            "[00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:46,160]  recall or you will see that later in my presentation for the BAU 2021 performance, our\n",
            "[00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:54,160]  smart ICT continues to be our growth engine and drive our revenue growth very nicely.\n",
            "[00:09:54,160 --> 00:10:02,190]  Okay. And of course with the Foxconn support behind APT, so we see more Foxconn and\n",
            "[00:10:03,190 --> 00:10:11,190]  FET collaboration opportunities. And then also combined the two networks together with\n",
            "[00:10:11,190 --> 00:10:18,190]  this additional spectrum, you know, assets and then also the one network and we can\n",
            "[00:10:18,190 --> 00:10:25,480]  expect to improve customer experience. And also last but not least, we'd like to\n",
            "[00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:33,480]  improve the environmental sustainability. Everybody knows that the radio stations, they\n",
            "[00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:39,480]  consume a lot of electricity which we are really short of in Taiwan. And then so what\n",
            "[00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:45,480]  we could do as a telco industry is we can do more consolidation and then make all these\n",
            "[00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:51,480]  network investment and then electricity use more efficient, right? We really cannot afford\n",
            "[00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:57,480]  not to think about all that. And then so by combining two companies together, we are\n",
            "[00:10:57,480 --> 00:11:04,480]  looking to consolidate two 5G cores into one and we could consolidate two 4G networks\n",
            "[00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:10,480]  into one. And then also greater than 90% of APT cell sites can be consolidated with\n",
            "[00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:16,480]  FET. This is not only good for the environmental sustainability, of course that means a\n",
            "[00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:25,230]  lot of dollar savings as well. Okay, with that, I sum up energy for you all. Okay, we\n",
            "[00:11:25,230 --> 00:11:32,230]  can have a Q&A after I finish the rest of the presentation if you don't mind. So I\n",
            "[00:11:32,230 --> 00:11:37,230]  will continue with our fourth quarter and four year performance overview for you.\n",
            "[00:11:37,230 --> 00:11:45,900]  All right, so we have very solid fourth quarter last year and as you could see across\n",
            "[00:11:45,900 --> 00:11:52,900]  from total revenue EBITDA or net income and EPS, YOY is all positive, you know, close\n",
            "[00:11:52,900 --> 00:11:58,900]  to 5% growth across the board. And then in terms of the full year, right, we actually\n",
            "[00:11:58,900 --> 00:12:08,900]  achieved 85.3 billion revenue and that is 7.3% year over year growth. And in terms of\n",
            "[00:12:09,900 --> 00:12:16,900]  our target achievement, it's 103.7%. And then if you look down, so our EBITDA is also\n",
            "[00:12:16,900 --> 00:12:24,900]  increased by both from the achieved rate and also the YOY is about 2% growth and our net\n",
            "[00:12:24,900 --> 00:12:34,900]  income increased 9.2% and so is the EPS 2.8. Against our target that was 2.56 and I do\n",
            "[00:12:34,900 --> 00:12:40,900]  want to remind everybody, the sale of our one building was accountable when we set the\n",
            "[00:12:40,900 --> 00:12:48,900]  target last year for 2021 target 2.56. So we definitely, you know, outperformed our\n",
            "[00:12:48,900 --> 00:12:57,510]  own target by almost 10%, so 9%. Okay, all right, and then continue with our financial\n",
            "[00:12:57,510 --> 00:13:02,510]  performance. So if you look at that, we have improved our net debt and net debt to EBITDA\n",
            "[00:13:02,510 --> 00:13:10,540]  multiple. Okay, and then also our free cash flow remained very sound and healthy. Okay,\n",
            "[00:13:10,540 --> 00:13:19,540]  and then our full year 2021 CAPEX ended up with 12.1 billion. It's about 19% below\n",
            "[00:13:19,540 --> 00:13:27,540]  the guidance of 14.9 billion. We do have about more than 1.5 billion carried over to\n",
            "[00:13:27,540 --> 00:13:33,540]  2022, but we also at the same time we had, you know, more scrutinized our capital spending\n",
            "[00:13:33,540 --> 00:13:42,220]  so that's why we were below 19% below our guidance for 2021. Okay, all right, and then\n",
            "[00:13:42,220 --> 00:13:50,220]  just some quick highlight and overview. So we have seen very solid growth on mobile post-pay\n",
            "[00:13:50,220 --> 00:13:54,220]  customers, even though the market we have been saying it's oversaturated, but then\n",
            "[00:13:54,220 --> 00:14:02,220]  you can see that we still manage to have a 1.4% worldwide revenue increase. And this\n",
            "[00:14:02,220 --> 00:14:11,220]  is really reversing years of a declining trend. So this is really a big deal. And also if\n",
            "[00:14:11,220 --> 00:14:16,220]  you look at the mobile R pool, right, and we were the first in the industry or among\n",
            "[00:14:16,220 --> 00:14:22,250]  our peers to start turning our R pool worldwide positive last year. And then on the right\n",
            "[00:14:22,250 --> 00:14:28,250]  hand side, our post-pay customers continue to grow, even though it's not like a big\n",
            "[00:14:28,250 --> 00:14:34,250]  jump, but then given this is a saturated market, so we still are happy with the growth that\n",
            "[00:14:34,250 --> 00:14:41,250]  we are able to manage. And then the team works really hard and then our network is the best\n",
            "[00:14:41,250 --> 00:14:47,250]  and I think more customers are seeing that. And also on the other hand, our post-pay\n",
            "[00:14:47,250 --> 00:14:54,250]  churn, we continue to manage it down. So in 2021, even though there is the 5G, the new\n",
            "[00:14:54,250 --> 00:15:01,250]  iPhones and all that do, they all start up the churns a little bit, you know, the empty\n",
            "[00:15:01,250 --> 00:15:08,250]  market, but still we manage the churn rate at 1.1. There is still room for improvement\n",
            "[00:15:08,250 --> 00:15:14,790]  of course and we will continue to do that, okay? All right, and then a quick update on\n",
            "[00:15:14,790 --> 00:15:22,790]  the 5G, you know, performance and also our progress. So our 5G penetration has exceeded\n",
            "[00:15:22,790 --> 00:15:28,790]  20% actually since a couple of months ago. So our understanding is ahead of our industry\n",
            "[00:15:28,790 --> 00:15:37,890]  average and our target is to reach 30% by end of the year 2022. And then also more\n",
            "[00:15:37,890 --> 00:15:44,890]  than 80% of these 5G users, they sign up for a high rate plan and then the average\n",
            "[00:15:44,890 --> 00:15:53,690]  monthly fee uplift is more than 20% for renewal customers. And so far we have deployed more\n",
            "[00:15:53,690 --> 00:16:03,690]  than 9,700 stations for 5G and then we have covered island-wide or nationwide more than\n",
            "[00:16:03,690 --> 00:16:11,690]  90%. And then also by end of this year, our target is to cover 97%, okay? And then\n",
            "[00:16:11,690 --> 00:16:18,690]  also we have, you know, with our very strong network team that we have achieved world-class\n",

            "[00:16:32,690 --> 00:16:33,690]  Next slide.\n",
            "[00:16:33,690 --> 00:16:41,690]  And then on the new economy side, so the non-mobile part, the growth engine, right, that continues\n",
            "[00:16:41,690 --> 00:16:47,690]  to be our growth engine. First if you look at the chart on the bottom, so from 2016 that's\n",
            "[00:16:47,690 --> 00:16:52,690]  basically where we started investing in the so-called new business or new economy. At\n",
            "[00:16:52,690 --> 00:16:58,690]  that time it accounts for about 5% of our total revenue and then over time, over the\n",
            "[00:16:59,690 --> 00:17:05,690]  years, right, so it has increased to 17%. And then just look at a YOY, last year even\n",
            "[00:17:05,690 --> 00:17:11,690]  though the pandemic came back to haunt us in Taiwan, but then we still managed to have\n",
            "[00:17:11,690 --> 00:17:19,850]  grown 23.4% in our new business area, so which is very encouraging, okay? And then some highlights\n",
            "[00:17:19,850 --> 00:17:25,850]  in the areas where we did especially well on the enterprise side which accounts for\n",
            "[00:17:25,850 --> 00:17:32,850]  53% of the total new economy revenue. And then the ICT, the smart ICT revenue grew almost\n",
            "[00:17:32,850 --> 00:17:39,850]  30%, YOY. And now cloud service also grew very well into 49%. And then on the consumer\n",
            "[00:17:39,850 --> 00:17:45,850]  side, the media service, the mobile commerce, that's our Friday shopping, you know, both\n",

            "[00:17:52,850 --> 00:18:02,120]  double digits as well. And some highlights for the new economy, so on the consumer, as\n",
            "[00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:11,120]  I mentioned earlier, we launched this mobile circle. It starts as a customer loyalty program\n",

            "[00:18:20,120 --> 00:18:29,120]  grew 72%. So it is encouraging and it also helps boost our e-commerce sales as well.\n",
            "[00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:36,120]  And then Friday video, our monthly active user grew 28%. And then we were also the number\n",

            "[00:18:52,120 --> 00:19:00,120]  during that period, the revenue grew 52.7% compared with a year ago, so which is very\n",

            "[00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:08,120]  And then also the new iPhone launch last year generated excellent bundle sales for not only\n",

            "[00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:54,760]  to 50 villages across 14 countries in 2022.\n",
            "[00:19:54,760 --> 00:20:02,760]  This is just to ‚Äì for your information, this is not just by having the 5G set up.\n",
            "[00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:10,760]  It is also the telecommunication, the communication platform that we have homegrown created for\n",
            "[00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:16,760]  this telemedicine diagnostics over the remote diagnostics.\n",
            "[00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:23,760]  So that whole platform and then plus the 5G connectivity combined, this is the total solution\n",
            "[00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:26,760]  that we provided to all these counties.\n",
            "[00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:33,760]  And we actually won a National Health Quality Award, Healthcare Quality Award for this,\n",
            "[00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:39,760]  which was rare because usually the recipient of that National Healthcare Quality Award\n",
            "[00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:43,760]  are hospitals or research institutions.\n",
            "[00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:50,980]  Okay, and then in Smart City that we continue to do very well because there are projects\n",
            "[00:20:50,980 --> 00:20:55,980]  that are, you know, funded by the local government or funded by the central government.\n",
            "[00:20:55,980 --> 00:21:03,980]  So, for example, we deployed homegrown energy management solutions to 1600 schools in 9 counties.\n",
            "[00:21:03,980 --> 00:21:10,980]  And then, you know, also we started in the smart charging stations business and then\n",
            "[00:21:10,980 --> 00:21:18,980]  also the smart meters and then also the technology, the computer vision for law enforcement.\n",
            "[00:21:19,980 --> 00:21:26,980]  So there are many projects in the Smart City area that we continue to see the demand to grow.\n",
            "[00:21:26,980 --> 00:21:31,080]  And it's a steady growth for us in the IoT area.\n",
            "[00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:39,080]  And then also we in the AI and big data growth in public sector, we start seeing the government\n",
            "[00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:42,080]  also are into so-called transformation.\n",
            "[00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:48,080]  And a lot of that started with their data platform that needed to be established\n",
            "[00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:50,080]  or need to be reengineered.\n",
            "[00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:55,080]  So we got engaged in quite a bit of these type of projects.\n",
            "[00:21:55,080 --> 00:22:02,080]  And also together with our big data analytics and AI machine learning capabilities,\n",
            "[00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:10,370]  we have won quite a few, you know, government contracts and then delivered significant results here.\n",
            "[00:22:10,370 --> 00:22:11,370]  Okay.\n",
            "[00:22:11,370 --> 00:22:12,590]  All right.\n",
            "[00:22:12,590 --> 00:22:17,590]  And then here's just a glance of some of the awards and recognition.\n",
            "[00:22:17,590 --> 00:22:19,590]  Let me see.\n",
            "[00:22:19,590 --> 00:22:25,590]  The fourth on the top from the left, that's the National Healthcare Quality Award I was referring to.\n",
            "[00:22:25,590 --> 00:22:30,590]  And that was for our FET 5G telemedicine solution.\n",
            "[00:22:30,590 --> 00:22:39,590]  And also we have our smart energy management system, EMS, also won the award as well.\n",
            "[00:22:39,590 --> 00:22:46,590]  So these are the areas where we have been kind of spent a lot of time and effort that we encourage\n",
            "[00:22:46,590 --> 00:22:50,590]  our employees to really deep grow these capabilities.\n",
            "[00:22:50,590 --> 00:22:57,590]  And those became instrumental to us providing these homegrown solutions to our ICT business,\n",
            "[00:22:57,590 --> 00:23:02,590]  and which has proven that it has helped increase our profitability\n",
            "[00:23:02,590 --> 00:23:05,590]  and also revenue as well at the same time.\n",
            "[00:23:05,590 --> 00:23:11,590]  And there are some other, you know, recognition from you all, you know, like the Asia\n",
            "[00:23:11,590 --> 00:23:16,590]  and the institutional investor, you know, type of award.\n",
            "[00:23:16,590 --> 00:23:18,590]  Thank you for that.\n",
            "[00:23:18,590 --> 00:23:26,590]  And also we have continued to earn our corporate governance excellence in those areas as well.\n",
            "[00:23:26,590 --> 00:23:31,590]  And then, of course, the first one on the left on the top, that's the DJSI,\n",
            "[00:23:31,590 --> 00:23:37,590]  that we are selected for inclusion in the DJSI World Index for three years in a row.\n",
            "[00:23:37,590 --> 00:23:41,590]  And that is something we will continue to do well and then only to do better.\n",
            "[00:23:41,590 --> 00:23:49,590]  And also FET has always been very customer focused, and so we actually get 10 years in a row,\n",
            "[00:23:49,590 --> 00:23:56,590]  we get the best service, not just for telecom, it's across all service industries.\n",
            "[00:23:56,590 --> 00:23:59,590]  And we got this award 10 years in a row, and this is the tenth\n",
            "[00:23:59,590 --> 00:24:04,590]  and then the only one company that gets this special award.\n",
            "[00:24:04,590 --> 00:24:05,620]  Okay.\n",
            "[00:24:05,620 --> 00:24:06,910]  All right.\n",
            "[00:24:06,910 --> 00:24:16,910]  So for 2022 priorities, and then as I have advocated with my team, we ought to scale up to grow.\n",
            "[00:24:16,910 --> 00:24:22,910]  We do see a lot of growth opportunities, and this is before we even, you know, think about the merger.\n",
            "[00:24:22,910 --> 00:24:27,910]  So we already see the growth opportunity, so we need to scale up to grow.\n",
            "[00:24:27,910 --> 00:24:32,910]  You know, in the past, especially like when we support the enterprise solutions,\n",
            "[00:24:32,910 --> 00:24:36,910]  we have some dedicated resources, we have some shared resources.\n",
            "[00:24:36,910 --> 00:24:43,910]  But then seeing the momentum, the growth momentum in the smart ICT, the homegrown solutions area,\n",
            "[00:24:43,910 --> 00:24:48,910]  so we have done some restructuring, we have put together a dedicated team\n",
            "[00:24:48,910 --> 00:24:51,910]  to just support the enterprise business unit.\n",
            "[00:24:51,910 --> 00:24:57,910]  And then also we have the FET mobile circle.\n",
            "[00:24:57,910 --> 00:25:02,910]  We'll continue to grow that, and it is the engagement program with our customers.\n",
            "[00:25:02,910 --> 00:25:10,910]  And then by engaging with our customers deeply, and we do expect that we can see the users needs more,\n",
            "[00:25:10,910 --> 00:25:17,910]  and then they can consume more in this mobile circle through various services that we provided for them.\n",
            "[00:25:17,910 --> 00:25:22,910]  Either it's homegrown or it is co-created with other companies,\n",
            "[00:25:22,910 --> 00:25:28,540]  and even with some startup companies that they have good, okay.\n",
            "[00:25:28,540 --> 00:25:34,540]  And of course with 5G being a revenue uplifter, right, for us.\n",
            "[00:25:34,540 --> 00:25:39,540]  So we'll continue to grow and accelerate our 5G conversion,\n",
            "[00:25:39,540 --> 00:25:43,540]  and then we will grow our telecom business accordingly.\n",
            "[00:25:43,540 --> 00:25:47,540]  And customer experience, how to optimize it.\n",
            "[00:25:47,540 --> 00:25:50,540]  And as I mentioned previously for the merger,\n",
            "[00:25:50,540 --> 00:25:54,540]  even if it doesn't happen this year and then the year after,\n",
            "[00:25:54,540 --> 00:26:01,540]  but then improve customer experience with this additional asset that we will acquire from APT.\n",
            "[00:26:01,540 --> 00:26:06,540]  It will make our network even more robust,\n",
            "[00:26:06,540 --> 00:26:10,540]  and then the kind of service that we will be able to provide,\n",
            "[00:26:10,540 --> 00:26:16,960]  and also with the largest 5G spectrum that per user will be able to enjoy.\n",
            "[00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:22,960]  As there will be more 5G, new 5G services that will be available,\n",
            "[00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:28,960]  and then our users, far eastern users, will have the biggest bandwidth to enjoy them all.\n",
            "[00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:30,960]  Okay, alright.\n",
            "[00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:36,180]  So for the 2022, our consolidated financial forecast,\n",
            "[00:26:36,180 --> 00:26:41,180]  we are looking at EPS will be 2.83 for this year.\n",
            "[00:26:41,180 --> 00:26:47,180]  And then by the way, this guidance that we are providing here\n",
            "[00:26:47,180 --> 00:26:51,180]  does not take this merger into account.\n",
            "[00:26:51,180 --> 00:26:55,180]  So this is not considering the merger, okay.\n",
            "[00:26:55,180 --> 00:27:01,180]  And also, if you compare to our 2021 result, from an EPS perspective,\n",
            "[00:27:01,180 --> 00:27:05,180]  it looks like it's only 1.1%, almost like a flat.\n",
            "[00:27:05,180 --> 00:27:10,180]  But then now I do need to mention that sales of the one building again.\n",
            "[00:27:10,180 --> 00:27:13,180]  So that one timer, if you exclude that one timer,\n",
            "[00:27:13,180 --> 00:27:20,180]  we are really talking about 17% year-over-year growth for our net income and our EPS.\n",
            "[00:27:20,180 --> 00:27:24,180]  Okay, that is just for your information and some clarification.\n",
            "[00:27:24,180 --> 00:27:32,180]  In terms of our CapEx, this year we are really looking at the new capital spending is 9.6,\n",
            "[00:27:32,180 --> 00:27:39,180]  and then plus 1.5 billion that will be carried over from 2021.\n",
            "[00:27:39,180 --> 00:27:43,180]  So the total is about 11.1 billion.\n",
            "[00:27:43,180 --> 00:27:46,600]  Of course, with the merger plan on the table,\n",
            "[00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:50,600]  we will also look at if there is more optimization we can do\n",
            "[00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:53,600]  anticipating the merger to be approved,\n",
            "[00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:59,600]  and then what kind of optimization we can do in terms of our capital spending.\n",
            "[00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:04,600]  But then this one right now is before we consider any merger in it.\n",
            "[00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:06,950]  Okay, alright.\n",
            "[00:28:06,950 --> 00:28:11,950]  Okay, and then now last but not least about our dividend proposal.\n",
            "[00:28:11,950 --> 00:28:17,950]  So we still want to maintain a very stable dividend policy.\n",
            "[00:28:17,950 --> 00:28:24,950]  And so for this year, 2021, that our proposal is still to provide 3.25 per share,\n",
            "[00:28:24,950 --> 00:28:26,950]  dividend per share.\n",
            "[00:28:26,950 --> 00:28:36,240]  Of course, all this is subject to our assembly of our general board approval.\n",
            "[00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:39,240]  Our shareholders meeting approval.\n",
            "[00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:41,240]  That will be held in June.\n",
            "[00:28:41,240 --> 00:28:43,340]  Okay, alright.\n",
            "[00:28:43,340 --> 00:28:45,340]  Is that the last slide?\n",
            "[00:28:45,340 --> 00:28:49,340]  Okay, so that is all the presentation we have prepared for you.\n",
            "[00:28:49,340 --> 00:28:52,340]  And I now welcome your questions.\n",
            "[00:28:52,340 --> 00:28:54,650]  Thank you, President Xi.\n",
            "[00:28:54,650 --> 00:28:58,650]  Ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin our question and answer session.\n",
            "[00:28:58,650 --> 00:29:01,650]  If you have a question for any of today's speakers,\n",
            "[00:29:01,650 --> 00:29:06,650]  please press 01 on your telephone keypad and you will enter the queue.\n",
            "[00:29:06,650 --> 00:29:09,650]  After you are announced, please ask your question.\n",
            "[00:29:09,650 --> 00:29:13,650]  If you find that your question has been answered before it is your turn to speak,\n",
            "[00:29:13,650 --> 00:29:16,650]  please press 02 to cancel the question.\n",
            "[00:29:16,650 --> 00:29:17,650]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:29:17,650 --> 00:29:20,650]  Now please press 01 to ask the question.\n",
            "[00:29:20,650 --> 00:29:23,280]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:29:23,280 --> 00:29:27,280]  And our first question is coming from Neil Anderson of HSBC.\n",
            "[00:29:27,280 --> 00:29:28,280]  Go ahead, please.\n",
            "[00:29:28,280 --> 00:29:30,460]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:29:30,460 --> 00:29:31,460]  Good afternoon.\n",
            "[00:29:31,460 --> 00:29:32,460]  Congratulations on the merger.\n",
            "[00:29:32,460 --> 00:29:33,460]  That's very good news.\n",
            "[00:29:33,460 --> 00:29:34,460]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:29:34,460 --> 00:29:36,460]  Two questions, please.\n",
            "[00:29:36,460 --> 00:29:40,460]  The first relates to the 3 billion of synergies.\n",
            "[00:29:40,460 --> 00:29:43,460]  You mentioned that it was quite conservative.\n",
            "[00:29:43,460 --> 00:29:47,460]  So would it be possible to give a bit more guidance on that?\n",
            "[00:29:47,460 --> 00:29:50,460]  Does it mainly relate to network costs?\n",
            "[00:29:50,460 --> 00:29:52,460]  I guess that would be the largest part.\n",
            "[00:29:52,460 --> 00:29:54,460]  I'm just wondering if in that,\n",
            "[00:29:54,460 --> 00:29:59,460]  there are too many revenue-related synergies in that 3 billion figure.\n",
            "[00:29:59,460 --> 00:30:00,460]  That's the first one.\n",
            "[00:30:00,460 --> 00:30:03,460]  And the second one relates to the millimeter wave where,\n",
            "[00:30:03,460 --> 00:30:07,460]  as you point out, you have a very strong position.\n",
            "[00:30:07,460 --> 00:30:13,560]  But the adoption of that spectrum has been quite limited so far.\n",
            "[00:30:13,560 --> 00:30:16,560]  I think the U.S., maybe Australia, a little bit Japan,\n",
            "[00:30:16,560 --> 00:30:18,560]  but in other markets, not so much.\n",
            "[00:30:18,560 --> 00:30:23,560]  So I'm intrigued by your mention of using that with low-Earth orbit satellites\n",
            "[00:30:23,560 --> 00:30:25,560]  and also private networks.\n",
            "[00:30:25,560 --> 00:30:28,560]  So are you able to give any more details on that, please,\n",
            "[00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:30,560]  both the demand for the private network\n",
            "[00:30:30,560 --> 00:30:36,560]  and what exactly is the plan with the low-Earth orbit satellite?\n",
            "[00:30:36,560 --> 00:30:38,680]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:30:38,680 --> 00:30:39,680]  Okay.\n",
            "[00:30:39,680 --> 00:30:40,680]  Thank you, Neil.\n",
            "[00:30:40,680 --> 00:30:42,680]  So the first question is about the synergy,\n",
            "[00:30:42,680 --> 00:30:45,680]  where I made a statement that we are quite conservative\n",
            "[00:30:45,680 --> 00:30:49,680]  when I mentioned the 3 billion first year, right?\n",
            "[00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:50,680]  Okay.\n",
            "[00:30:50,680 --> 00:30:53,680]  So instead of giving a more aggressive number,\n",
            "[00:30:53,680 --> 00:30:55,680]  I think I'll just explain my rationale.\n",
            "[00:30:55,680 --> 00:30:57,680]  So you can look at 3 billion.\n",
            "[00:30:57,680 --> 00:31:01,680]  I look at mostly from the cost-saving side, right?\n",
            "[00:31:01,680 --> 00:31:06,680]  So even if I assume a flat revenue,\n",
            "[00:31:06,680 --> 00:31:13,680]  and then that would be that I'm comfortable with the 3 billion kind of synergy\n",
            "[00:31:13,680 --> 00:31:15,680]  contribution the first year.\n",
            "[00:31:15,680 --> 00:31:22,680]  So if anything we do more than that on the upside, that will be just a bonus.\n",
            "[00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:27,680]  So that's why I said it's a conservative estimate.\n",
            "[00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:29,160]  Okay.\n",
            "[00:31:29,160 --> 00:31:33,160]  And then for the second question regarding the 28G.\n",
            "[00:31:33,160 --> 00:31:34,160]  So you're right.\n",
            "[00:31:34,160 --> 00:31:36,160]  And then so even for Far Eastern,\n",
            "[00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:41,160]  the private network that we have engaged in so far,\n",
            "[00:31:41,160 --> 00:31:45,160]  we just use the 3.5G network that we have.\n",
            "[00:31:45,160 --> 00:31:47,160]  Well, first because it's already there,\n",
            "[00:31:47,160 --> 00:31:51,160]  and then also the adoption of the users,\n",
            "[00:31:51,160 --> 00:31:53,160]  the penetration is still only 20%.\n",
            "[00:31:53,160 --> 00:31:56,160]  So there's plenty of capacity and all that.\n",
            "[00:31:56,160 --> 00:32:05,160]  And then that is also the fastest way to just reuse the existing macro network\n",
            "[00:32:05,160 --> 00:32:08,160]  to support the private network.\n",
            "[00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:13,160]  Then as we can see, some of the factories and all that,\n",
            "[00:32:13,160 --> 00:32:19,160]  using a 28G as a dedicated private network,\n",
            "[00:32:19,160 --> 00:32:21,160]  those scenarios can also work.\n",
            "[00:32:21,160 --> 00:32:25,160]  And actually APT already has some deployment.\n",
            "[00:32:25,160 --> 00:32:28,160]  So that's why I said once we already, you know,\n",
            "[00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:30,160]  because APT already started that.\n",
            "[00:32:30,160 --> 00:32:35,160]  This is just a matter of when we want to start engaging that area.\n",
            "[00:32:35,160 --> 00:32:40,160]  So that definitely is one additional asset that we can put our private\n",
            "[00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:41,160]  networks with.\n",
            "[00:32:41,160 --> 00:32:43,160]  And then in terms of the LEO,\n",
            "[00:32:44,160 --> 00:32:48,160]  it is really referring to some of the, I think that's a,\n",
            "[00:32:48,160 --> 00:32:50,160]  what's it called, Starlink?\n",
            "[00:32:50,160 --> 00:32:51,640]  Starlink.\n",
            "[00:32:51,640 --> 00:32:54,640]  Starlink, yeah, and also another satellite company.\n",
            "[00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:58,640]  So they were already contacting our government, right,\n",
            "[00:32:58,640 --> 00:33:02,640]  regarding, you know, if they would, how they could operate or how,\n",
            "[00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:08,640]  you know, so if you compare the spectrum that they need to operate within,\n",
            "[00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:13,640]  and then it is actually kind of coincide with our 28, you know,\n",
            "[00:33:13,640 --> 00:33:16,640]  28G area, and in particular, you know,\n",
            "[00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:22,640]  kind of overlap with what APT and FET both have.\n",
            "[00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:24,640]  So that is one area.\n",
            "[00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:31,990]  So for some of, for those foreign satellite operators to work and to\n",
            "[00:33:31,990 --> 00:33:35,990]  cooperate or to try to operate in Taiwan,\n",
            "[00:33:35,990 --> 00:33:38,990]  then that is one area that they will need to talk to us first.\n",
            "[00:33:38,990 --> 00:33:42,990]  So that's what I was referring to as a future opportunity.\n",
            "[00:33:42,990 --> 00:33:44,990]  So there we may be able to, you know,\n",
            "[00:33:44,990 --> 00:33:50,990]  just join venture or have some kind of collaboration or profit sharing.\n",
            "[00:33:50,990 --> 00:33:53,500]  Got it.\n",
            "[00:33:53,500 --> 00:33:54,500]  Thank you very much.\n",
            "[00:33:54,500 --> 00:33:55,590]  Does that help?\n",
            "[00:33:55,590 --> 00:33:56,590]  Yeah, it does.\n",
            "[00:33:56,590 --> 00:33:58,590]  And just to follow up on the network savings,\n",
            "[00:33:58,590 --> 00:34:01,590]  the timing of those synergies,\n",
            "[00:34:01,590 --> 00:34:04,590]  I'm assuming that because you're both using the same vendor,\n",
            "[00:34:04,590 --> 00:34:07,590]  and as you say, the spectrum is mostly contiguous,\n",
            "[00:34:07,590 --> 00:34:09,590]  you can, as soon as you get approval,\n",
            "[00:34:09,590 --> 00:34:14,590]  you can start to realize those cost synergies almost immediately.\n",
            "[00:34:14,590 --> 00:34:15,590]  Is that right?\n",
            "[00:34:15,590 --> 00:34:16,690]  Correct.\n",
            "[00:34:16,690 --> 00:34:17,690]  That is correct.\n",
            "[00:34:17,690 --> 00:34:18,690]  Yes.\n",
            "[00:34:18,690 --> 00:34:21,690]  And also, as I mentioned in the last bullet,\n",
            "[00:34:21,690 --> 00:34:26,690]  I think 92% of their cell sites could be consolidated with us.\n",
            "[00:34:26,690 --> 00:34:30,690]  This is like without me making any network, you know, changes,\n",
            "[00:34:31,690 --> 00:34:34,690]  then we can already just help them consolidate those.\n",
            "[00:34:34,690 --> 00:34:37,690]  And then so with the incremental cost, right,\n",
            "[00:34:37,690 --> 00:34:41,690]  so they do not have that whole site maintenance and the utilities\n",
            "[00:34:41,690 --> 00:34:45,690]  and all that that they pay at a full price.\n",
            "[00:34:45,690 --> 00:34:48,690]  So by just consolidating that 90%,\n",
            "[00:34:48,690 --> 00:34:50,690]  and then as soon as we get approval,\n",
            "[00:34:50,690 --> 00:34:53,690]  that is something we can already start with.\n",
            "[00:34:53,690 --> 00:34:59,690]  And then each cell site that we will be able to eliminate\n",
            "[00:34:59,690 --> 00:35:02,690]  or, you know, and then that is a one-size-saving.\n",
            "[00:35:02,690 --> 00:35:04,690]  So we have a look at that.\n",
            "[00:35:04,690 --> 00:35:07,690]  And then, you know, like within half a year,\n",
            "[00:35:07,690 --> 00:35:13,850]  80% of the savings will be already achieved from this one item in particular.\n",
            "[00:35:13,850 --> 00:35:15,850]  So it's an ongoing process,\n",
            "[00:35:15,850 --> 00:35:20,850]  and then so it's not like you wait for a bulk to realize the savings.\n",
            "[00:35:20,850 --> 00:35:24,850]  It's each site that we will be able to close down for them,\n",
            "[00:35:24,850 --> 00:35:29,160]  and that is one size of savings.\n",
            "[00:35:29,160 --> 00:35:31,160]  That's great. Thank you very much.\n",
            "[00:35:31,160 --> 00:35:32,160]  Okay.\n",
            "[00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:37,240]  Next question, Danny Chu of Bank of America.\n",
            "[00:35:37,240 --> 00:35:40,300]  Go ahead, please.\n",
            "[00:35:40,300 --> 00:35:42,300]  Thank you for the presentation.\n",
            "[00:35:42,300 --> 00:35:44,300]  Just two quick questions.\n",
            "[00:35:44,300 --> 00:35:47,300]  The first one actually is also on the cost savings.\n",
            "[00:35:47,300 --> 00:35:53,300]  Since you mentioned that of the $3 billion EBITDA synergy,\n",
            "[00:35:53,300 --> 00:35:58,300]  so now we should assume it mostly comes from the op-ed savings side.\n",
            "[00:35:58,300 --> 00:36:02,300]  But if we look beyond the first year,\n",
            "[00:36:02,300 --> 00:36:05,300]  should we expect just on the cost savings side,\n",
            "[00:36:05,300 --> 00:36:09,300]  the savings would be more than $3 billion or less than $3 billion,\n",
            "[00:36:09,300 --> 00:36:12,300]  kind of like if we look one year further.\n",
            "[00:36:12,300 --> 00:36:16,300]  And my second question actually is related to the capex.\n",
            "[00:36:16,300 --> 00:36:23,300]  Danny, you mentioned that we have some capex savings for FY21.\n",
            "[00:36:23,300 --> 00:36:25,300]  Could you elaborate a little bit more?\n",
            "[00:36:25,300 --> 00:36:28,300]  Is it because of the drop in the equipment pricing\n",
            "[00:36:28,300 --> 00:36:32,300]  or after our initial planning,\n",
            "[00:36:32,300 --> 00:36:36,300]  we decided that we don't need to roll out as many base stations\n",
            "[00:36:36,300 --> 00:36:38,300]  as we initially thought?\n",
            "[00:36:38,300 --> 00:36:42,300]  And also, going forward, related to capexes,\n",
            "[00:36:42,300 --> 00:36:44,300]  as soon as the merger gets approved,\n",
            "[00:36:44,300 --> 00:36:49,300]  what kind of capex savings should we expect in terms of magnitude?\n",
            "[00:36:49,300 --> 00:36:50,300]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:36:50,300 --> 00:36:53,380]  Okay.\n",
            "[00:36:54,380 --> 00:36:56,380]  So for the first one, yeah,\n",
            "[00:36:56,380 --> 00:37:01,380]  a big part of the savings I was looking at is from the op-ed side, right?\n",
            "[00:37:01,380 --> 00:37:05,380]  And then those are like annual,\n",
            "[00:37:05,380 --> 00:37:07,380]  so you can kind of look at them as recurring.\n",
            "[00:37:07,380 --> 00:37:10,380]  So the savings will be recurring as well.\n",
            "[00:37:10,380 --> 00:37:15,380]  In terms of the capex savings, just to give one example, right,\n",
            "[00:37:15,380 --> 00:37:19,380]  like for 700 megahertz spectrum,\n",
            "[00:37:19,380 --> 00:37:26,380]  AT&T has previously, because they are sharing with our 3.5G spectrum,\n",
            "[00:37:26,380 --> 00:37:31,380]  and then the NCC has kind of requested them to do more investment\n",
            "[00:37:31,380 --> 00:37:34,380]  to improve their 4G network.\n",
            "[00:37:34,380 --> 00:37:41,380]  So they have since acquired, you know, new 4G RAN stations,\n",
            "[00:37:41,380 --> 00:37:43,380]  RAN equipment from Ericsson,\n",
            "[00:37:43,380 --> 00:37:46,380]  and those are the newer models and all that.\n",
            "[00:37:46,380 --> 00:37:48,380]  For ESO, on the other hand,\n",
            "[00:37:48,380 --> 00:37:54,380]  we are also in the process of modernizing our 700 equipment.\n",
            "[00:37:54,380 --> 00:37:55,380]  So for that, you know,\n",
            "[00:37:55,380 --> 00:37:59,380]  given they already have quite a few thousand of them,\n",
            "[00:37:59,380 --> 00:38:02,380]  4,000 such network equipment,\n",
            "[00:38:02,380 --> 00:38:05,380]  and that means I do not need to buy another 4,000,\n",
            "[00:38:05,380 --> 00:38:08,380]  and those can be just reused once we combine.\n",
            "[00:38:08,380 --> 00:38:13,380]  So that gives you some idea about the kind of savings we are talking about.\n",
            "[00:38:13,380 --> 00:38:17,840]  Did I help, Danny?\n",
            "[00:38:19,190 --> 00:38:23,610]  Yeah, but does that apply to the FY21 situation\n",
            "[00:38:23,610 --> 00:38:25,610]  when you mentioned initially the budget,\n",
            "[00:38:25,610 --> 00:38:29,610]  about, like, I mean, 12 point something billion.\n",
            "[00:38:29,610 --> 00:38:30,610]  Oh.\n",
            "[00:38:30,610 --> 00:38:35,610]  But in the end, you only spend about, like, 9 point something billion.\n",
            "[00:38:35,610 --> 00:38:36,900]  Yes, yes.\n",
            "[00:38:36,900 --> 00:38:41,900]  Okay, so what I actually asked my team, the network team, to do,\n",
            "[00:38:41,900 --> 00:38:43,900]  like today I told them, I said,\n",
            "[00:38:43,900 --> 00:38:47,900]  okay, I know you have given me this network plan, right, for this year,\n",
            "[00:38:47,900 --> 00:38:51,900]  and based on that, we approved, you know, a total CapEx,\n",
            "[00:38:51,900 --> 00:38:54,900]  but then a big part of it, of course, is network.\n",
            "[00:38:54,900 --> 00:38:57,900]  Network is my money burner.\n",
            "[00:38:57,900 --> 00:39:00,900]  So I told them that is based on, you know,\n",
            "[00:39:00,900 --> 00:39:04,900]  without anybody knowing that we will do the merger.\n",
            "[00:39:04,900 --> 00:39:06,900]  I said, so now given the merger, right,\n",
            "[00:39:06,900 --> 00:39:09,900]  you need to kind of do some optimization.\n",
            "[00:39:09,900 --> 00:39:14,900]  Some of the equipment or some of the investment in some of the areas\n",
            "[00:39:14,900 --> 00:39:16,900]  that you were thinking to do,\n",
            "[00:39:16,900 --> 00:39:21,900]  now anticipating the merger if that will be granted in, you know,\n",
            "[00:39:21,900 --> 00:39:23,900]  nine months or so kind of time frame.\n",
            "[00:39:23,900 --> 00:39:26,900]  Can this be something deferred?\n",
            "[00:39:26,900 --> 00:39:29,900]  And then if we can merge, then there's no need for it.\n",
            "[00:39:29,900 --> 00:39:34,900]  And if we don't merge, that can be done, that could be picked up then.\n",
            "[00:39:34,900 --> 00:39:39,900]  So this is the kind of optimization that my team is going to do.\n",
            "[00:39:39,900 --> 00:39:41,900]  They already got the order from me.\n",
            "[00:39:41,900 --> 00:39:45,900]  So that's the kind of, that's why I was saying I would expect some\n",
            "[00:39:45,900 --> 00:39:50,900]  of this request that they have submitted for the capital spending\n",
            "[00:39:50,900 --> 00:39:53,900]  will be scrubbed and then reprioritized.\n",
            "[00:39:53,900 --> 00:39:55,900]  And then some of them could be deferred,\n",
            "[00:39:55,900 --> 00:40:00,900]  and then that will not spend this year.\n",
            "[00:40:00,900 --> 00:40:03,210]  I see.\n",
            "[00:40:03,210 --> 00:40:04,300]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:40:04,300 --> 00:40:05,300]  Okay.\n",
            "[00:40:05,300 --> 00:40:08,700]  Sure.\n",
            "[00:40:08,700 --> 00:40:12,700]  If you would like to ask a question, please press 01 on your telephone keypad.\n",
            "[00:40:12,700 --> 00:40:13,700]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:40:13,700 --> 00:40:18,060]  And next we'll have 01 of UBS for questions.\n",
            "[00:40:18,060 --> 00:40:19,980]  Go ahead, please.\n",
            "[00:40:19,980 --> 00:40:23,980]  Thank you for the opportunity to ask a question, and congrats on the results.\n",
            "[00:40:23,980 --> 00:40:25,980]  So I have two questions.\n",
            "[00:40:25,980 --> 00:40:29,980]  First is regarding the new economy revenue.\n",
            "[00:40:29,980 --> 00:40:32,980]  So the revenue growth here is quite solid.\n",
            "[00:40:32,980 --> 00:40:39,980]  So may I ask what's the margin profile here, either gross margin or EBITDA margin?\n",
            "[00:40:39,980 --> 00:40:44,980]  And the second question is that for the 2022 guidance,\n",
            "[00:40:44,980 --> 00:40:48,980]  I understand that does not take the merger into account.\n",
            "[00:40:48,980 --> 00:40:52,980]  So it seems we target EBITDA to grow by 8%.\n",
            "[00:40:52,980 --> 00:40:55,980]  May I ask what's the key drivers here?\n",
            "[00:40:55,980 --> 00:41:00,140]  And maybe into more into the mid to long term,\n",
            "[00:41:00,140 --> 00:41:06,140]  given our mobile market has consolidated and mobile churn remain low.\n",
            "[00:41:06,140 --> 00:41:12,140]  So what do you think or is there anything changed in your views that\n",
            "[00:41:12,140 --> 00:41:17,140]  in terms of telecom's competitive advantage?\n",
            "[00:41:17,140 --> 00:41:22,140]  So, for example, is there any new area that Bison will focus more on?\n",
            "[00:41:22,140 --> 00:41:27,220]  And then how is Bison positioned?\n",
            "[00:41:27,220 --> 00:41:31,220]  Okay, Sarah, let me just make sure I capture your question.\n",
            "[00:41:31,220 --> 00:41:35,220]  So the first one is about new economy, right?\n",
            "[00:41:35,220 --> 00:41:43,640]  And then our overall new economy growth margin remains about above 30%, okay?\n",
            "[00:41:43,640 --> 00:41:54,620]  And then for the digital services gross margin, that is close to 50% in 2021, yeah.\n",
            "[00:41:54,620 --> 00:41:57,620]  And ICT is around 15%.\n",
            "[00:41:57,620 --> 00:42:02,780]  And that is something with our homegrown solutions,\n",
            "[00:42:02,780 --> 00:42:04,780]  and we anticipate this will continue to grow.\n",
            "[00:42:04,780 --> 00:42:10,350]  That is also something to set KPI for that as well.\n",
            "[00:42:10,350 --> 00:42:13,250]  Okay, that's your first question.\n",
            "[00:42:13,250 --> 00:42:26,170]  And your second question is about the EBITDA growth driver after the merger or before?\n",
            "[00:42:26,170 --> 00:42:30,200]  Before, just based on the 2022 guidance.\n",
            "[00:42:30,200 --> 00:42:36,200]  Okay, well, actually I see, you know, for the telecom, you know,\n",
            "[00:42:36,200 --> 00:42:39,200]  we already reversed the trend of declining.\n",
            "[00:42:39,200 --> 00:42:44,200]  And then, you know, telecom is kind of accounts for almost 80%, right,\n",
            "[00:42:44,200 --> 00:42:50,200]  combined the device and also the service revenue.\n",
            "[00:42:50,200 --> 00:42:58,200]  So this is, you know, for every percent that we will be able to grow,\n",
            "[00:42:58,200 --> 00:43:02,200]  and that's a big base to grow from.\n",
            "[00:43:02,200 --> 00:43:07,200]  So the telecom definitely, that's why I have this thing with my team,\n",
            "[00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:11,200]  is we have to refocus to grow our telecom business,\n",
            "[00:43:11,200 --> 00:43:16,200]  especially because of 5G and because we build a robust 5G network, right?\n",
            "[00:43:16,200 --> 00:43:21,200]  And then we really have done very well,\n",
            "[00:43:21,200 --> 00:43:25,200]  and then we have achieved world-class, you know, network performance.\n",
            "[00:43:25,200 --> 00:43:29,200]  And then that is very important from the telecom, you know, perspective.\n",
            "[00:43:29,200 --> 00:43:35,200]  So we will continue to grow telecom, which is different than the past few years\n",
            "[00:43:35,200 --> 00:43:37,200]  because telecom has been kind of declining.\n",
            "[00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:40,200]  And then while we focus on new economy, but as you know,\n",
            "[00:43:40,200 --> 00:43:42,200]  the weight is different.\n",
            "[00:43:42,200 --> 00:43:47,200]  But then now what we are seeing is in addition to we see the demand,\n",
            "[00:43:47,200 --> 00:43:50,200]  you know, the growth momentum on the new economy,\n",
            "[00:43:50,200 --> 00:43:55,200]  but then even better we see the momentum on the telecom as well.\n",
            "[00:43:55,200 --> 00:44:00,200]  So in terms of even a driver, I would say it's both the telecom\n",
            "[00:44:00,200 --> 00:44:02,200]  and also the new economy.\n",
            "[00:44:02,200 --> 00:44:05,200]  And then within the new economy, you know,\n",
            "[00:44:06,200 --> 00:44:11,200]  we did especially well with our enterprise side, right, last year.\n",
            "[00:44:11,200 --> 00:44:15,200]  And so I do expect to see that to continue.\n",
            "[00:44:15,200 --> 00:44:19,200]  And on the other hand, you know, just some side notes.\n",
            "[00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:25,200]  So I have restructured our consumer BU to two divisions.\n",
            "[00:44:25,200 --> 00:44:28,200]  So I separated the consumer BU, the telecom,\n",
            "[00:44:28,200 --> 00:44:31,200]  from the consumer BU digital services.\n",
            "[00:44:31,200 --> 00:44:37,200]  And then also with the two senior VPs, I put, you know, one for each\n",
            "[00:44:37,200 --> 00:44:42,200]  so that we have focused attention by the executive leader to grow\n",
            "[00:44:42,200 --> 00:44:46,200]  and to drive, you know, the telecom as well as the digital services\n",
            "[00:44:46,200 --> 00:44:48,200]  on the consumer side.\n",
            "[00:44:48,200 --> 00:44:53,200]  So I do expect that if you ask the drivers, it's the telecom business,\n",
            "[00:44:53,200 --> 00:45:02,370]  it's the new digital services, and also it's the enterprise, the smart ICT.\n",
            "[00:45:02,370 --> 00:45:03,370]  Okay.\n",
            "[00:45:03,370 --> 00:45:06,370]  Sarah, you probably have another question.\n",
            "[00:45:06,370 --> 00:45:09,850]  Would you repeat it for me or did I answer it all?\n",
            "[00:45:09,850 --> 00:45:12,850]  Yeah, let me rephrase my other question.\n",
            "[00:45:12,850 --> 00:45:16,850]  So, yeah, for the enterprise segment,\n",
            "[00:45:16,850 --> 00:45:21,850]  so we actually see that Verizon gained a lot of projects.\n",
            "[00:45:21,850 --> 00:45:27,330]  So what do you think is the key reason here given, well,\n",
            "[00:45:27,330 --> 00:45:29,330]  the market has another incumbent?\n",
            "[00:45:29,330 --> 00:45:33,330]  So what's the key reason that Verizon can keep winning projects\n",
            "[00:45:33,330 --> 00:45:39,190]  on the enterprise side, especially from the public sector?\n",
            "[00:45:39,190 --> 00:45:40,190]  Well, thank you.\n",
            "[00:45:40,190 --> 00:45:46,190]  I think you're helping me with a little bit kind of like my soapbox\n",
            "[00:45:46,190 --> 00:45:49,190]  kind of story here.\n",
            "[00:45:49,190 --> 00:45:55,190]  So I think the efforts that we have put in in this big data and then,\n",
            "[00:45:55,190 --> 00:46:01,190]  you know, AI and then IoT areas, you know, and also cloud, right,\n",
            "[00:46:01,190 --> 00:46:03,190]  and they didn't get unnoticed.\n",
            "[00:46:03,190 --> 00:46:09,180]  Build our reputation over the years with our homegrown solutions\n",
            "[00:46:09,180 --> 00:46:11,180]  and with our team's agility\n",
            "[00:46:11,180 --> 00:46:14,180]  and flexibility in meeting the customer needs.\n",
            "[00:46:14,180 --> 00:46:22,600]  And that is why even another incumbent vendor by a lot of these,\n",
            "[00:46:23,600 --> 00:46:26,600]  by all of these, you know, government agencies,\n",
            "[00:46:26,600 --> 00:46:30,600]  but then we were able to really break through that barrier.\n",
            "[00:46:30,600 --> 00:46:33,600]  And then, you know, the reputation just goes around.\n",
            "[00:46:33,600 --> 00:46:38,600]  So we have been getting good projects and winning good projects.\n",
            "[00:46:38,600 --> 00:46:41,600]  Just like, for example, the telemedicine, right,\n",
            "[00:46:41,600 --> 00:46:47,600]  and the Ministry of Welfare and then Health,\n",
            "[00:46:47,600 --> 00:46:51,600]  they actually, you know, do look upon our team to, you know,\n",
            "[00:46:51,600 --> 00:46:57,600]  help them kind of provide some of these specs, information and all that\n",
            "[00:46:57,600 --> 00:47:00,600]  because we have worked really, really long time\n",
            "[00:47:00,600 --> 00:47:05,600]  and then spend a lot of time understanding the telemedicine areas need.\n",
            "[00:47:05,600 --> 00:47:12,600]  So they would talk with us about these related issues and for our input.\n",
            "[00:47:12,600 --> 00:47:18,600]  So I think, so I'm glad to report I do see that our efforts didn't go wasted\n",
            "[00:47:18,600 --> 00:47:20,600]  and that actually it is paying off.\n",
            "[00:47:20,600 --> 00:47:21,600]  It is paying off.\n",
            "[00:47:21,600 --> 00:47:24,600]  And I'm glad, you know, they do get recognized.\n",
            "[00:47:24,600 --> 00:47:29,600]  And as I tell my team, every project we finish, we leave reputation behind us, right?\n",
            "[00:47:29,600 --> 00:47:32,600]  And whether that's good or bad, and that's what we need to work on.\n",
            "[00:47:32,600 --> 00:47:36,600]  And exactly, that's why we need to have the customer-centric view\n",
            "[00:47:36,600 --> 00:47:42,600]  and we need to, you know, do everything to make sure our quality is good and all that.\n",
            "[00:47:42,600 --> 00:47:47,600]  So we just have to be consistent and then we have to do it, you know, consistently\n",
            "[00:47:47,600 --> 00:47:52,490]  and then, you know, raise our bar.\n",
            "[00:47:52,490 --> 00:47:53,490]  Got it.\n",
            "[00:47:53,490 --> 00:47:55,490]  And just one last question from me.\n",
            "[00:47:55,490 --> 00:48:05,020]  So the 2022 guidance, do we have any target for the new economy revenue contribution?\n",
            "[00:48:05,020 --> 00:48:10,020]  So we expect it to still have double-digit growth.\n",
            "[00:48:10,020 --> 00:48:15,020]  Now in terms of what do we set a target for what's the ‚Äì\n",
            "[00:48:15,020 --> 00:48:22,020]  As you see, like, okay, so we are looking at about close to 19%, 19%,\n",
            "[00:48:22,020 --> 00:48:28,020]  in terms of, you know, accounts for our total, 19% of our total revenue.\n",
            "[00:48:28,020 --> 00:48:31,020]  But of course, you know, this is a relative thing.\n",
            "[00:48:31,020 --> 00:48:35,020]  So I like my, you know, total revenue is like exceeded my target.\n",
            "[00:48:35,020 --> 00:48:39,620]  So even if this is a little bit small, I'm okay with that.\n",
            "[00:48:39,620 --> 00:48:46,620]  But then if we use our current forecast and it's about 18.9%.\n",
            "[00:48:46,620 --> 00:48:54,640]  So we will grow from last year's 17.2% to 18.9%.\n",
            "[00:48:54,640 --> 00:48:55,640]  Got it, very clear.\n",
            "[00:48:55,640 --> 00:48:56,740]  Thank you.\n",

            "[00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:53,120]  and CFO Sharon both joined the call with us today. Before Xi's brief presentation,\n",

            "[00:01:07,220 --> 00:01:14,020]  half and the second quarter in particular, our performance. So if you would turn to page three,\n",
            "[00:01:14,980 --> 00:01:20,180]  we start with Taiwan's mobile market status. And as you can see on the left-hand side,\n",
            "[00:01:20,180 --> 00:01:27,780]  the chart shows that Taiwan's mobile market penetration has already reached more than 125%.\n",
            "[00:01:28,900 --> 00:01:35,940]  This is a very saturated market. However, the good news is I think thanks to 5G,\n",
            "[00:01:35,940 --> 00:01:44,500]  the mobile service revenue, the declining path has finally come to an end. So in the second quarter,\n",
            "[00:01:44,580 --> 00:01:49,860]  the combined for the big three combined mobile service revenue has turned around and then\n",
            "[00:01:50,980 --> 00:02:01,060]  YOY becomes positive. However, FET has taken the lead and we turned positive in March. All right.\n",
            "[00:02:01,060 --> 00:02:10,340]  And for our financial performance, for the second quarter, our total revenue reached 19.4 or 19.5\n",
            "[00:02:10,340 --> 00:02:21,780]  billion. And then it is 1.5% better than our four targets. And it is actually 4.4% better than a\n",
            "[00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:33,700]  year ago. And also our EBITDA is 6.9 and almost 7 billion. And then it is 5% over our target and 2%\n",
            "[00:02:33,700 --> 00:02:41,620]  year over year growth. And for the net income, now remember for the first half last year,\n",
            "[00:02:43,380 --> 00:02:50,660]  we did not have the 5G amortization yet. And then of course, we started amortization in August.\n",
            "[00:02:50,660 --> 00:02:57,540]  So for the first half, the net income and then EPS, if we compare YOY, it would not be very good.\n",
            "[00:02:58,180 --> 00:03:04,500]  However, our achieved rate for target, for our board target is 20% for the second quarter. So it\n",
            "[00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:13,860]  was a very good quarter. And then year over year with the different base, and then it is almost 12%\n",
            "[00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:23,060]  less. Okay. And then for the first half, the result, we have reached 40.3 billion for revenue\n",
            "[00:03:23,060 --> 00:03:31,780]  and the 13.8 billion for EBITDA. And our net income is 3.8 billion. And then if you look at\n",
            "[00:03:31,780 --> 00:03:38,980]  the achieved rate in terms of our board target, it is a 15% better. And so is the case with our EPS.\n",
            "[00:03:41,460 --> 00:03:48,100]  And then if we look at our debt or free cash flow situation, we are improving our net debt\n",
            "[00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:55,060]  and also the net debt to EBITDA ratio. So our net debt from the first quarter, it was at a\n",
            "[00:03:55,060 --> 00:04:04,260]  63.8 billion or so level and has come down to 61.5 billion. And the net debt ratio also has\n",
            "[00:04:05,300 --> 00:04:16,190]  improved from 2.33 to 2.24. Okay. And our free cash flow has increased from 3.8 billion to\n",
            "[00:04:16,190 --> 00:04:24,210]  6.6 billion at the end of the second quarter. And for the cash-based CapEx, for the first quarter,\n",
            "[00:04:24,210 --> 00:04:31,090]  we only spent about 2.2 billion. And then in the second quarter, we sped up a little bit,\n",
            "[00:04:31,090 --> 00:04:42,160]  speed up a little bit. And it is now in 55.3 billion. And our budget for this year is actually\n",
            "[00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:52,190]  at about 14.9 billion. And then so we do have more cash CapEx expected for the second half.\n",
            "[00:04:52,190 --> 00:05:03,570]  And then so we are in line with our guidance. Now in terms of the FET's mobile service growth,\n",
            "[00:05:04,210 --> 00:05:11,760]  this is, as I pointed out, in month, year over year. And if you just look at the month over\n",
            "[00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:17,360]  month from this chart on the left, you can see in the second quarter, after second quarter,\n",
            "[00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:24,720]  that's when we launched 5G commercially. So you can see for the amount of the mobile service\n",
            "[00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:32,480]  revenue, every quarter, it has continued to grow. And finally, in March, we have already turned\n",
            "[00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:39,840]  positive. So for the entire second quarter, it is positive by 1.7% year over year.\n",
            "[00:05:40,860 --> 00:05:49,260]  And then this 5G also helped our post-pay and blended R pool. So for FET, our blended R pool\n",
            "[00:05:49,260 --> 00:05:57,470]  and post-pay R pool resumed growth in March and May respectively. And the percentage is not a lot,\n",
            "[00:05:57,470 --> 00:06:04,430]  but then it is significant in terms of we have had this declining R pool for so many quarters now.\n",
            "[00:06:04,430 --> 00:06:13,650]  And then that has finally been turned around. All right. And then in terms of our total revenue,\n",
            "[00:06:13,650 --> 00:06:20,210]  that is including both telecom and our new economy. So it is also very encouraging for\n",
            "[00:06:20,210 --> 00:06:28,450]  three quarters in a row that our worldwide growth continues. So when it comes to the second quarter,\n",
            "[00:06:28,450 --> 00:06:37,250]  we have 19.5 billion of our revenue total. And then on the right-hand side for the EBITDA,\n",
            "[00:06:37,250 --> 00:06:44,370]  we also have ‚Äì it has rebounded year over year. It has turned positive and mainly attributed to\n",
            "[00:06:44,370 --> 00:06:52,370]  the margin improvement and our cost optimization. For the revenue, even though 5G is helping with\n",
            "[00:06:52,370 --> 00:06:57,730]  the uplift and all that, but then telecom basically is still doesn't ‚Äì it's a saturated market,\n",
            "[00:06:57,730 --> 00:07:05,010]  so it doesn't grow as fast. So a big part of the revenue growth was driven by better handset sales\n",
            "[00:07:05,010 --> 00:07:21,660]  and also the ICT revenue. That has been our growing engine. Okay. So the next is business highlights.\n",
            "[00:07:21,660 --> 00:07:27,900]  In terms of our number of post-paid subscribers, even though this is a saturated market,\n",
            "[00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:35,660]  but then we have been increasing the number of post-paid customers for 11 quarters in a row now.\n",
            "[00:07:35,660 --> 00:07:43,020]  And then it is still the case for the second quarter this year. And the worldwide is 1.3% better.\n",
            "[00:07:43,020 --> 00:07:51,180]  And in terms of the churn, the market has been colder, granted. And we also continue to work on our churn.\n",
            "[00:07:51,180 --> 00:07:59,420]  So it continues to hit our record low. It is now at 1%. But then we are continuing to improve it\n",
            "[00:07:59,420 --> 00:08:10,190]  with more data analytics and customer insights. In terms of 5G, so far we have already deployed\n",
            "[00:08:10,190 --> 00:08:18,990]  more than 7,500 5G stations out there. And we already covered 90% of the six metropolitan areas.\n",
            "[00:08:18,990 --> 00:08:28,350]  And then for the nationwide, it is already above 80%. So we are targeting to deploy 9,000 by the end of the year,\n",
            "[00:08:28,350 --> 00:08:36,270]  if not sooner. And also the coverage for the whole nation or whole island will be more than 90% as well.\n",
            "[00:08:36,270 --> 00:08:46,930]  And we are also approaching 900,000 5G subscribers. And we are still targeting to reach 1 million by the end of August.\n",
            "[00:08:46,930 --> 00:08:54,690]  And also for those that sign up for 5G, and then 90%, more than 90% of them sign up for the high rate plan.\n",
            "[00:08:54,690 --> 00:09:09,950]  That is 999 a month or above. That is like $1,399. And then more than 20% of monthly fee uplift is contributed by the 5G renewal.\n",
            "[00:09:10,030 --> 00:09:21,310]  And then our 5G, it didn't take us long to reach the world-class 5G performance. So we have had our number one for several quarters in a row.\n",
            "[00:09:21,310 --> 00:09:34,270]  And recently one of the third party has certified Chunhua, our peer, to be the number one. And we congratulate them.\n",
            "[00:09:34,270 --> 00:09:40,510]  Because we have been expecting them to catch up eventually. And we are glad they caught up.\n",
            "[00:09:40,510 --> 00:09:50,030]  And so now we can, you know, we are really improving together. And I think that's good competition. And that is good for the consumers.\n",
            "[00:09:50,030 --> 00:10:00,510]  And then so they know other than Chunhua being always the number one or incumbent, they do have a choice and alternative that is far-eastern to choose from.\n",
            "[00:10:00,750 --> 00:10:06,270]  But we are glad we are both in the top two or the top performance, world-class performance together.\n",
            "[00:10:06,270 --> 00:10:20,990]  All right. And then for our new economy, just a little bit of history. So when we started this journey back in 2016, the new economy accounted for only 5% of our total revenue.\n",
            "[00:10:20,990 --> 00:10:31,390]  But today, for the first half, and this year, we actually had 16% as our target. But then for the first half, we already reached the target.\n",
            "[00:10:31,470 --> 00:10:38,670]  So in the first half, the new economy revenue already accounted for 16% of our total revenue.\n",
            "[00:10:38,670 --> 00:10:46,140]  Okay. So we are happy to see the growth that from many areas of the new economy.\n",
            "[00:10:46,140 --> 00:10:57,660]  On the right-hand side, you gave some examples. For example, like our ICT business, smart ICT business, even though because of the pandemic last year, it has a long-haul effect.\n",
            "[00:10:57,980 --> 00:11:07,100]  So for the first half, in terms of revenue realization, it's only 6% growth, but it still is growth.\n",
            "[00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:16,460]  And then if you look at the contract that we were able to win in the first quarter, and the contract value is almost 50% growth than the year before.\n",
            "[00:11:16,460 --> 00:11:26,860]  Okay. And for the media services, those are like the text, the SMS, which is a traditional service, granted.\n",
            "[00:11:26,860 --> 00:11:35,420]  But then because of all the one-time password, and then because of the pandemic, a lot of transactions are completed online.\n",
            "[00:11:35,420 --> 00:11:42,140]  So this becomes a very popular way of security confirmation and all that.\n",
            "[00:11:42,140 --> 00:11:53,260]  And on top of that, we also have this data analytics service that we offer to companies for more targeted marketing.\n",
            "[00:11:53,260 --> 00:12:00,060]  So this is also growing and contributing to the media service growth here for the 30% year-over-year.\n",
            "[00:12:00,060 --> 00:12:07,260]  And another thing that is definitely Warren's mentioning is our mobile commerce, although it is very small still.\n",
            "[00:12:07,260 --> 00:12:16,860]  And then last year, we had $2.1 billion of revenue from this small Friday shopping.\n",
            "[00:12:16,860 --> 00:12:23,260]  But then our growth for the first half is very impressive.\n",
            "[00:12:23,260 --> 00:12:29,420]  In May, it has reached 73.6% growth.\n",
            "[00:12:29,420 --> 00:12:32,540]  In June, it's like a 56.6%.\n",
            "[00:12:32,540 --> 00:12:37,900]  But then for the first half as a whole, that we see 37% of growth.\n",
            "[00:12:37,900 --> 00:12:43,420]  And then this will continue to grow as we have this mobile circle that we launched.\n",
            "[00:12:43,420 --> 00:12:51,260]  And then help will bring more traffic and also with our personalized recommendation engine that we will be able to boost,\n",
            "[00:12:51,260 --> 00:12:55,580]  help boost our Friday shopping sales as well.\n",
            "[00:12:55,580 --> 00:13:01,260]  And then also, we continue to be the number one direct carrier billing business.\n",
            "[00:13:01,260 --> 00:13:08,540]  And then it is also showing a growth of 13% year-over-year.\n",
            "[00:13:08,540 --> 00:13:15,900]  And then in the ICT area, we do see the rising demand, especially it's a smart ICT demand.\n",
            "[00:13:15,900 --> 00:13:24,300]  And a lot of this is really boosted by the government's attention and then also government itself is going through digital transformation.\n",
            "[00:13:24,300 --> 00:13:29,420]  So we see smart government, high-profile initiatives, and then also the smart health.\n",
            "[00:13:29,420 --> 00:13:36,620]  This is the first application we have been advocating that is the telemedicine,\n",
            "[00:13:36,620 --> 00:13:42,540]  because we see the real needs and then that 5G is able to fulfill for the society.\n",
            "[00:13:42,540 --> 00:13:50,380]  And especially it benefits those rural areas residents from lack of or insufficient medical resources.\n",
            "[00:13:50,380 --> 00:13:57,420]  And this with the Ministry of Health and Welfare support, this service that we launched for one province,\n",
            "[00:13:57,500 --> 00:14:03,660]  that's Taitung, well, one county actually, one county, Taitung County,\n",
            "[00:14:03,660 --> 00:14:09,100]  is now going to be prevalent to all the rural areas in Taiwan.\n",
            "[00:14:09,100 --> 00:14:23,340]  So this is also an opportunity for us since we are the first to launch this service and the model and the platform become the standard for the Ministry of Health and Welfare.\n",
            "[00:14:23,340 --> 00:14:34,820]  And then also we have provided this National Health Insurance Card, that is like another form of ID for Taiwan people here.\n",
            "[00:14:34,820 --> 00:14:42,420]  And then we also provided a mobile version of it as a POC for the Ministry of Health and Welfare.\n",
            "[00:14:42,420 --> 00:14:47,700]  And the use of it will support more use of the 5G telemedicine service.\n",
            "[00:14:47,700 --> 00:14:56,660]  So it will complete this service, because right now we have the 5G telemedicine service and the patient is at the far end.\n",
            "[00:14:56,660 --> 00:15:03,620]  But then for the doctors in the hospital here, you cannot have the physical card to scan or to process the payment.\n",
            "[00:15:03,620 --> 00:15:07,460]  So with the mobile card, then this will be just resolved.\n",
            "[00:15:07,460 --> 00:15:11,380]  So each piece to the puzzle is being put together.\n",
            "[00:15:11,460 --> 00:15:18,240]  And then Far Eastern is definitely defining that solution and is delivering that solution.\n",
            "[00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:24,080]  Okay, in the middle column we talked about various projects that are funded by the government.\n",
            "[00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:34,720]  And what I have to mention, in the past, Chunhua being the incumbent, so it is very hard for us to compete in the government section or segments.\n",
            "[00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:38,320]  But then I have to say my team has been really doing very well.\n",
            "[00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:42,480]  We work very hard and I think we have earned our credibility.\n",
            "[00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:52,880]  And so people start seeing that and we actually start getting a lot more, winning a lot more contracts with the government, which is encouraging.\n",
            "[00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:57,520]  And we definitely appreciate that and then we welcome more opportunities in this area.\n",
            "[00:15:57,520 --> 00:16:04,080]  So this is also helped fuel our growth in the ICT area.\n",
            "[00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:08,800]  So various government agencies, they are going through the digital transformation.\n",
            "[00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:22,800]  And we provided not only the IT kind of support from the infrastructure to build the data warehouse, data platform, or to provide the data analytics for the government.\n",
            "[00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:29,360]  And also we have a subsidiary that is focused on the cybersecurity.\n",
            "[00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:35,200]  So this is combined with our software capability that Bar-Eastone has.\n",
            "[00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:39,760]  So we are into these cloud and cybersecurity applications as well.\n",
            "[00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:46,080]  And then recently there is air conditioning in every classroom initiative.\n",
            "[00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:50,080]  The government has already passed a budget for it.\n",
            "[00:16:50,880 --> 00:17:06,290]  And then among all these counties that have these projects already formulated, we actually won more than 50% of it.\n",
            "[00:17:06,930 --> 00:17:12,530]  This is a big win for us and we are using our homegrown solution, energy management system.\n",
            "[00:17:13,170 --> 00:17:15,170]  And then this is a software-based solution.\n",
            "[00:17:15,970 --> 00:17:18,130]  So this is a good win for us.\n",
            "[00:17:18,370 --> 00:17:28,530]  And then also it will contribute to about a billion or so revenue once it's all completed in the second half of the year.\n",
            "[00:17:28,530 --> 00:17:39,490]  And the 5G private network, since we have a really world-class performance 5G, and so the 5G private network is another area of our focus.\n",
            "[00:17:39,810 --> 00:17:50,050]  One of the verticals that will in particular require the private network is in the smart manufacturing area.\n",
            "[00:17:50,050 --> 00:17:59,010]  So our cooperation with one of the biggest delta electronics.\n",
            "[00:17:59,010 --> 00:18:07,490]  So that is the first 5G private network smart factory that we deployed or launched early next year.\n",
            "[00:18:07,650 --> 00:18:09,650]  Last year, I'm sorry, early last year.\n",
            "[00:18:09,650 --> 00:18:18,610]  And then because of the pandemic, so certainly a lot of companies were more tight or more cautious in terms of their capital spending.\n",
            "[00:18:18,610 --> 00:18:30,850]  But we do see from this particular example that the good return for this kind of investment to upgrade your factory with 5G kind of private network,\n",
            "[00:18:30,930 --> 00:18:45,410]  with the communication network, and with smart, with AI, and then this productivity increase from the factory is going to well justify the investment.\n",
            "[00:18:45,410 --> 00:18:59,870]  And also we have other different verticals or in the southern areas where they need private networks that we can design for them as we have very good network solutions.\n",
            "[00:19:00,030 --> 00:19:03,390]  And also best performance 5G that we can provide.\n",
            "[00:19:03,390 --> 00:19:09,310]  So this is one area we continue to grow and with the pandemic almost behind us.\n",
            "[00:19:09,310 --> 00:19:21,070]  And we see the, even during the pandemic, we actually were asked for some emergency help and support to upgrade some of the factories with the 5G network.\n",
            "[00:19:21,070 --> 00:19:25,950]  So that actually gave us some business opportunities, business deals as well.\n",
            "[00:19:26,350 --> 00:19:28,900]  Okay.\n",
            "[00:19:28,900 --> 00:19:35,220]  And okay, then it comes to some of the major awards that we received in the second quarter.\n",
            "[00:19:35,220 --> 00:19:38,340]  And the first one is from the institutional investor.\n",
            "[00:19:38,340 --> 00:19:42,660]  And some of you probably have voted for Far Eastern for us, and we appreciate that.\n",
            "[00:19:42,660 --> 00:19:46,980]  Certainly it's a great honor and we'll continue to do better.\n",
            "[00:19:46,980 --> 00:19:47,860]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:19:47,860 --> 00:19:56,260]  And we also have some other awards in the ESG areas, such as our carbon disclosure project.\n",
            "[00:19:56,260 --> 00:20:03,220]  And we are one of the CDP supplier engagement leaders that is rated A.\n",
            "[00:20:03,220 --> 00:20:10,900]  And our company is again ranked top 5% corporate governance companies.\n",
            "[00:20:10,900 --> 00:20:12,820]  That's seven years in a row.\n",
            "[00:20:12,820 --> 00:20:13,300]  Okay.\n",
            "[00:20:13,300 --> 00:20:23,410]  And we have other, you know, innovation-related awards as well, just for your information.\n",
            "[00:20:23,410 --> 00:20:30,370]  And then we, even during pandemic, you know, we support our community and that just didn't stop.\n",
            "[00:20:30,370 --> 00:20:34,690]  So earlier I mentioned about our telemedicine service.\n",
            "[00:20:34,690 --> 00:20:40,770]  That was for the rural areas, as always, that is what the government has planned.\n",
            "[00:20:40,770 --> 00:20:50,530]  But then as the pandemic hit Taiwan in May, so we saw what the rest of the globe saw last year, right?\n",
            "[00:20:50,530 --> 00:20:52,610]  People do not want to go to the hospital.\n",
            "[00:20:53,490 --> 00:20:57,890]  And then that was quite sudden in May.\n",
            "[00:20:57,890 --> 00:21:06,530]  So we worked with Far Eastern Hospital and then make this telemedicine available on the mobile as an application.\n",
            "[00:21:06,530 --> 00:21:14,050]  So for patients that they don't want to go to the hospital for non-COVID-19-related issues,\n",
            "[00:21:14,050 --> 00:21:20,050]  that they can actually use our platform, this communication platform, to consult with the doctors.\n",
            "[00:21:21,010 --> 00:21:23,570]  And then so this was deployed.\n",
            "[00:21:23,570 --> 00:21:29,250]  And then, you know, shortly after that, we already have thousands of patients benefit from that.\n",
            "[00:21:29,250 --> 00:21:36,450]  And then we are working with five other hospitals at the same time to deploy this similar solution.\n",
            "[00:21:36,450 --> 00:21:43,650]  And then so I'm sure this will become more prevalent as people start seeing the benefits of it.\n",
            "[00:21:43,650 --> 00:21:47,250]  It's not just for rural areas, even for urban areas.\n",
            "[00:21:47,250 --> 00:21:50,690]  People don't have to spend that much time in the hospital waiting.\n",
            "[00:21:50,690 --> 00:21:56,690]  If we have a better communication system over a good 5G network, over a good 5G phone,\n",
            "[00:21:56,690 --> 00:22:01,730]  and then they can be seen by the doctors over this mobile communication.\n",
            "[00:22:03,250 --> 00:22:11,970]  And also as Taiwan government has finally approved to have more testing vehicles or stations\n",
            "[00:22:11,970 --> 00:22:15,170]  to be set up for vaccination or testing.\n",
            "[00:22:15,170 --> 00:22:16,850]  And then there was a great need.\n",
            "[00:22:16,850 --> 00:22:21,490]  And then so we were setting up these 5G, you know, boosters or, you know,\n",
            "[00:22:21,490 --> 00:22:25,570]  just to make sure that their communication needs can be better served.\n",
            "[00:22:27,250 --> 00:22:32,930]  And also because of the pandemic, a lot of people started working from home.\n",
            "[00:22:32,930 --> 00:22:35,570]  So the network traffic definitely changed.\n",
            "[00:22:35,570 --> 00:22:39,730]  And a lot of people cannot work from home and they stay home.\n",
            "[00:22:39,730 --> 00:22:44,930]  And like for students, they will have to do this online learning.\n",
            "[00:22:44,930 --> 00:22:51,490]  So all that contributes to the 30% year-over-year growth in terms of our network usage.\n",
            "[00:22:51,490 --> 00:22:56,770]  So that's a lot of increase in a very short time.\n",
            "[00:22:56,770 --> 00:23:01,730]  So we do see more complaints coming from the users, from the consumers.\n",
            "[00:23:01,730 --> 00:23:06,930]  So we have been deploying additional 4G network capacity for this relief, okay?\n",
            "[00:23:07,650 --> 00:23:12,610]  And then now it's already getting better as more people now start going back to work.\n",
            "[00:23:13,170 --> 00:23:17,250]  And then life resumes a little bit more normal now, okay?\n",
            "[00:23:19,410 --> 00:23:24,130]  We also provide cloud service for the COVID-19 vaccination registration.\n",
            "[00:23:24,770 --> 00:23:26,370]  This is a big thing, right?\n",
            "[00:23:26,370 --> 00:23:30,850]  Because everybody wants to, almost everybody wants to get vaccinated.\n",
            "[00:23:31,730 --> 00:23:38,290]  This registration and reservation system is hosted on the cloud service that provided by\n",
            "[00:23:39,090 --> 00:23:39,810]  Far Eastone.\n",
            "[00:23:40,450 --> 00:23:46,050]  And also for the COVID-19 contact tracing.\n",
            "[00:23:46,050 --> 00:23:49,010]  And this is using the geofencing and geolocation.\n",
            "[00:23:50,450 --> 00:23:57,410]  And then this has a lot to do with the capability for geofencing and geolocating.\n",
            "[00:23:57,410 --> 00:24:01,490]  And FED is best at that, among all the telcos, I can say that.\n",
            "[00:24:02,210 --> 00:24:05,810]  And then to support this government solution, okay?\n",
            "[00:24:05,810 --> 00:24:11,970]  And also we have donated SIM cards, tablets, and the wireless routers for rural students\n",
            "[00:24:11,970 --> 00:24:17,490]  or for those that are in need in order for them to be able to do the remote learning.\n",
            "[00:24:17,490 --> 00:24:23,250]  And that is just some small things that we do as kind of part of our profession.\n",
            "[00:24:23,250 --> 00:24:28,220]  And we can easily or readily help our communities, okay?\n",
            "[00:24:29,180 --> 00:24:36,700]  And so for our second half priority, we will accelerate our 5G coverage and user penetration.\n",
            "[00:24:36,700 --> 00:24:42,620]  And that is in terms of covering the nationwide for to reach 90%.\n",
            "[00:24:43,500 --> 00:24:48,620]  And for our user penetration, our first major milestone will be the 1 million that we are\n",
            "[00:24:48,620 --> 00:24:50,300]  looking at end of August.\n",
            "[00:24:51,100 --> 00:24:56,940]  And then hopefully another hundred few thousand by the end of the year.\n",
            "[00:24:57,820 --> 00:25:04,140]  And also we will continue to grow the total customer value and then on the consumer side.\n",
            "[00:25:04,140 --> 00:25:13,820]  So we use this mobile circle that will combine our telecom services and the new economy service\n",
            "[00:25:13,820 --> 00:25:22,620]  that either we created from in-house like our Friday video and then our shopping.\n",
            "[00:25:22,700 --> 00:25:29,020]  And then we also work with many customers, many partners that will provide and will curate\n",
            "[00:25:29,020 --> 00:25:35,260]  different services that will best suit our customer needs because we have good customer\n",
            "[00:25:35,260 --> 00:25:41,420]  360 kind of insights and then we can do more personalized recommendation for our consumers.\n",
            "[00:25:41,420 --> 00:25:46,060]  And then so, you know, it's not just a commercial to them but it's some helpful\n",
            "[00:25:46,060 --> 00:25:47,820]  information for them.\n",
            "[00:25:47,820 --> 00:25:53,660]  And then so we can grow the total revenue or the total contributions of these subscribers\n",
            "[00:25:53,660 --> 00:25:59,420]  that they can consume through this mobile circle for the services that we provide to them, okay?\n",
            "[00:26:01,140 --> 00:26:08,100]  And on the industry or enterprise side, we will continue to expand our ITT business and\n",
            "[00:26:08,100 --> 00:26:09,940]  also we have one many projects.\n",
            "[00:26:09,940 --> 00:26:17,460]  So the second half, we will have a lot of projects to finish and then at the same time\n",
            "[00:26:17,460 --> 00:26:22,900]  we'll continue to build our alliance with other partners that may be across different\n",
            "[00:26:22,900 --> 00:26:23,940]  industries.\n",
            "[00:26:23,940 --> 00:26:31,380]  And as we see, many of these ITT projects or ITT related work, you know, one company\n",

            "[00:30:09,680 --> 00:30:11,280]  them to buy is also different.\n",
            "[00:30:11,280 --> 00:30:15,840]  So we use personalized recommendation engine in this.\n",
            "[00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:22,080]  So each time the customer, you know, log in or sign into the app and then they stay actually\n",

            "[00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:35,120]  And then we have with customers or with other partners that we also offer, you know, because\n",
            "[00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:36,880]  we don't own restaurants and all that.\n",
            "[00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:42,240]  But then we have, you know, alliance with like partnership with 7-Eleven.\n",
            "[00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:49,840]  We have like with the three major convenience stores in convenience store chains in Taiwan.\n",

            "[00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:58,960]  So you have this coffee coupon that you can redeem in any of these three, you know, chain\n",
            "[00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:01,120]  stores that you can get coffee.\n",
            "[00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:03,040]  And then that is for the convenience.\n",
            "[00:31:03,040 --> 00:31:08,400]  And also with Kentucky Fried Chicken, for example, and then they offer special discounts\n",
            "[00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:10,720]  to Far Eastern subscribers.\n",
            "[00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:17,200]  So and then we, you know, we gave this, we kick in these discounts for our subscribers.\n",
            "[00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:22,160]  And this mobile circle is for Far Eastern subscribers only.\n",
            "[00:31:22,160 --> 00:31:25,840]  So this is a reward, a membership program kind of thing.\n",
            "[00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:28,000]  And then it serves several purposes.\n",
            "[00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:32,880]  First is like we want to strengthen the engagement with our consumers.\n",
            "[00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:35,280]  We want to strengthen their loyalty.\n",
            "[00:31:35,280 --> 00:31:40,960]  So they see themselves as the Far Eastern, you know, customers.\n",
            "[00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:45,280]  And then there is a lot that we offer to our valued customers.\n",
            "[00:31:45,280 --> 00:31:49,280]  And then through this, you know, through this engagement there are different services that\n",
            "[00:31:49,280 --> 00:31:51,520]  we can provide to serve their needs.\n",
            "[00:31:51,520 --> 00:31:56,640]  And once they consume, you know, through this mobile circle and then those become and then\n",
            "[00:31:56,640 --> 00:32:03,520]  either we have profit sharing with the partners or those are the services that we created\n",
            "[00:32:03,520 --> 00:32:04,320]  ourselves.\n",
            "[00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:10,480]  So by doing this, we are no longer only, you know, looking at these customers as they pay\n",
            "[00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:15,040]  $13.99 or $999 a month for the telecom service.\n",
            "[00:32:15,040 --> 00:32:24,080]  But there's all these additional things that they consume or they buy from us.\n",
            "[00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:31,600]  So that's how we can add up the value or contribution every customer of ours that will\n",
            "[00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:33,520]  be able to contribute.\n",
            "[00:32:35,940 --> 00:32:36,580]  Okay.\n",
            "[00:32:36,580 --> 00:32:37,940]  That answers your first question.\n",
            "[00:32:38,820 --> 00:32:42,740]  And the second question is regarding the ICT revenue.\n",
            "[00:32:42,740 --> 00:32:46,260]  Like how much or what's the percentage of a recurring?\n",
            "[00:32:47,090 --> 00:32:49,250]  And do we have an answer right away?\n",
            "[00:32:49,250 --> 00:33:07,730]  I can answer so we can have it each.\n",
            "[00:33:07,730 --> 00:33:08,050]  Yeah.\n",
            "[00:33:08,050 --> 00:33:15,490]  So for the ICT business, a lot of them actually would have after the project is finished.\n",
            "[00:33:15,490 --> 00:33:19,250]  But it's not the whole thing is finished because what would come after that is the\n",
            "[00:33:19,250 --> 00:33:23,170]  maintenance, the managed service that they will ask us to provide.\n",
            "[00:33:23,170 --> 00:33:26,610]  So that is that will become the recurring part.\n",
            "[00:33:26,610 --> 00:33:28,850]  We don't and then that usually it's about 10%.\n",
            "[00:33:29,490 --> 00:33:32,610]  So right now, we actually don't have exact number on that.\n",
            "[00:33:32,610 --> 00:33:33,650]  We can look into it.\n",
            "[00:33:34,130 --> 00:33:36,910]  Some projects also go from years.\n",
            "[00:33:36,910 --> 00:33:38,940]  So that's also different.\n",
            "[00:33:39,500 --> 00:33:39,740]  Right.\n",
            "[00:33:39,740 --> 00:33:42,820]  Just like the smart streetlight project, right?\n",
            "[00:33:42,820 --> 00:33:46,100]  That is 15 years of contract.\n",
            "[00:33:46,100 --> 00:33:49,540]  And then so we will get this managed service for 15 years.\n",
            "[00:33:51,380 --> 00:33:52,260]  So it varies.\n",
            "[00:33:52,260 --> 00:33:52,820]  It varies.\n",
            "[00:33:52,820 --> 00:33:56,020]  But then we can look at that percentage overall.\n",
            "[00:33:57,730 --> 00:33:58,130]  All right.\n",
            "[00:33:58,130 --> 00:34:03,250]  And the third question I think is about 5G and then guidance.\n",
            "[00:34:07,500 --> 00:34:10,300]  Sarah, are you talking about guidance on DPS?\n",
            "[00:34:13,470 --> 00:34:13,710]  Yeah.\n",
            "[00:34:13,710 --> 00:34:18,910]  So yeah, any change in the type of guidance?\n",
            "[00:34:18,910 --> 00:34:19,150]  Yeah.\n",
            "[00:34:19,150 --> 00:34:24,510]  For this year and then what's our target number of 5G base station by the end of this year?\n",
            "[00:34:25,340 --> 00:34:25,740]  Okay.\n",
            "[00:34:25,740 --> 00:34:28,140]  So that's what I have said.\n",
            "[00:34:28,140 --> 00:34:31,740]  9,000, you know, that's our budget number.\n",
            "[00:34:32,620 --> 00:34:37,500]  And also, right now, we already have deployed 7,500.\n",
            "[00:34:37,500 --> 00:34:39,980]  So there's like another 1,500 to go.\n",
            "[00:34:50,530 --> 00:34:50,850]  Okay.\n",
            "[00:34:50,850 --> 00:34:53,250]  Sarah, is that what you're asking for?\n",
            "[00:34:55,410 --> 00:34:55,730]  Yeah.\n",

            "[00:34:56,130 --> 00:34:58,130]  And then is there any change in the guidance?\n",
            "[00:34:58,930 --> 00:34:59,250]  No.\n",
            "[00:34:59,250 --> 00:35:01,890]  Cat pass or even revenue or profit?\n",
            "[00:35:01,890 --> 00:35:02,690]  I see.\n",
            "[00:35:02,690 --> 00:35:03,490]  Got it.\n",

            "[00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000]  After the presentation, there will be a question and answer session.\n",
            "[00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:17,100]  Please follow the instructions given at that time if you would like to ask a question.\n",
            "[00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:23,100]  For your information, the broadcast replay will be available within an hour after the conference is finished.\n",

            "[00:00:30,100 --> 00:00:34,100]  And now I would like to introduce Mr. Gary Lai, the IR officer.\n",
            "[00:00:34,100 --> 00:00:36,100]  And Gary, please begin.\n",
            "[00:00:36,100 --> 00:00:44,450]  Good afternoon everyone. Thank you very much for attending Far East Tone first quarter 2021 result conference call.\n",
            "[00:00:44,450 --> 00:00:49,450]  Our President Xi and CFO Sharon both joined the call with us today.\n",
            "[00:00:49,450 --> 00:00:56,450]  Before Xi's brief presentation, please kindly pay attention to the state of our statement in the first stage of our presentation.\n",
            "[00:00:56,450 --> 00:00:58,450]  May we pass to Xi.\n",
            "[00:00:58,450 --> 00:00:59,450]  Thank you, Gary.\n",
            "[00:00:59,450 --> 00:01:02,450]  Alright, good afternoon ladies and gentlemen.\n",
            "[00:01:02,450 --> 00:01:04,450]  Thank you for joining us.\n",
            "[00:01:04,450 --> 00:01:07,450]  We have very good first quarter to report.\n",
            "[00:01:07,450 --> 00:01:12,450]  But then let me start with mobile market in Taiwan, just a brief overview.\n",
            "[00:01:12,450 --> 00:01:18,450]  As you are all aware, the total mobile customers in Taiwan has been pretty saturated.\n",
            "[00:01:18,450 --> 00:01:26,450]  And we are looking at 29.3 million, slightly addition from the previous quarters.\n",
            "[00:01:26,450 --> 00:01:33,450]  And then in terms of the mobile service revenue, I think a good sign of hope is,\n",
            "[00:01:33,450 --> 00:01:37,450]  as you have been hearing, that we said the mobile service has been declining.\n",
            "[00:01:37,450 --> 00:01:41,450]  But then finally, I think it showed a sign of turnaround or rebound.\n",
            "[00:01:41,450 --> 00:01:45,450]  And this can show in the chart on the right.\n",
            "[00:01:45,450 --> 00:01:53,450]  So from the quarterly revenue in the NT million dollars, and you can see that in terms of the YOY.\n",
            "[00:01:53,450 --> 00:02:03,450]  So in the first quarter, 21, it is the YOY believed to be minus 1.3% versus previous quarters,\n",
            "[00:02:03,450 --> 00:02:09,450]  excuse me, we were like in the 5% or even more percent as an industry.\n",
            "[00:02:09,450 --> 00:02:12,450]  However, I'm happy to report that.\n",
            "[00:02:12,450 --> 00:02:20,450]  FET actually has the YOY turned positive in March, just last month.\n",
            "[00:02:20,450 --> 00:02:21,450]  Okay.\n",
            "[00:02:21,450 --> 00:02:28,450]  And then in terms of the mobile service performance for FET specifically,\n",
            "[00:02:28,450 --> 00:02:33,450]  even though the market has been very stable or relatively cold,\n",
            "[00:02:33,450 --> 00:02:38,450]  and we still managed to continue to grow our post-paid subscribers.\n",
            "[00:02:38,450 --> 00:02:44,540]  So for the first quarter, we managed to grow 1% of the post-paid customers.\n",
            "[00:02:44,540 --> 00:02:50,540]  And then on the other hand, for the churn rate, then we hit another record low at the 1%.\n",
            "[00:02:50,540 --> 00:02:55,540]  So this gives us a very stable base and then to grow our revenue\n",
            "[00:02:55,540 --> 00:03:01,540]  and then to promote our 5G programs even more.\n",
            "[00:03:01,540 --> 00:03:05,540]  And then in terms of the R pool on the right-hand side, as you know,\n",
            "[00:03:05,540 --> 00:03:10,540]  FET has been leading in our R pool for both post-paid and blended R pools.\n",
            "[00:03:10,540 --> 00:03:17,540]  And not only that, in March, we also have our blended R pool turned,\n",
            "[00:03:17,540 --> 00:03:20,540]  YOY turned positive and then ahead of peers\n",
            "[00:03:20,540 --> 00:03:24,540]  and then also three months ahead of our own regional projection\n",
            "[00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:29,540]  as we projected in our last IR call with you all.\n",
            "[00:03:29,540 --> 00:03:34,730]  So it's three months ahead of our original target.\n",
            "[00:03:34,730 --> 00:03:36,730]  And then talk about 5G.\n",
            "[00:03:36,730 --> 00:03:40,730]  So our 5G adoption continues very steadily\n",
            "[00:03:40,730 --> 00:03:44,730]  and still more than 90% of our 5G customers\n",
            "[00:03:44,730 --> 00:03:51,730]  that they signed up for the higher rate plan, that is the $9.99 or $13.99.\n",
            "[00:03:51,730 --> 00:03:55,730]  And then the average monthly fee for renewal customers\n",
            "[00:03:55,730 --> 00:03:59,730]  has shown more than 20% of uplift.\n",
            "[00:03:59,730 --> 00:04:02,730]  So this is where we really have been looking for\n",
            "[00:04:02,730 --> 00:04:07,730]  and expecting this 5G monthly fee uplift to help with our overall revenue.\n",
            "[00:04:07,730 --> 00:04:10,730]  And then it is definitely doing its trick.\n",
            "[00:04:10,730 --> 00:04:15,730]  And then currently we already have more than 6,100 NR stations,\n",
            "[00:04:15,730 --> 00:04:17,730]  5G NR stations deployed.\n",
            "[00:04:17,730 --> 00:04:22,730]  And then the coverage nationwide is about more than 70%.\n",
            "[00:04:22,730 --> 00:04:26,730]  And then for the metropolitan area, it is over 80%.\n",
            "[00:04:26,730 --> 00:04:30,730]  And for Taipei, it's close to 90%.\n",
            "[00:04:30,730 --> 00:04:33,730]  And then we target the nationwide coverage\n",
            "[00:04:33,730 --> 00:04:36,730]  to be more than 90% before the end of the year\n",
            "[00:04:36,730 --> 00:04:40,080]  and hopefully before the fourth quarter.\n",
            "[00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:45,080]  And then in terms of our 5G performance,\n",
            "[00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:52,080]  you probably have heard that FET has the best or the fastest 5G network in Taiwan.\n",
            "[00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:55,080]  And we won it again two times in a row\n",
            "[00:04:55,080 --> 00:05:01,080]  and it's certified by OpenSignal and Speedtest UKLA, respectively.\n",
            "[00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:07,080]  And then also Taiwan moves up to number two worldwide in the 5G download speed.\n",
            "[00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:10,080]  And then we definitely had something to do with that.\n",
            "[00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:13,080]  So we are happy to report.\n",
            "[00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:16,080]  We definitely had a very good start with 5G,\n",
            "[00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:20,080]  how we position ourselves in 5G is a winning position.\n",
            "[00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:23,110]  And we are very happy about it.\n",
            "[00:05:23,110 --> 00:05:25,110]  And then in terms of our new economy,\n",
            "[00:05:25,110 --> 00:05:28,110]  we also showed a very strong first quarter\n",
            "[00:05:28,110 --> 00:05:33,270]  and looking at 11% year-over-year growth.\n",
            "[00:05:33,270 --> 00:05:39,270]  And then in the major growth areas, that includes the cloud resale.\n",
            "[00:05:39,270 --> 00:05:44,270]  And then this is actually for both of our coming from our major subsidiary,\n",
            "[00:05:44,270 --> 00:05:47,270]  the cloud resale company,\n",
            "[00:05:47,270 --> 00:05:51,270]  and then also for FET cloud that we homegrown\n",
            "[00:05:51,270 --> 00:05:54,270]  and then provided a service is also growing.\n",
            "[00:05:54,270 --> 00:05:59,270]  So combined we are looking at 48% year-over-year growth in the first quarter.\n",
            "[00:05:59,270 --> 00:06:02,270]  And our e-commerce, while it's small,\n",
            "[00:06:02,270 --> 00:06:06,270]  but then still it shows significant momentum here\n",
            "[00:06:06,270 --> 00:06:11,270]  with the 26% posted growth year-over-year.\n",
            "[00:06:11,270 --> 00:06:14,270]  And then we continue to lead in our direct carrier billing area\n",
            "[00:06:14,270 --> 00:06:19,270]  and it also shows a good growth for 12%.\n",
            "[00:06:19,270 --> 00:06:25,270]  And the media services continues to grow at 29% year-over-year.\n",
            "[00:06:25,270 --> 00:06:31,540]  And some service highlights, 5G is new,\n",
            "[00:06:31,540 --> 00:06:36,540]  so our marketing department has been very creative and innovative\n",
            "[00:06:36,540 --> 00:06:42,540]  in terms of offering various services that are closer to our customers.\n",
            "[00:06:42,540 --> 00:06:46,540]  So for example, one major initiative actually is company-wide,\n",
            "[00:06:46,540 --> 00:06:49,540]  so it's not just a marketing campaign.\n",
            "[00:06:49,540 --> 00:06:54,540]  We actually see that as a major effort for us to get closer to our customers\n",
            "[00:06:54,540 --> 00:06:58,540]  and to build better customer engagement.\n",
            "[00:06:58,540 --> 00:07:02,540]  And so we kick off or deploy this customer loyalty program,\n",
            "[00:07:02,540 --> 00:07:07,540]  which is also a platform that we call FET Mobile Circle.\n",
            "[00:07:07,540 --> 00:07:12,540]  And then it is already since its deployment that was in November last year,\n",
            "[00:07:12,540 --> 00:07:14,540]  we had a soft launch.\n",
            "[00:07:14,540 --> 00:07:17,540]  We already have 220 million downloads.\n",
            "[00:07:17,540 --> 00:07:22,540]  And then we have more than a million active FET users.\n",
            "[00:07:22,540 --> 00:07:27,540]  This definitely helps us to engage our users more.\n",
            "[00:07:27,540 --> 00:07:32,540]  And then because we offer quite a variety of services with discounts or with rewards,\n",
            "[00:07:32,540 --> 00:07:38,540]  and like we use FET points where they can burn the points\n",
            "[00:07:38,540 --> 00:07:44,540]  and then use towards our shopping and some of the bills that they pay for FET services.\n",
            "[00:07:44,540 --> 00:07:49,540]  And also this helps actually boost our shopping revenue as well\n",
            "[00:07:49,540 --> 00:07:54,540]  because it can lead the user, the traffic, to our shopping.\n",
            "[00:07:54,540 --> 00:08:00,540]  And then we see millions of dollars that they were able to convert into the sales\n",
            "[00:08:00,540 --> 00:08:03,540]  for our easy Friday shopping.\n",
            "[00:08:03,540 --> 00:08:07,540]  And then also in terms of our video subscription, Friday video,\n",
            "[00:08:07,540 --> 00:08:12,540]  so our digital entertainment services, through this Mobile Circle engagement,\n",
            "[00:08:12,540 --> 00:08:18,540]  we actually see thousands of increase in terms of the new acquisition of these new users.\n",
            "[00:08:18,540 --> 00:08:26,540]  So we are very happy with this loyalty program, which will continue to enrich the content\n",
            "[00:08:26,540 --> 00:08:31,540]  and then also offer more things that our customers will need.\n",
            "[00:08:31,540 --> 00:08:38,540]  And this is members only, so it's an exclusive program for FET users only.\n",
            "[00:08:38,540 --> 00:08:42,540]  And then we want our customers to feel they are special.\n",
            "[00:08:42,540 --> 00:08:44,540]  You know, be a FET user.\n",
            "[00:08:44,540 --> 00:08:45,540]  It is special.\n",
            "[00:08:45,540 --> 00:08:48,540]  And then this is how we do it through this Mobile Circle.\n",
            "[00:08:48,540 --> 00:08:54,960]  And then we have a couple other campaigns, like we have a gaming program.\n",
            "[00:08:54,960 --> 00:09:00,960]  As we know, the gamers, they are usually very loyal, and then they demand high quality of network,\n",
            "[00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:04,960]  which we do provide good quality of network service.\n",
            "[00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:09,960]  And then they are also, they tend to use high-end kinds of devices.\n",
            "[00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:17,960]  And then so we have this program we partner with NCSoft, the mobile game Paradise 2M.\n",
            "[00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:20,960]  And I have to admit, I'm not a gamer myself.\n",
            "[00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:22,960]  So then we have a picture on the side.\n",
            "[00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:24,960]  Hopefully some of you recognize that.\n",
            "[00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:27,960]  Apparently, as I was told, that was a very famous game.\n",
            "[00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:29,960]  It's a very popular game.\n",
            "[00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:36,960]  And then so we have some promotion going on using this partnership with Paradise 2M.\n",
            "[00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:43,960]  And then also, we have this Taj Mahal pilgrimage.\n",
            "[00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:46,960]  This is a goddess, right, a local goddess.\n",
            "[00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:52,960]  And actually, this is one of the most popular religious events in Taiwan.\n",
            "[00:09:52,960 --> 00:10:02,960]  So we actually have a special package provided for customers who would sign up for our 5G program,\n",
            "[00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:09,960]  like a 13-month plus, and this is only for the local customers that are in the central Taiwan area.\n",
            "[00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:12,960]  So it's specifically designed for the customers there.\n",
            "[00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:17,380]  And we actually got half of the takers were non-FET users.\n",
            "[00:10:17,380 --> 00:10:22,380]  So that was a very good acquisition, the new acquisition.\n",
            "[00:10:22,380 --> 00:10:24,380]  So it was all good.\n",
            "[00:10:24,380 --> 00:10:31,380]  And also, we have unveiled Taiwan's first real 5G smart factory.\n",
            "[00:10:31,380 --> 00:10:35,380]  It is co-built by us and the Delta Electronics and Microsoft.\n",
            "[00:10:35,380 --> 00:10:40,380]  And then this event took off in, I think, in March in Taoyuan,\n",
            "[00:10:40,380 --> 00:10:45,380]  and then actually see the smart manufacturing in work.\n",
            "[00:10:46,380 --> 00:10:54,380]  So you see how they use the 5G connectivity to direct their automation within the factory.\n",
            "[00:10:54,380 --> 00:11:00,410]  So it's very amazing, and we were hoping to use this as a real-life demo,\n",
            "[00:11:00,410 --> 00:11:07,410]  and then that will attract more interest from the rest of the manufacturing industry.\n",
            "[00:11:07,410 --> 00:11:10,410]  And although every industry has different models,\n",
            "[00:11:10,410 --> 00:11:15,410]  but then in terms of the need and the kind of flexibility that 5G,\n",
            "[00:11:15,410 --> 00:11:22,410]  and then reliability that 5G could provide over the Wi-Fi, that is universal.\n",
            "[00:11:22,410 --> 00:11:23,410]  That is the thing.\n",
            "[00:11:23,410 --> 00:11:28,410]  So we do see that in the manufacturing area that we do see more opportunities\n",
            "[00:11:28,410 --> 00:11:32,500]  with the 5G private network offering.\n",
            "[00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:38,500]  And then also, again, in our telemedicine, as we are number one ahead of our peers\n",
            "[00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:42,500]  and probably the only one that is really making significant progress.\n",
            "[00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:48,500]  And then we are recognized by our government welfare department for our efforts in Taichung.\n",
            "[00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:56,500]  And then so the government actually has made Taichung an exemplary case\n",
            "[00:11:56,500 --> 00:12:02,500]  and then asked the other regulations to follow the same suit.\n",
            "[00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:09,500]  So for all the hard-to-reach suburb areas, that they will all follow the same model.\n",
            "[00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:17,500]  And then the government is having the budget allocated for those areas to also be equipped\n",
            "[00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:20,500]  with 5G telemedicine kind of capabilities.\n",
            "[00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:24,500]  We are definitely an incumbent and a major player there.\n",
            "[00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:31,500]  And then we see at the same time, not only we're expanding the areas where telemedicine is available\n",
            "[00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:38,500]  and also the type of telemedicine services, the kinds of special areas that it can cover,\n",
            "[00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:40,500]  that it is also expanding.\n",
            "[00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:48,500]  And my team, my product manager is working very diligently with the medical device vendors\n",
            "[00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:53,500]  or manufacturers to find the right kind of equipment and with the doctors\n",
            "[00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:57,500]  to expand the kind of services that telemedicine can cover.\n",
            "[00:12:57,500 --> 00:13:02,500]  So it is very encouraging and very rewarding experience working with our 5G\n",
            "[00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:09,500]  and to help with the telemedicine and to help balance the resources between the urban and the rural areas.\n",
            "[00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:10,730]  Okay.\n",
            "[00:13:10,730 --> 00:13:16,730]  And then we have some awards and some recognition we received here today,\n",
            "[00:13:16,730 --> 00:13:21,730]  including that we were ranked top 5% corporate governance company.\n",
            "[00:13:21,730 --> 00:13:24,730]  And that is evaluated by Taiwan Stock Exchange.\n",
            "[00:13:24,730 --> 00:13:27,730]  And it is seven years in a row.\n",
            "[00:13:27,730 --> 00:13:34,730]  And also we were granted the S&P Global Silver Class in the Sustainability Yearbook 2021.\n",
            "[00:13:34,730 --> 00:13:41,730]  And also many thanks to probably some of you, if not all of you, for voting for us and for myself.\n",
            "[00:13:41,730 --> 00:13:47,730]  And so we were really flattered and pleased and very humbled that we were awarded\n",
            "[00:13:47,730 --> 00:13:53,820]  Best CEO and Best Investor Relations by Finance Asia.\n",

            "[00:13:56,820 --> 00:13:58,820]  That was a really pleasant surprise.\n",
            "[00:13:58,820 --> 00:14:00,820]  But then thank you all for your support.\n",
            "[00:14:00,820 --> 00:14:03,500]  And we will continue to do better.\n",
            "[00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:10,500]  And then we also won the 2020 Smart Taipei Innovation Award from Taipei City for our smart car project.\n",
            "[00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:19,500]  And that is using 5G to help those device makers to actually do all kinds of testing,\n",
            "[00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:21,500]  the network entry testing.\n",
            "[00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:23,500]  We provided the site.\n",
            "[00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:27,500]  And it was a good 5G coverage for them to do that.\n",

            "[00:17:14,050 --> 00:17:17,050]  truly it's going to be our year-long priority.\n",
            "[00:17:17,050 --> 00:17:21,050]  So we will continue to deploy more 5G stations\n",
            "[00:17:21,050 --> 00:17:28,050]  and we are looking at to have around 9,000 or so before the fourth quarter.\n",
            "[00:17:28,050 --> 00:17:34,340]  And then so our network coverage nationwide will go from 70-plus percent\n",
            "[00:17:34,340 --> 00:17:38,340]  to 90-plus percent in fourth quarter.\n",
            "[00:17:38,340 --> 00:17:42,340]  And then we will accelerate our 5G adoption or penetration\n",
            "[00:17:42,340 --> 00:17:45,340]  and we will promote our 5G news services.\n",
            "[00:17:45,340 --> 00:17:50,340]  We are making some differences and some changes in our current offers.\n",
            "[00:17:50,340 --> 00:17:56,340]  So we already are seeing very encouraging increase of our daily sales\n",
            "[00:17:56,340 --> 00:18:00,340]  in terms of the 5G sign-up, very encouraging.\n",
            "[00:18:00,340 --> 00:18:06,340]  And then we will grow our new business in smart city, smart manufacturing,\n",
            "[00:18:06,340 --> 00:18:08,340]  and smart telemedicine area.\n",
            "[00:18:08,340 --> 00:18:14,820]  That's our major areas in the new economy and that will make good use of our 5G\n",
            "[00:18:14,820 --> 00:18:21,820]  and also our IoT solutions and also the AI and the big data,\n",
            "[00:18:21,820 --> 00:18:25,820]  which are the main areas that we have been focusing on.\n",
            "[00:18:25,820 --> 00:18:32,820]  And also we are awaiting the Fairtrade community's approval for our joint effort\n",
            "[00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:37,820]  with APT Telecom for the 3.5G spectrum sharing.\n",
            "[00:18:37,820 --> 00:18:44,820]  We already got approval from NCC, so we are awaiting for this Fairtrade community's approval.\n",
            "[00:18:44,820 --> 00:18:50,820]  They are collecting information as we speak and then hopefully soon\n",
            "[00:18:50,820 --> 00:18:53,820]  they will start a formal review.\n",
            "[00:18:53,820 --> 00:19:00,820]  And then we should hear in a couple months for their final read on this.\n",
            "[00:19:00,820 --> 00:19:04,820]  And then we will continue to drive down our operations costs\n",
            "[00:19:04,820 --> 00:19:08,820]  and, of course, we will continue to improve our customer satisfaction.\n",
            "[00:19:08,820 --> 00:19:14,820]  And then by use of our mobile circle, we will continue to offer more services\n",
            "[00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:16,820]  that is to our consumers' liking.\n",
            "[00:19:16,820 --> 00:19:22,820]  And then we do some segmentation analysis and then do personalized recommendations\n",
            "[00:19:22,820 --> 00:19:26,820]  using AI and then that will help us improve.\n",
            "[00:19:26,820 --> 00:19:30,820]  So for every customer that will log in or sign in to the mobile circle,\n",
            "[00:19:30,820 --> 00:19:32,820]  they will have different experience.\n",
            "[00:19:32,820 --> 00:19:36,820]  And then whatever information we push out to them will be more helpful to them\n",
            "[00:19:36,820 --> 00:19:39,820]  than just a plain app.\n",
            "[00:19:39,820 --> 00:19:44,820]  And then also what's coming soon is our annual shareholders meeting\n",
            "[00:19:44,820 --> 00:19:47,820]  that will be held on June 23, 2021.\n",

            "[00:20:20,620 --> 00:20:27,980]  The first to ask question is Neil Dennison, HSBC.\n",
            "[00:20:27,980 --> 00:20:28,980]  Go ahead, please.\n",
            "[00:20:28,980 --> 00:20:31,900]  Hi there. Thank you. Good afternoon.\n",
            "[00:20:31,900 --> 00:20:33,900]  I have two questions, please.\n",
            "[00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:39,900]  The first one relates to the 5G, in particular the postpaid return to growth,\n",
            "[00:20:39,900 --> 00:20:43,900]  which I think you said happened about three months earlier than planned.\n",
            "[00:20:43,900 --> 00:20:51,190]  So what I'd like to ask is what has changed since you made that estimate?\n",
            "[00:20:51,190 --> 00:20:53,190]  Is it faster adoption of 5G?\n",
            "[00:20:53,190 --> 00:21:00,220]  And how does that affect your revenue and EBITDA for the remainder of the year?\n",
            "[00:21:00,220 --> 00:21:05,220]  You said that EBITDA is a little bit lower on a higher bundle plan.\n",
            "[00:21:05,220 --> 00:21:10,220]  Presumably the year-on-year comps get a bit easier because of the roaming\n",
            "[00:21:10,220 --> 00:21:12,220]  in the second, third, and fourth quarters.\n",
            "[00:21:12,220 --> 00:21:15,220]  So that's the first question, just trying to understand that.\n",
            "[00:21:15,220 --> 00:21:19,690]  Okay. I got a first question.\n",
            "[00:21:19,690 --> 00:21:22,300]  What was the second?\n",
            "[00:21:22,300 --> 00:21:29,300]  The second question is on the roaming, sorry, the spectrum sharing deal, APT.\n",
            "[00:21:29,300 --> 00:21:34,300]  So my question is whether you expected it to take this long\n",
            "[00:21:34,300 --> 00:21:37,300]  to get the Fair Trade Committee's approval.\n",
            "[00:21:37,300 --> 00:21:40,300]  And assuming that approval does come through,\n",
            "[00:21:40,300 --> 00:21:44,300]  does that mean you can start to work with APT immediately?\n",
            "[00:21:44,300 --> 00:21:48,300]  Or are there things that you and APT need to set up\n",
            "[00:21:48,300 --> 00:21:53,300]  so there will be a little bit of a time delay before you actually implement that?\n",
            "[00:21:53,300 --> 00:21:55,300]  Okay. I got it.\n",
            "[00:21:55,300 --> 00:21:58,300]  All right. Thank you for clarifying your question.\n",
            "[00:21:58,300 --> 00:22:00,300]  Sure. So for the number one question,\n",
            "[00:22:00,300 --> 00:22:04,300]  the one that we said we are three months ahead of our own projection,\n",
            "[00:22:04,300 --> 00:22:06,300]  is the blended R pool.\n",
            "[00:22:06,300 --> 00:22:10,300]  And then so, well, first of all, when we do the initial projection,\n",
            "[00:22:10,300 --> 00:22:12,300]  we tend to be more conservative.\n",
            "[00:22:12,300 --> 00:22:18,300]  But then secondly, we do see, so in terms of the bundle rate, right,\n",
            "[00:22:18,300 --> 00:22:20,300]  so we have more bundled sales.\n",
            "[00:22:20,300 --> 00:22:25,300]  And also the percentage of users that sign up for the higher rate plan,\n",
            "[00:22:26,300 --> 00:22:30,300]  that is also better than our initial estimate.\n",
            "[00:22:30,300 --> 00:22:35,300]  So, you know, these contribute to the better outcome\n",
            "[00:22:35,300 --> 00:22:38,300]  or the sooner than we expected.\n",
            "[00:22:38,300 --> 00:22:40,300]  Okay. Now that is the first question.\n",
            "[00:22:40,300 --> 00:22:42,300]  And for the second question,\n",
            "[00:22:42,300 --> 00:22:48,300]  so according to the policy for the Fair Trade Committee,\n",
            "[00:22:48,300 --> 00:22:52,300]  once they enter, they start an official review of the case,\n",
            "[00:22:52,300 --> 00:22:55,300]  they have like two months is their KPI.\n",
            "[00:22:55,300 --> 00:22:58,300]  So they need to kind of close the case\n",
            "[00:22:58,300 --> 00:23:02,300]  and then provide a ruling or their recommendation\n",
            "[00:23:02,300 --> 00:23:05,300]  before the end of two months.\n",
            "[00:23:05,300 --> 00:23:07,300]  So they have two months to do that.\n",
            "[00:23:07,300 --> 00:23:12,300]  So that's why I was saying I hope they will start the official review soon.\n",
            "[00:23:12,300 --> 00:23:14,300]  Once they feel they have got enough information,\n",
            "[00:23:14,300 --> 00:23:17,300]  they have a, before the committee reviews it,\n",
            "[00:23:17,300 --> 00:23:21,300]  there are, of course, a working staff that is previewing the documents\n",
            "[00:23:21,300 --> 00:23:24,300]  that we send and then say, well, maybe you send this and that.\n",
            "[00:23:24,300 --> 00:23:26,300]  So this is what they are doing.\n",
            "[00:23:26,300 --> 00:23:29,300]  And then we have provided what they recently asked for\n",
            "[00:23:29,300 --> 00:23:30,300]  and we haven't heard from them.\n",
            "[00:23:30,300 --> 00:23:34,300]  And so hopefully they will start a process soon, if not already.\n",
            "[00:23:34,300 --> 00:23:37,300]  And so from that point on, it should be at most two months\n",
            "[00:23:37,300 --> 00:23:39,300]  and we will hear from them.\n",
            "[00:23:39,300 --> 00:23:43,300]  And to your question, once we hear them, so we didn't just wait.\n",
            "[00:23:43,300 --> 00:23:46,300]  So we already, the network team from two companies,\n",
            "[00:23:46,300 --> 00:23:50,300]  have been experimenting, actually doing the construction\n",
            "[00:23:50,300 --> 00:23:53,300]  and getting where things need to be connected.\n",
            "[00:23:53,300 --> 00:24:01,300]  We already have more than 200 stations where the connection is already done.\n",
            "[00:24:01,300 --> 00:24:03,300]  So they are like a standing by.\n",
            "[00:24:03,300 --> 00:24:09,300]  So once we get official approval, we can just turn it on overnight.\n",
            "[00:24:09,300 --> 00:24:11,300]  So it is vacuum.\n",
            "[00:24:11,300 --> 00:24:15,300]  So there is no further delay than we get some work started.\n",
            "[00:24:15,300 --> 00:24:17,300]  No, we are already ready.\n",
            "[00:24:17,300 --> 00:24:19,300]  We are ready for this to start.\n",
            "[00:24:19,300 --> 00:24:24,300]  But then, of course, you know, there is some service,\n",
            "[00:24:24,300 --> 00:24:30,300]  the APT team may need a few days to get their services, whatever,\n",
            "[00:24:30,300 --> 00:24:32,300]  but I cannot really speak for them.\n",
            "[00:24:32,300 --> 00:24:35,300]  But then in terms of network readiness, we are ready for that.\n",
            "[00:24:35,300 --> 00:24:38,100]  It can be turned on.\n",
            "[00:24:38,100 --> 00:24:39,100]  Okay?\n",
            "[00:24:39,100 --> 00:24:41,100]  Did that answer your question?\n",
            "[00:24:41,100 --> 00:24:42,100]  Yes.\n",
            "[00:24:42,100 --> 00:24:45,100]  Yes, sorry, just to clarify on the first one.\n",
            "[00:24:45,100 --> 00:24:48,100]  So the EBITDA or the profit implication,\n",
            "[00:24:48,100 --> 00:24:53,100]  so you are selling more higher value plans than expected,\n",
            "[00:24:53,100 --> 00:24:57,100]  which is great for profitability over the life of the contract.\n",
            "[00:24:57,100 --> 00:25:02,100]  But in terms of timing, does that imply a little bit more near-term weakness,\n",
            "[00:25:02,100 --> 00:25:05,100]  or not weakness, but pressure on EBITDA?\n",
            "[00:25:05,100 --> 00:25:09,430]  The timing.\n",
            "[00:25:10,460 --> 00:25:22,780]  Well, I guess so the fact that I think in terms of the competition or the market,\n",
            "[00:25:22,780 --> 00:25:25,780]  market so far has been reasonable.\n",
            "[00:25:25,780 --> 00:25:28,780]  So I think that also helps.\n",
            "[00:25:28,780 --> 00:25:34,780]  And then because 5G was so new, so I have to say when my team,\n",
            "[00:25:34,780 --> 00:25:38,780]  they were doing the projection and my CFO was giving me the projection,\n",
            "[00:25:38,780 --> 00:25:41,780]  they usually want to end lower.\n",
            "[00:25:41,780 --> 00:25:44,780]  So tell me like a third quarter, right?\n",
            "[00:25:44,780 --> 00:25:46,780]  But I would push for more.\n",
            "[00:25:46,780 --> 00:25:54,780]  But then as it turned out, we do actually do better than we initially have planned for.\n",
            "[00:25:54,780 --> 00:26:00,810]  So I think the market being not crazy, that certainly helps.\n",
            "[00:26:00,810 --> 00:26:01,810]  Got it.\n",
            "[00:26:01,810 --> 00:26:03,540]  Thanks very much.\n",
            "[00:26:03,540 --> 00:26:06,110]  Sure.\n",
            "[00:26:06,110 --> 00:26:09,110]  And next we'll have Sarah Warren of Morgan Stanley for questions.\n",
            "[00:26:09,110 --> 00:26:10,850]  Go ahead, please.\n",
            "[00:26:10,850 --> 00:26:13,850]  Thank you for the opportunity to ask questions.\n",
            "[00:26:13,850 --> 00:26:15,850]  So I have three questions.\n",
            "[00:26:15,850 --> 00:26:19,850]  So the first one is on fourth quarter results.\n",
            "[00:26:19,850 --> 00:26:22,850]  So it beats the guidance.\n",
            "[00:26:22,850 --> 00:26:26,880]  So would management please share like what's the surprise?\n",
            "[00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:28,880]  Is that mainly from the 5G,\n",
            "[00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:33,880]  or we also see some like positive surprise from the ICT side?\n",
            "[00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:36,880]  And then the second question is on the 5G R tool list.\n",
            "[00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:43,880]  Just want to get the definition of more than 20% uplift.\n",
            "[00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:48,880]  So is that apple to apple, meaning the same person like previously like they pay,\n",
            "[00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:54,880]  or the same person they pay 20% more before and after migrate to 5G?\n",
            "[00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:59,880]  And then I recall this number, it's higher than previous say 15%.\n",
            "[00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:04,880]  So is that because like 5G pricing is the same,\n",
            "[00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:09,880]  but we're seeing more lower Apple customers migrating to 5G?\n",
            "[00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:14,880]  And then the third question is that so far,\n",
            "[00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:18,880]  it seems the 5G adoption or uplift in Taiwan is quite encouraging.\n",
            "[00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:23,880]  But given like our 5G network quality seems to be better,\n",
            "[00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:29,880]  download speed better, and also spectrum bandwidth is also more sufficient than peers.\n",
            "[00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:38,880]  So do management see any further upside from the 5G either consumer or enterprise,\n",
            "[00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:47,360]  or do we see any divergence in the 5G performance going forward compared with peers?\n",
            "[00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:49,520]  Okay. Thank you, Sarah.\n",
            "[00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:51,520]  So I think there are three questions.\n",
            "[00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:57,520]  The first is our revenue that is beating our own four targets, right?\n",
            "[00:27:57,520 --> 00:28:07,520]  So yes, this is contributed by our good growth with the new economy.\n",
            "[00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:14,520]  And then on the telecom side, we do see more bundled sales than with the higher rate plan.\n",
            "[00:28:14,520 --> 00:28:21,520]  And then I have to say at the same time because the iPhone, right?\n",
            "[00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:25,520]  So iPhone continues to be very attractive, very popular.\n",
            "[00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:28,520]  And iPhone is higher priced.\n",
            "[00:28:28,520 --> 00:28:33,520]  So if you follow the revenue side, so that does make it look, you know, even better.\n",
            "[00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:40,520]  So for the above the target performance, I would attribute to, you know,\n",
            "[00:28:40,520 --> 00:28:47,520]  both the new economy growth and also the strong bundled sales with 5G.\n",
            "[00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:53,520]  And then, you know, and then iPhone certainly is the choice of the consumers,\n",
            "[00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:56,520]  the major choice of the consumers at the time.\n",
            "[00:28:56,520 --> 00:28:59,520]  And then that helps uplift the revenue as well.\n",
            "[00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:05,520]  Okay. And the second question you were asking about the uplift,\n",
            "[00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:07,520]  and then you were definitely right.\n",
            "[00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:14,520]  And then, yes, so like as we started when we first launched 5G\n",
            "[00:29:14,520 --> 00:29:19,520]  and then our top, you know, tier of users that we want to start attracting,\n",
            "[00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:24,550]  those already are high rate plan because they are less price sensitive\n",
            "[00:29:24,550 --> 00:29:27,550]  or they can ‚Äì their affordability is high.\n",
            "[00:29:27,550 --> 00:29:28,550]  They want to try the new things.\n",
            "[00:29:28,550 --> 00:29:31,550]  So they are already on the higher rate plan.\n",
            "[00:29:31,550 --> 00:29:39,550]  So when they change to the 1399, the uplift is ‚Äì there is uplift, but then still not as much.\n",
            "[00:29:39,550 --> 00:29:45,550]  But then as we finish with that tier, that batch, right, and you go down to the next tier,\n",
            "[00:29:45,550 --> 00:29:51,550]  and then so, yes, you have more consumer with a lower rate plan currently.\n",
            "[00:29:51,550 --> 00:29:56,550]  And then once you are successfully moving them or upgrading them to 5G,\n",
            "[00:29:56,550 --> 00:29:58,550]  then you see a bigger, you know, uplift.\n",
            "[00:29:58,550 --> 00:30:00,550]  So you are definitely right there.\n",
            "[00:30:00,550 --> 00:30:04,550]  And then the way to calculate it, and you were also right,\n",
            "[00:30:04,550 --> 00:30:08,550]  so this is the bunch of renewed customers.\n",
            "[00:30:08,550 --> 00:30:12,550]  And before 5G, and then their current rate was so much,\n",
            "[00:30:12,550 --> 00:30:18,550]  the average rate plan for the monthly fee for this bunch of renewed customers is so much.\n",
            "[00:30:18,550 --> 00:30:21,550]  And then after this, you know, upgrade, and then what's the ‚Äì\n",
            "[00:30:21,550 --> 00:30:27,550]  for the same set of customers and what's the same ‚Äì the new average of monthly fee.\n",
            "[00:30:27,550 --> 00:30:29,550]  So the difference is the uplift.\n",
            "[00:30:29,550 --> 00:30:30,550]  That's how we calculate it.\n",
            "[00:30:32,670 --> 00:30:38,670]  And then the third, I think you were asking, since we are ‚Äì we have very good high premium,\n",
            "[00:30:38,670 --> 00:30:42,670]  you know, network, and then we do good optimization,\n",
            "[00:30:42,670 --> 00:30:47,670]  and we did a lot of, you know, technology-oriented optimization.\n",
            "[00:30:47,670 --> 00:30:53,670]  We used AI big data to make our network very efficient and then also best performance.\n",
            "[00:30:53,670 --> 00:30:59,670]  And then we do see that as an advantage in our attracting the consumers, right?\n",
            "[00:31:00,670 --> 00:31:02,670]  So ‚Äì and then, you know, you saw ‚Äì\n",
            "[00:31:06,670 --> 00:31:09,670]  like I said, like I was saying, you know, we actually ‚Äì\n",
            "[00:31:09,670 --> 00:31:15,670]  half of the takers of the package, you know, were new customers.\n",
            "[00:31:15,670 --> 00:31:19,670]  And then I believe not because of the religious event itself\n",
            "[00:31:19,670 --> 00:31:22,670]  and the offer itself is very innovative.\n",
            "[00:31:22,670 --> 00:31:26,670]  We actually took the same, you know, to the incense burner.\n",
            "[00:31:26,670 --> 00:31:28,670]  And then so that is like a bless, right?\n",
            "[00:31:28,670 --> 00:31:30,670]  That has been blessed.\n",
            "[00:31:30,670 --> 00:31:31,670]  And then that is the package.\n",
            "[00:31:31,670 --> 00:31:34,670]  So we only have like a limited edition for that.\n",
            "[00:31:34,670 --> 00:31:41,670]  But then the new customers that we were able to get, they were not FET customers.\n",
            "[00:31:41,670 --> 00:31:48,670]  If we did not have already a good reputation with our, you know, premium quality of our network,\n",
            "[00:31:48,670 --> 00:31:51,670]  we wouldn't be able to do just that.\n",
            "[00:31:52,670 --> 00:31:59,670]  So definitely the quality of network, as we see in a lot of the marketing analysis or the user insight,\n",
            "[00:31:59,670 --> 00:32:05,670]  network is one of the most, if not the most, the most important factors\n",
            "[00:32:05,670 --> 00:32:09,670]  in terms of determining the consumer's choices.\n",
            "[00:32:09,670 --> 00:32:12,670]  So the quality of network definitely is very important.\n",
            "[00:32:12,670 --> 00:32:14,670]  So we do see that as our advantage.\n",
            "[00:32:15,670 --> 00:32:21,670]  And we are riding on that momentum as we have won this, you know, number one 5G network\n",
            "[00:32:21,670 --> 00:32:24,670]  two times in a row again, right?\n",
            "[00:32:24,670 --> 00:32:27,670]  And so we are working really hard.\n",
            "[00:32:27,670 --> 00:32:32,670]  And then on the enterprise side, you know, the 5G quality and then the coverage,\n",
            "[00:32:32,670 --> 00:32:37,670]  both are very important to provide, you know, reliable 5G service for industry,\n",
            "[00:32:37,670 --> 00:32:43,670]  whether that is a telemedicine or that is for private network, you know, 5G network.\n",
            "[00:32:43,670 --> 00:32:46,670]  The quality of the network does matter.\n",
            "[00:32:46,670 --> 00:32:53,670]  And as we will see more applications, consumer applications that will be available on our cell phones,\n",
            "[00:32:53,670 --> 00:32:59,670]  people will, consumer will really see it is necessary to have a 5G, you know, service\n",
            "[00:32:59,670 --> 00:33:04,670]  because otherwise your other new applications will be compromised.\n",
            "[00:33:04,670 --> 00:33:06,670]  Your experience will be compromised.\n",
            "[00:33:06,670 --> 00:33:10,670]  So we do see that, you know, our advantage with how we build the network\n",
            "[00:33:10,670 --> 00:33:12,670]  and the investment we made in our network\n",
            "[00:33:12,670 --> 00:33:17,670]  and our NT team's diligence and their innovation in this area,\n",
            "[00:33:17,670 --> 00:33:21,670]  that will continue to be a driving force for us to do.\n",
            "[00:33:21,670 --> 00:33:26,930]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:33:26,930 --> 00:33:29,930]  Just two quick follow-up questions.\n",
            "[00:33:29,930 --> 00:33:35,930]  So first, on the 5G consumer sentiment or momentum we saw recently,\n",
            "[00:33:35,930 --> 00:33:40,930]  so do you think our pool will even further widen going forward,\n",
            "[00:33:40,930 --> 00:33:46,930]  meaning like are we seeing consumers willing to pay for the high-speed 5G services\n",
            "[00:33:46,930 --> 00:33:51,930]  or like actually some of them still think the pricing is quite expensive\n",
            "[00:33:51,930 --> 00:33:55,930]  and then we expect our pool will be relatively stable,\n",
            "[00:33:55,930 --> 00:34:01,930]  at least targeting the same pricing tier customers for some period of time going forward.\n",
            "[00:34:01,930 --> 00:34:05,930]  And then the second question is on the 5G enterprise side.\n",
            "[00:34:06,930 --> 00:34:10,930]  So you've mentioned there's several applications, smart cities,\n",
            "[00:34:10,930 --> 00:34:12,930]  smart manufacturers, smart telemedicine.\n",
            "[00:34:12,930 --> 00:34:19,930]  So are these customers mostly public sector customers or private sector customers\n",
            "[00:34:19,930 --> 00:34:25,930]  and then do we see any early business model basically how we charge them\n",
            "[00:34:25,930 --> 00:34:29,930]  and also like, for example, in business guidance,\n",
            "[00:34:29,930 --> 00:34:35,930]  how we take that into account, say incremental revenue contribution\n",
            "[00:34:35,930 --> 00:34:39,730]  from the 5G enterprise application?\n",
            "[00:34:39,730 --> 00:34:40,730]  Okay.\n",
            "[00:34:40,730 --> 00:34:42,270]  All right.\n",
            "[00:34:42,270 --> 00:34:44,560]  So the first question is about our pool, right?\n",
            "[00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:46,560]  So our pool is an average.\n",
            "[00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:52,910]  So the more customers upgraded to 5G with more uplifts and then, of course,\n",
            "[00:34:52,910 --> 00:34:55,910]  this our pool will only be getting better and better.\n",
            "[00:34:55,910 --> 00:34:59,910]  And then so that will be continuing to improve.\n",
            "[00:34:59,910 --> 00:35:05,910]  And then we already have more than 10% of penetration for the post-paid subscribers\n",
            "[00:35:05,910 --> 00:35:12,910]  and then that is with the recent boost I'm seeing.\n",
            "[00:35:12,910 --> 00:35:17,910]  I think very soon this percentage will increase very soon.\n",
            "[00:35:17,910 --> 00:35:22,910]  So that will only help our pool even more just because how our pool,\n",
            "[00:35:22,910 --> 00:35:27,030]  you know, we are kind of changing the pool, right?\n",
            "[00:35:28,030 --> 00:35:33,030]  You ship more 4G consumers to 5G with the higher rate plans\n",
            "[00:35:33,030 --> 00:35:36,030]  and this will just help our pool totally.\n",
            "[00:35:36,030 --> 00:35:40,030]  And also, on the other hand, because the 4G network is congested,\n",
            "[00:35:40,030 --> 00:35:45,030]  that's why I said when the consumers say, well, you know, I have 4G phone,\n",
            "[00:35:45,030 --> 00:35:46,030]  that is already enough.\n",
            "[00:35:46,030 --> 00:35:47,030]  I say, well, enough for them.\n",
            "[00:35:47,030 --> 00:35:52,030]  But then for us, the carriers, I believe for my peers, that's also the case.\n",
            "[00:35:52,030 --> 00:35:59,030]  In order for us to continue to, you know, maintain good quality of the network experience,\n",
            "[00:35:59,030 --> 00:36:04,030]  we have to continue to invest if our users stay on 4G network.\n",
            "[00:36:04,030 --> 00:36:08,030]  But then since now we have built 5G network and then, you know,\n",
            "[00:36:08,030 --> 00:36:13,030]  with more than 70% coverage, you know, very soon, before the end of the year,\n",
            "[00:36:13,030 --> 00:36:14,030]  it's going to be 90%.\n",
            "[00:36:14,030 --> 00:36:21,030]  So there's no reason why we wouldn't better utilize our 5G network for more users\n",
            "[00:36:21,030 --> 00:36:26,030]  to upgrade to 5G and that will help relieve the congestion on 4G as well.\n",
            "[00:36:26,030 --> 00:36:29,030]  So that is a win-win situation.\n",
            "[00:36:29,030 --> 00:36:32,030]  So we need to look at it both ways.\n",
            "[00:36:32,030 --> 00:36:37,030]  And then so, you know, moving more 4G users to 5G is a good thing.\n",
            "[00:36:37,030 --> 00:36:40,030]  And the users will definitely have better experience as well.\n",
            "[00:36:40,030 --> 00:36:45,030]  We actually see from our third-party survey for our customers,\n",
            "[00:36:45,030 --> 00:36:50,030]  the customer satisfaction score for those that we surveyed of 5G users,\n",
            "[00:36:50,030 --> 00:36:54,030]  the average satisfaction actually is higher than the 4G users.\n",
            "[00:36:54,030 --> 00:36:56,030]  It is just a fact.\n",
            "[00:36:56,030 --> 00:37:00,030]  So 5G is better, you know, if people only have the chance to use that.\n",
            "[00:37:00,030 --> 00:37:05,030]  And we will have more creative offers and to encourage people to try.\n",
            "[00:37:05,030 --> 00:37:12,760]  And then I think you were asking about models, right, kind of like, you know, for the enterprise.\n",
            "[00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:20,760]  Yeah, so, well, first of all, for the smart manufacturing, that is mostly, mainly,\n",
            "[00:37:20,760 --> 00:37:27,760]  you know, private sector, but then when it's smart city and then a lot of, if not all of it,\n",
            "[00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:36,760]  I should say smart city in most cases, if not all of it, is from the government, right?\n",
            "[00:37:36,760 --> 00:37:39,760]  So whether it's a central government or local government,\n",
            "[00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:47,760]  they have the funding to fund various projects that is smart city related or smart government.\n",
            "[00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:51,760]  You know, we actually have some government agencies doing some big data\n",
            "[00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:56,760]  and then needing some data platforms, you know, those kinds of projects.\n",
            "[00:37:56,760 --> 00:37:58,790]  And we got those as well.\n",
            "[00:37:58,790 --> 00:38:03,790]  So, and then telemedicine is a combination because, you know,\n",
            "[00:38:04,790 --> 00:38:11,790]  medical area is also restricted, right, or is heavily regulated.\n",
            "[00:38:11,790 --> 00:38:18,790]  So the government will have the policy on the insurance, on the reimbursement, things like that.\n",
            "[00:38:18,790 --> 00:38:25,790]  And then they set the regulation, they set the policy, like all suburb areas will need to have,\n",
            "[00:38:25,790 --> 00:38:31,790]  for those, you know, the underprivileged residents and all that.\n",
            "[00:38:31,790 --> 00:38:35,790]  They need to have same access to the medical resources.\n",
            "[00:38:35,790 --> 00:38:40,790]  So they have this program that for all the, like, 400 or so,\n",
            "[00:38:40,790 --> 00:38:49,790]  they identified the counties that they will be given this kind of 5G telemedicine service, right?\n",
            "[00:38:49,790 --> 00:38:52,790]  So that is really the government's doing.\n",
            "[00:38:52,790 --> 00:38:56,790]  And also, you know, part of it is also for the hospitals, right,\n",
            "[00:38:56,790 --> 00:39:00,790]  for the hospitals to participate in these telemedicine programs,\n",
            "[00:39:00,790 --> 00:39:04,790]  they need to be able to use some kind of communication program.\n",
            "[00:39:04,790 --> 00:39:06,790]  And that's what we provide.\n",
            "[00:39:06,790 --> 00:39:14,790]  So we actually at BET have the telemedicine communication platform that we built, you know, with our software.\n",
            "[00:39:14,790 --> 00:39:22,790]  And then, so the remote doctors in the far end hospital, in the urban hospitals,\n",
            "[00:39:22,790 --> 00:39:28,790]  and also the local health centers' medical personnel, and then also the patients, right,\n",
            "[00:39:28,790 --> 00:39:34,790]  they can all combine and then communicate on the platform, upload the image, you know,\n",
            "[00:39:34,790 --> 00:39:42,790]  that is taken from the local health center for the patients with the telescope, right?\n",
            "[00:39:42,790 --> 00:39:46,790]  So those kind of images upload through this communication.\n",
            "[00:39:46,790 --> 00:39:49,790]  And when the far end doctor can see it right away, right,\n",
            "[00:39:49,790 --> 00:39:52,790]  and then just as if they see the patient in person.\n",
            "[00:39:52,790 --> 00:39:57,790]  So those kind of communication capabilities, real-time, no latency,\n",
            "[00:39:57,790 --> 00:40:01,790]  and then the good resolution to see these things clearly,\n",
            "[00:40:01,790 --> 00:40:05,790]  and those are the capabilities we provide as part of the telemedicine service.\n",
            "[00:40:05,790 --> 00:40:12,790]  And then, so in terms of pricing, you know, or where we actually would make our money, right?\n",
            "[00:40:12,790 --> 00:40:16,790]  So if you think about it, first you need to deploy the 5G,\n",
            "[00:40:16,790 --> 00:40:19,790]  and there is some infrastructure you have to, you know, build.\n",
            "[00:40:19,790 --> 00:40:22,790]  And some of them we use part of our macro network.\n",
            "[00:40:22,790 --> 00:40:25,790]  But still, for the, you know, specific health center,\n",
            "[00:40:25,790 --> 00:40:29,790]  we may still need to provide some telecommunication infrastructure.\n",
            "[00:40:29,790 --> 00:40:35,790]  So there is some initial construction, you know, service fees or, you know, that we may get.\n",
            "[00:40:35,790 --> 00:40:41,790]  And then in terms of the telecommunication or the communication program,\n",
            "[00:40:41,790 --> 00:40:46,790]  the software that we build or the platform, we do the license.\n",
            "[00:40:46,790 --> 00:40:52,790]  So you can do the license by the hospital, you know, like it's an MA kind of thing, you know,\n",
            "[00:40:52,790 --> 00:40:56,790]  unlimited use, or it's a per license, per doctor.\n",
            "[00:40:56,790 --> 00:41:00,790]  And then so we have different kind of models that are being worked.\n",
            "[00:41:00,790 --> 00:41:06,790]  And then since this is the beginning, and then eventually when the telemedicine service\n",
            "[00:41:06,790 --> 00:41:12,790]  is also granted for urban folks, then we can charge the patients with some convenience\n",
            "[00:41:12,790 --> 00:41:15,790]  by using the application we provide.\n",
            "[00:41:15,790 --> 00:41:23,790]  So there are actually quite a bit of different opportunities where we see the monetization is feasible,\n",
            "[00:41:23,790 --> 00:41:29,270]  not to mention the kind of CSR benefit this service will provide.\n",
            "[00:41:29,270 --> 00:41:35,270]  And then for smart manufacturing, so this is the initial construction,\n",
            "[00:41:35,270 --> 00:41:37,270]  because it's not just construct.\n",
            "[00:41:37,270 --> 00:41:42,270]  You really have to design a robust network, right, 5G network, the connections,\n",
            "[00:41:42,270 --> 00:41:47,270]  to make sure, you know, what they need to do in the factories or in the different floors,\n",
            "[00:41:47,270 --> 00:41:49,270]  for example, can be all covered.\n",
            "[00:41:49,270 --> 00:41:54,270]  So there's that initial design phase, and then where our team will need to come in.\n",
            "[00:41:54,270 --> 00:41:57,270]  So it's kind of like a network planning, network engineering.\n",
            "[00:41:57,270 --> 00:42:00,270]  So there's an initial setup fee.\n",
            "[00:42:00,270 --> 00:42:08,270]  And then once we put our equipment there, you know, usually they will pay us like an OPEX,\n",
            "[00:42:08,270 --> 00:42:14,270]  monthly certificate for paying continue to use the private network.\n",
            "[00:42:14,270 --> 00:42:16,270]  And then there's also the managed service part.\n",
            "[00:42:16,270 --> 00:42:22,270]  If they wanted to manage their private network proactively, you know,\n",
            "[00:42:22,270 --> 00:42:27,270]  instead of just calling us when some hardware crash or whatever.\n",
            "[00:42:27,270 --> 00:42:29,270]  So there's a managed service model as well.\n",
            "[00:42:29,270 --> 00:42:30,270]  So it all varies.\n",
            "[00:42:30,270 --> 00:42:35,270]  But then for each of them, we will work with our clients,\n",
            "[00:42:35,270 --> 00:42:38,270]  and we have very flexible, you know, pricing committee.\n",
            "[00:42:38,270 --> 00:42:41,270]  And then we will see, you know, what a user's needs are.\n",
            "[00:42:41,270 --> 00:42:45,270]  And this is all new, and then we are also learning what may be a better model\n",
            "[00:42:45,270 --> 00:42:50,270]  that works better for some kind of customers in some vertical versus the other.\n",
            "[00:42:50,270 --> 00:42:56,270]  But then we have actually pricing committee forms just for the 5G private network\n",
            "[00:42:56,270 --> 00:42:58,270]  as we were deploying this.\n",
            "[00:42:58,270 --> 00:43:02,270]  So we have that foresight, seeing this is new, and we are learning it,\n",
            "[00:43:02,270 --> 00:43:04,270]  and we want to be agile.\n",
            "[00:43:04,270 --> 00:43:09,270]  So we put a pricing committee together so this won't take long when we interact with our clients.\n",
            "[00:43:09,270 --> 00:43:14,580]  But that's kind of like a ‚Äì so in summary, Sarah, you know,\n",
            "[00:43:14,580 --> 00:43:21,580]  the pricing for these smart, you know, industries, different kind of services, it all varies.\n",
            "[00:43:21,580 --> 00:43:26,580]  But in the probably next question, you're going to ask me, what about the margin?\n",
            "[00:43:27,580 --> 00:43:29,580]  The margin varies too, right?\n",
            "[00:43:29,580 --> 00:43:31,580]  Margin varies too.\n",
            "[00:43:31,580 --> 00:43:34,900]  And then it all depends.\n",
            "[00:43:34,900 --> 00:43:35,900]  Got it.\n",
            "[00:43:35,900 --> 00:43:36,900]  That's really comprehensive.\n",
            "[00:43:36,900 --> 00:43:38,930]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:43:38,930 --> 00:43:41,750]  Okay.\n",
            "[00:43:41,750 --> 00:43:43,750]  We're now in question and answer session.\n",
            "[00:43:43,750 --> 00:43:47,750]  If you would like to ask a question, please press 01 on your telephone keypad.\n",

            "[00:44:37,800 --> 00:44:40,800]  There are currently no questions at this point.\n",
            "[00:44:40,800 --> 00:44:42,800]  And then I'll pass the call back to Mr. Gary White.\n",
            "[00:44:42,800 --> 00:44:44,800]  And, Gary, please proceed.\n",
            "[00:44:44,800 --> 00:44:46,020]  And Chief.\n",
            "[00:44:46,020 --> 00:44:47,020]  Okay.\n",
            "[00:44:47,020 --> 00:44:51,250]  And I have just like a departing remark for our audience here.\n",
            "[00:44:51,250 --> 00:45:00,250]  As we said in our last IR call, when we announced our dividends, that will be still 3.25.\n",
            "[00:45:00,250 --> 00:45:05,340]  And then we said because we see that we believe we have hit the bottom, right?\n",
            "[00:45:05,340 --> 00:45:07,340]  I think the worst has passed.\n",
            "[00:45:07,340 --> 00:45:11,340]  And the first quarter performance certainly is reassuring.\n",
            "[00:45:11,340 --> 00:45:16,340]  And then we believe that we will continue to do good, to do well.\n",
            "[00:45:16,340 --> 00:45:21,340]  And then, you know, looking for a strong year ahead of us.\n",
            "[00:45:21,340 --> 00:45:24,340]  For what we have seen so far, it is very encouraging.\n",
            "[00:45:24,340 --> 00:45:26,340]  And thank you for your support.\n",
            "[00:45:26,340 --> 00:45:32,340]  And if there are questions you didn't get a chance to ask, our IR team is always standing by, you know,\n",
            "[00:45:32,340 --> 00:45:34,340]  and feel free to reach out to them or myself.\n",

            "[00:01:09,670 --> 00:01:14,670]  So I would just like before I will update you on our mobile market in Taiwan,\n",
            "[00:01:14,670 --> 00:01:16,670]  which you probably are already familiar with.\n",
            "[00:01:16,670 --> 00:01:18,670]  That is, it is a saturated market.\n",
            "[00:01:18,670 --> 00:01:22,670]  And if you look at the total subscriber's number, it's about flat,\n",
            "[00:01:22,670 --> 00:01:27,670]  and then a little bit up in the fourth quarter for $29.3 million.\n",
            "[00:01:27,670 --> 00:01:32,670]  And then on the right-hand side is the mobile number of portability customers.\n",
            "[00:01:32,670 --> 00:01:37,670]  So the market has been very cold, and then the pandemic certainly did not help.\n",
            "[00:01:37,670 --> 00:01:40,670]  So the third quarter, even though we launched 5G,\n",
            "[00:01:40,670 --> 00:01:45,670]  but then at that time there were only a couple or three 5G devices available.\n",
            "[00:01:45,670 --> 00:01:50,670]  And I think many people were waiting for iPhone to launch.\n",
            "[00:01:50,670 --> 00:01:55,670]  So you can see from the chart here, the third quarter is the lowest.\n",
            "[00:01:55,670 --> 00:02:01,670]  So it has only 482,000 people available on the market.\n",
            "[00:02:01,670 --> 00:02:07,670]  And then in the fourth quarter, thanks to iPhone's launch or release, it did come up a little bit.\n",
            "[00:02:07,670 --> 00:02:11,670]  But still, if you look at the previous data, that is still relatively cold.\n",
            "[00:02:12,670 --> 00:02:13,670]  All right.\n",
            "[00:02:13,670 --> 00:02:20,670]  And then in terms of FET's own mobile service performance, we are happy to report that\n",
            "[00:02:20,670 --> 00:02:24,670]  we have continued to grow the post-pay customers,\n",
            "[00:02:24,670 --> 00:02:29,670]  even though the market is already very saturated and the MP market is very cold.\n",
            "[00:02:29,670 --> 00:02:34,670]  But we still manage to continue to grow our base of subscribers.\n",
            "[00:02:34,670 --> 00:02:39,670]  And then in terms of the churn rate, we keep hitting the record low for ourselves.\n",
            "[00:02:39,670 --> 00:02:43,670]  And then in January, it's 1%.\n",
            "[00:02:43,670 --> 00:02:49,900]  And then for our pool, we continue to lead our peers in terms of the both blended,\n",
            "[00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:52,900]  our pool and also post-pay.\n",
            "[00:02:52,900 --> 00:03:02,420]  And on the next page, in terms of our 5G update, 5G certainly is a good thing for telcos.\n",
            "[00:03:02,420 --> 00:03:06,420]  I think it is a new chapter.\n",
            "[00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:14,420]  So far, we are very encouraged with the steady and then strong 5G adoption that we continue to see.\n",
            "[00:03:14,420 --> 00:03:20,420]  And also, most importantly, 95% of these 5G customers, they sign up for our higher rate plan,\n",
            "[00:03:20,420 --> 00:03:26,420]  which is $999 and above, like a $1,399.\n",
            "[00:03:26,420 --> 00:03:32,420]  And then the average monthly fee for our renewal customers, before and after,\n",
            "[00:03:32,420 --> 00:03:36,420]  it has shown more than 15% uplift.\n",
            "[00:03:36,420 --> 00:03:44,520]  And then that uplift actually continues to get bigger as we go.\n",
            "[00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:51,520]  And also, so far, 4,600 5G stations have been deployed,\n",
            "[00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:56,520]  and they cover 61% of our population island-wide.\n",
            "[00:03:56,520 --> 00:04:02,520]  And then also, we are going to target 90% of the coverage by the end of the year, 2021.\n",
            "[00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:11,510]  And as you may have heard, Taiwan is ranked number three in terms of our 5G download speed by OpenSignal.\n",
            "[00:04:11,510 --> 00:04:16,510]  And then, of course, I have to say, I think FET has a lot to do with it,\n",
            "[00:04:16,510 --> 00:04:24,510]  because if you look at our download speed, which is 351 versus the 272 average speed for Taiwan,\n",
            "[00:04:24,510 --> 00:04:27,510]  and then we are ranked number one in Taiwan.\n",
            "[00:04:27,510 --> 00:04:33,080]  And that is also the case by Okla's speed test.\n",
            "[00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:40,080]  And then in terms of our new economy performance, as you know, we have started our transformation journey,\n",
            "[00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:44,080]  and we continue to grow our new economy.\n",
            "[00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:53,080]  And then even last year, under the COVID-19, we still managed to grow 13% of our new economy overall.\n",
            "[00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:57,080]  And then in some areas, you know, some do better than the others.\n",
            "[00:04:57,080 --> 00:05:02,080]  On the consumer side, our media services, which includes the text,\n",
            "[00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:09,080]  and also we have some data analytics kind of service as well, that grew 15%.\n",
            "[00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:17,080]  And our e-commerce, although very, very tiny compared with our peers, MOMO, it is still reporting a 23% growth.\n",
            "[00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:25,080]  And then, of course, this is an area we will continue to work on and then continue to grow.\n",
            "[00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:30,080]  And then our direct carrier billing, it shows an 11% growth as well,\n",
            "[00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:35,300]  and we are still the number one in Taiwan for the direct carrier billing.\n",
            "[00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:42,300]  And our monthly active user base has gone up by 20% for the Friday video.\n",
            "[00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:45,300]  That, of course, benefits from the pandemic.\n",
            "[00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:52,300]  People do not have time for it, but then also I have to say we had added many interesting contents,\n",
            "[00:05:52,300 --> 00:06:00,300]  and so we are investing in the content to boost the viewership.\n",
            "[00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:08,040]  And then on the ICT side, that is on the enterprise side, our ICT grew 70% overall.\n",
            "[00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:13,040]  And then for the cloud service, the resale, and then this includes the public cloud resale\n",
            "[00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:19,040]  and also our own private cloud that FET provides in our IDC.\n",
            "[00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:23,040]  Together, it is showing a 68% year-over-year growth.\n",
            "[00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:29,040]  And our IOT area has done very, very well, and it is 57%.\n",
            "[00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:32,040]  And in particular, I would like to point out the telemedicine,\n",
            "[00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:37,040]  which is considered under the IOT category, the umbrella or the family.\n",
            "[00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:45,040]  And I point it out only because this is utilizing 5G, and we kick off this service.\n",
            "[00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:48,040]  We provided this service in Taitung City.\n",
            "[00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:52,040]  And then since then, we have Taitung Province, I should say.\n",
            "[00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:56,040]  And then we have more engagement and work with New Taipei City\n",
            "[00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:59,040]  and then a couple other provinces as well.\n",
            "[00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:06,040]  So we have seen a 34% increase, growth from last year,\n",
            "[00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:11,040]  and then we see even bigger growth for this year, as we projected.\n",
            "[00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:16,040]  So it's a very exciting area, and it really helps the underprivileged folks\n",
            "[00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:18,040]  that are in the far-to-reach areas.\n",
            "[00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:24,040]  So we take pride in us doing this as a pioneer and using our 5G technology.\n",
            "[00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:31,470]  And in the security area, we also grew 29%.\n",
            "[00:07:31,470 --> 00:07:37,470]  And then the last two slides before I turn the stage to the CFO\n",
            "[00:07:37,470 --> 00:07:41,470]  are just a list of awards and recognition that we have received.\n",
            "[00:07:41,470 --> 00:07:46,470]  As you know, FET has very committed to the ESG or the CSR-related work,\n",
            "[00:07:46,470 --> 00:07:49,470]  so we got quite a few awards in that area.\n",
            "[00:07:49,470 --> 00:07:53,470]  And I would also like to turn your attention to the innovation awards,\n",
            "[00:07:53,470 --> 00:07:58,470]  the kind of recognition we got for the advanced ICT work that we did,\n",
            "[00:07:58,470 --> 00:08:03,470]  like the smart city innovation and also our IoT innovation.\n",
            "[00:08:03,470 --> 00:08:07,470]  So that was something in our new economy as our focus.\n",
            "[00:08:07,470 --> 00:08:12,950]  So getting those recognitions was very encouraging and exciting.\n",
            "[00:08:12,950 --> 00:08:18,300]  And then, as usual, we put in a lot of effort in improving our customer service\n",
            "[00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:20,300]  and the customer satisfaction.\n",
            "[00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:25,300]  So in the service awards, we continue to be recognized for our customer service.\n",
            "[00:08:25,300 --> 00:08:28,300]  And then we got Best Service in Taiwan.\n",
            "[00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:31,300]  That's nine years in a row by the Commercial Times.\n",
            "[00:08:31,300 --> 00:08:37,300]  And also we have the Customer Service Excellence Award from PCCDA in 2020.\n",
            "[00:08:37,300 --> 00:08:44,300]  We also have a few of our store managers get recognized as the best store managers in Taiwan\n",
            "[00:08:44,300 --> 00:08:49,300]  and actually get to meet our President Tsai just recently.\n",
            "[00:08:49,300 --> 00:08:54,300]  And then in our enterprise area, we also have some major wins last year.\n",
            "[00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:57,300]  And then over some major collaborations.\n",
            "[00:08:57,300 --> 00:09:05,300]  For example, our millimeter wave private network with our 28G spectrum with MediaTek,\n",
            "[00:09:05,300 --> 00:09:09,300]  which is the world's leading 5G modern design company.\n",
            "[00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:13,300]  And our engagement with Delta and Microsoft in kicking off\n",
            "[00:09:13,300 --> 00:09:17,300]  and actually creating the 5G smart factory.\n",
            "[00:09:17,300 --> 00:09:22,300]  The latest I heard actually in March, they will make it commercially available\n",
            "[00:09:22,300 --> 00:09:24,300]  and then for business and all that.\n",
            "[00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:27,300]  So I'm really excited and looking forward to that.\n",
            "[00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:30,300]  And then the 5G telemedicine, as I mentioned earlier,\n",
            "[00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:34,300]  we operated in new Taipei, Taichung provinces already.\n",
            "[00:09:34,300 --> 00:09:39,300]  And then we have deployed 80,000 smart streetlights at Taoyuan.\n",
            "[00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:45,300]  And then that same work, we got recognized for very good network management.\n",
            "[00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:48,300]  This is about, you know, some of these smart city projects.\n",
            "[00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:51,300]  People think, you know, maybe the telcos only provide connectivity.\n",
            "[00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:52,300]  It's really more than that.\n",
            "[00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:56,300]  Just to manage the availability of these devices, you know,\n",
            "[00:09:56,300 --> 00:10:01,300]  to achieve a 99.99 kind of availability, it takes a lot of work\n",
            "[00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:03,300]  and it takes good network management.\n",
            "[00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:08,300]  So not everybody can do that or not everybody can do it that well.\n",
            "[00:10:08,300 --> 00:10:10,300]  And then we certainly did very well with Taoyuan.\n",
            "[00:10:10,300 --> 00:10:17,300]  That was a good example of our team's demonstrated our capability.\n",
            "[00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:21,400]  And also we deployed smart water meters for Taipei City.\n",
            "[00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:27,400]  So the smart city is definitely an area that FET will continue to work on.\n",
            "[00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:29,400]  We see a lot of opportunities,\n",
            "[00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:32,400]  especially these projects come from the government sector.\n",
            "[00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:35,400]  And we have had many good wins\n",
            "[00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:39,400]  and very good experience working with government agency or local governments\n",
            "[00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:44,100]  because we did good work there.\n",
            "[00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:49,100]  And I will turn that to Sharon for financial performance.\n",
            "[00:10:49,100 --> 00:10:50,100]  Thank you, President Xi.\n",
            "[00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:52,100]  Good afternoon, everyone.\n",

            "[00:11:04,100 --> 00:11:09,100]  With the back-expanding control, the Q4 EBITDA is $6.9 billion,\n",
            "[00:11:09,100 --> 00:11:11,100]  quarter over quarter improved.\n",

            "[00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:37,680]  but then it probably just won't be as bad as last year.\n",
            "[00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:40,680]  So things are, you know, recovering.\n",
            "[00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:51,280]  But then our revenue target, we are still conservatively or questionable.\n",
            "[00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:57,280]  But then on the other hand, we also see the traditional voice on the phone usage\n",
            "[00:14:57,280 --> 00:14:58,280]  has been decreasing.\n",
            "[00:14:58,280 --> 00:15:00,280]  So that offsets some of the growth.\n",
            "[00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:03,280]  So we just have to do more with our 5G.\n",
            "[00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:10,280]  So the top-line priority for our 2021 is to accelerate our 5G service adoption.\n",
            "[00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:12,280]  So we'll continue to do that.\n",
            "[00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:16,280]  As I reported earlier, we have been seeing a very strong adoption.\n",
            "[00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:18,280]  So we just need to continue to do that.\n",
            "[00:15:18,280 --> 00:15:23,280]  And then the fact that we got certified as the fastest\n",
            "[00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:27,280]  or the most robust 5G network, that certainly would help as well.\n",
            "[00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:35,890]  So we see very active leadership of the new graph for the 5G customers.\n",
            "[00:15:35,890 --> 00:15:37,890]  So we are pleased to see that.\n",
            "[00:15:37,890 --> 00:15:39,890]  So we'll continue to do that.\n",
            "[00:15:39,890 --> 00:15:43,890]  And then in the ICT and our enterprise area, you know,\n",
            "[00:15:43,890 --> 00:15:47,890]  ICT has been considered as our growth engine.\n",
            "[00:15:47,890 --> 00:15:49,890]  And then so we'll continue to grow that,\n",
            "[00:15:49,890 --> 00:15:52,890]  and then we will grow the profitable ICT business.\n",
            "[00:15:52,890 --> 00:15:59,890]  In the last two years by our work for our IT and also the transformation office,\n",
            "[00:15:59,890 --> 00:16:06,370]  which have been concentrating on building those ICT solutions with the big data,\n",
            "[00:16:06,370 --> 00:16:10,370]  artificial intelligence, machine learning, and IoT type of technology.\n",
            "[00:16:10,370 --> 00:16:14,370]  So we have more of those homegrown solutions\n",
            "[00:16:14,370 --> 00:16:17,370]  and also some of those we co-created with our partners.\n",
            "[00:16:17,370 --> 00:16:23,370]  So now we have very solid products per se for the ICT business.\n",
            "[00:16:23,370 --> 00:16:27,370]  So we believe that we will continue to grow it\n",
            "[00:16:27,370 --> 00:16:31,370]  and also the margin that will also get better and better.\n",
            "[00:16:31,370 --> 00:16:34,370]  And then in terms of the consumer,\n",
            "[00:16:34,370 --> 00:16:38,370]  even though from the mobile service area that we see,\n",
            "[00:16:38,370 --> 00:16:44,370]  except for the 5G uplift that we are hoping it will eventually,\n",
            "[00:16:44,370 --> 00:16:48,370]  and it will, actually it's not just hoping, we can see that.\n",
            "[00:16:48,370 --> 00:16:52,370]  Our pool will eventually later this year,\n",
            "[00:16:52,370 --> 00:16:56,370]  then we should start showing year-over-year positives.\n",
            "[00:16:56,370 --> 00:16:59,370]  So that is certainly a good sign.\n",
            "[00:16:59,370 --> 00:17:04,370]  Other than that, overall we do see that the mobile service revenue\n",
            "[00:17:04,370 --> 00:17:08,370]  because of the competition and also the saturation has been declining.\n",
            "[00:17:08,370 --> 00:17:10,370]  It's kind of the big trend.\n",
            "[00:17:10,370 --> 00:17:14,370]  And then so to offset that, 5G certainly helps.\n",
            "[00:17:14,370 --> 00:17:20,370]  But then we need to, and then the customer base is already pretty much fixed.\n",
            "[00:17:20,370 --> 00:17:25,370]  Taiwan just has 23 million people, right?\n",
            "[00:17:25,370 --> 00:17:26,370]  So that is fixed.\n",
            "[00:17:26,370 --> 00:17:31,370]  So how do we grow the total customer value or contribution per user?\n",
            "[00:17:31,370 --> 00:17:34,370]  And then so that is something we will work on.\n",
            "[00:17:34,370 --> 00:17:38,370]  And we have launched Mobile Circle earlier this year.\n",
            "[00:17:38,370 --> 00:17:43,370]  And then that already shows active users like more than a million every month.\n",
            "[00:17:43,370 --> 00:17:47,370]  So that is our way of bonding with our customers more closely\n",
            "[00:17:47,370 --> 00:17:49,370]  and we want more loyal customers.\n",
            "[00:17:49,370 --> 00:17:51,370]  And then so we will know our customers better\n",
            "[00:17:51,370 --> 00:17:55,370]  and then we can offer them more services as well.\n",
            "[00:17:55,370 --> 00:17:59,370]  So then the total customer value or contributions that we can get,\n",
            "[00:17:59,370 --> 00:18:04,370]  even from the pretty much fixed number of customers that we can grab,\n",
            "[00:18:04,370 --> 00:18:07,370]  but then the total value will still grow.\n",
            "[00:18:07,370 --> 00:18:13,370]  So that's how we will grow our consumer-facing business or revenue.\n",
            "[00:18:13,370 --> 00:18:18,370]  And then last but not least, we'll continue to control our costs\n",
            "[00:18:18,370 --> 00:18:24,370]  and also how we can smartly invest our capital.\n",
            "[00:18:24,370 --> 00:18:28,370]  And this, you know, like for our 5G network,\n",
            "[00:18:28,370 --> 00:18:30,370]  although we have a fact this,\n",
            "[00:18:30,370 --> 00:18:35,370]  but then we didn't deploy as many as some of our rivalries or our peers\n",
            "[00:18:35,370 --> 00:18:37,370]  in terms of the number of stations.\n",
            "[00:18:37,370 --> 00:18:42,370]  But then that's really, it's by design because we believe in, you know,\n",
            "[00:18:42,370 --> 00:18:44,370]  we use the big data and the analysis\n",
            "[00:18:44,370 --> 00:18:47,370]  and we use the AI machine learning to actually see\n",
            "[00:18:47,370 --> 00:18:51,370]  where we should deploy and how many to optimize our investment.\n",
            "[00:18:51,370 --> 00:18:54,370]  And also this, you have to know where your customers are,\n",
            "[00:18:54,370 --> 00:18:58,370]  your existing customers, and where you deploy that will best,\n",
            "[00:18:58,370 --> 00:19:00,370]  you know, will give them the best performance.\n",
            "[00:19:00,370 --> 00:19:03,370]  So all those factors are considered\n",
            "[00:19:03,370 --> 00:19:05,370]  when we determine our deployment strategy.\n",
            "[00:19:05,370 --> 00:19:07,370]  And we have done that very well.\n",
            "[00:19:07,370 --> 00:19:11,370]  And then now you can see we didn't have as much, you know,\n",
            "[00:19:11,370 --> 00:19:14,370]  bandwidth with our peer, Chung-Hai,\n",
            "[00:19:14,370 --> 00:19:17,370]  and we didn't deploy as many than our other peers.\n",
            "[00:19:18,370 --> 00:19:23,370]  But then we were still certified by two independent third-party,\n",
            "[00:19:23,370 --> 00:19:26,370]  you know, speed test companies that we are the best\n",
            "[00:19:26,370 --> 00:19:28,370]  when it comes to the 5G performance.\n",
            "[00:19:28,370 --> 00:19:36,370]  So that is to tell you we use our capital very smartly, very cautiously.\n",
            "[00:19:36,370 --> 00:19:40,370]  Now, although this year's capital plan is more,\n",
            "[00:19:40,370 --> 00:19:44,370]  but then it should peak because we see our network deployment\n",
            "[00:19:44,370 --> 00:19:47,370]  in terms of the 5G, the new radio.\n",
            "[00:19:47,370 --> 00:19:50,370]  This year's deployment should be the peak, right?\n",
            "[00:19:50,370 --> 00:19:54,370]  After that, you know, it's like the last leg of a few more thousands.\n",
            "[00:19:54,370 --> 00:19:56,370]  That should complete a total network.\n",
            "[00:19:56,370 --> 00:20:00,370]  So we really are accelerating the construction of it\n",
            "[00:20:00,370 --> 00:20:04,370]  and probably because the government is asking us to do that.\n",
            "[00:20:04,370 --> 00:20:06,370]  But then also, you know, if we have to do this,\n",
            "[00:20:06,370 --> 00:20:09,370]  we might as well just, you know, get it done sooner\n",
            "[00:20:09,370 --> 00:20:13,370]  so more folks can see the benefit and can appreciate the benefit\n",
            "[00:20:13,370 --> 00:20:15,370]  and can get on the 5G network.\n",
            "[00:20:15,370 --> 00:20:20,370]  So that's why this year's capital investment in the 5G should peak.\n",
            "[00:20:20,370 --> 00:20:24,370]  But then as I said, by utilizing the AI and big data,\n",
            "[00:20:24,370 --> 00:20:27,370]  we think we are deploying very smartly.\n",
            "[00:20:27,370 --> 00:20:30,370]  And then because of the number of stations, you know,\n",
            "[00:20:30,370 --> 00:20:33,370]  the more stations that you deploy, the more utilities,\n",
            "[00:20:33,370 --> 00:20:36,370]  the rental and all that would also come up.\n",
            "[00:20:36,370 --> 00:20:39,370]  And then that's why it will impact that as well.\n",
            "[00:20:39,370 --> 00:20:41,370]  But then on the other hand, there are costs that, you know,\n",
            "[00:20:41,370 --> 00:20:43,370]  we can control and we will control.\n",
            "[00:20:43,370 --> 00:20:48,370]  So we will continue to do that to be slim in our spending.\n",
            "[00:20:48,370 --> 00:20:51,460]  And then so that will help improve our bottom line.\n",
            "[00:20:51,460 --> 00:20:55,460]  As you can see in our forecast for this year,\n",
            "[00:20:55,460 --> 00:21:00,460]  we actually projected our EPS to be 2.57.\n",
            "[00:21:00,460 --> 00:21:05,460]  That's one cent higher than, you know, 2.56, the actual for last year.\n",
            "[00:21:05,460 --> 00:21:10,460]  Even though last year's forecast was 2.46, we overachieved our target.\n",
            "[00:21:10,460 --> 00:21:13,460]  This is the first year in quite a few years\n",
            "[00:21:13,460 --> 00:21:17,460]  that we actually had our EPS target higher than before.\n",
            "[00:21:17,460 --> 00:21:20,460]  So we want to show this is a turning point\n",
            "[00:21:20,460 --> 00:21:23,460]  and then things will get better from now on.\n",
            "[00:21:23,460 --> 00:21:24,460]  All right.\n",
            "[00:21:24,460 --> 00:21:29,540]  So then we'll get to dividends.\n",
            "[00:21:29,540 --> 00:21:33,280]  If you have already seen the distribution of our dividend\n",
            "[00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:38,870]  as 3.25 like last year,\n",
            "[00:21:38,870 --> 00:21:43,770]  and we want to maintain a stable dividend commitment to our shareholders.\n",
            "[00:21:43,770 --> 00:21:50,140]  Also in the future in the company's business that we will continue to do better.\n",
            "[00:21:50,140 --> 00:21:51,180]  Okay.\n",
            "[00:21:51,180 --> 00:21:52,180]  With that, thank you.\n",
            "[00:21:52,180 --> 00:21:55,360]  And then we'll take questions.\n",
            "[00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:56,360]  Thank you, President Xi.\n",
            "[00:21:56,360 --> 00:22:00,360]  And ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin our question and answer session.\n",
            "[00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:03,360]  If you have a question for any of today's speakers,\n",
            "[00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:07,360]  please press 01 on your telephone keypad and you will enter the queue.\n",
            "[00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:10,360]  After you are announced, please ask your question.\n",
            "[00:22:10,360 --> 00:22:14,360]  If you find that your question has been answered before it is your turn to speak,\n",
            "[00:22:14,360 --> 00:22:17,360]  please press 02 to cancel the question.\n",
            "[00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:18,360]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:22:18,360 --> 00:22:20,360]  Now please press 01 to ask the question.\n",
            "[00:22:20,360 --> 00:22:21,360]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:28,660]  Our first question is coming from Peter Millican, Deutsche Bank.\n",
            "[00:22:28,660 --> 00:22:30,460]  Go ahead, please.\n",
            "[00:22:30,460 --> 00:22:31,460]  Yeah.\n",
            "[00:22:31,460 --> 00:22:32,460]  Hi.\n",
            "[00:22:32,460 --> 00:22:33,460]  Good afternoon.\n",
            "[00:22:33,460 --> 00:22:36,460]  And yes, it is good to see guidance finally being positive.\n",
            "[00:22:36,460 --> 00:22:40,460]  My question is really on the 5G APU uplift of 15%.\n",
            "[00:22:40,460 --> 00:22:42,460]  That's great to see.\n",
            "[00:22:42,460 --> 00:22:47,460]  Can you just explain a little bit about how that occurs?\n",
            "[00:22:47,460 --> 00:22:51,460]  Because I don't think the pricing of 5G is that much higher than 4G.\n",
            "[00:22:51,460 --> 00:22:56,680]  Is it that a lot of users had old phones\n",
            "[00:22:56,680 --> 00:23:00,680]  and had migrated down to, say, 499 plans\n",
            "[00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:05,680]  and had been kind of waiting for a new handset\n",
            "[00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:08,680]  when maybe a 5G or a better iPhone came out?\n",
            "[00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:15,830]  Or is it something more about 5G demand in itself?\n",
            "[00:23:15,830 --> 00:23:16,830]  Okay.\n",
            "[00:23:17,830 --> 00:23:19,830]  Well, first of all, let me explain.\n",
            "[00:23:19,830 --> 00:23:22,830]  So when we talked about more than 15% uplift,\n",
            "[00:23:22,830 --> 00:23:26,830]  we were referring to the monthly fee, not our pool,\n",
            "[00:23:26,830 --> 00:23:29,830]  because our pool will include other revenues,\n",
            "[00:23:29,830 --> 00:23:33,830]  such as if they have an overusage on their telephone minutes, right,\n",
            "[00:23:33,830 --> 00:23:35,830]  so you get extra revenue and all that.\n",
            "[00:23:35,830 --> 00:23:38,830]  So it's all included in our pool.\n",
            "[00:23:38,830 --> 00:23:41,830]  But here we are comparing apple to apple from the monthly,\n",
            "[00:23:41,830 --> 00:23:45,830]  pure monthly, you know, rate, the rate plan that they sign up.\n",
            "[00:23:45,830 --> 00:23:50,830]  So for those customers that are renewed since we launched the iPhone in July,\n",
            "[00:23:50,830 --> 00:23:53,830]  so we take all the renewal customers, right,\n",
            "[00:23:53,830 --> 00:23:56,830]  what rate plans they were on before,\n",
            "[00:23:56,830 --> 00:24:00,830]  and then after, you know, they renew, too, the new ones in 5G.\n",
            "[00:24:00,830 --> 00:24:02,830]  So you take the average, the difference, right?\n",
            "[00:24:02,830 --> 00:24:04,830]  And then if you look at it each month,\n",
            "[00:24:04,830 --> 00:24:08,830]  actually we see the uplift, you know, continue to increase.\n",
            "[00:24:08,830 --> 00:24:11,830]  And then, you know, that's why I said that the figure,\n",
            "[00:24:11,830 --> 00:24:16,830]  if it's even bigger for this last month or so.\n",
            "[00:24:16,830 --> 00:24:18,830]  So that's how we calculate it.\n",
            "[00:24:18,830 --> 00:24:24,830]  And then if you look at the average rate plan for those early adopters, right,\n",
            "[00:24:24,830 --> 00:24:28,830]  for the 5G, they are actually already on the higher rate plan.\n",
            "[00:24:28,830 --> 00:24:30,830]  So they are not the 499, you know, group.\n",
            "[00:24:30,830 --> 00:24:31,830]  They are not.\n",
            "[00:24:31,830 --> 00:24:36,830]  But those 499s are a very small number, if any, in our early adopters.\n",
            "[00:24:36,830 --> 00:24:40,830]  So our early adopters are already on the higher plan, you know,\n",
            "[00:24:40,830 --> 00:24:45,830]  like maybe they are the 999 or 799 kind of rate plan.\n",
            "[00:24:45,830 --> 00:24:50,830]  But then, you know, because we have priced our 5G, you know, rate plan so that,\n",
            "[00:24:50,830 --> 00:24:54,830]  you know, the higher rates are more encouraging,\n",
            "[00:24:54,830 --> 00:24:58,830]  are more attractive than the lower rates.\n",
            "[00:24:58,830 --> 00:25:01,830]  So that's why we said the double cake,\n",
            "[00:25:01,830 --> 00:25:04,830]  kind of an icing on the cake kind of strategy.\n",
            "[00:25:04,830 --> 00:25:08,830]  So if they sign up with 999 and then they, even they, you know,\n",
            "[00:25:08,830 --> 00:25:14,830]  use up their data usage when they drop to the 4G,\n",
            "[00:25:14,830 --> 00:25:17,830]  we still give them the very good, you know, kind of speed.\n",
            "[00:25:17,830 --> 00:25:21,830]  You know, but then if you go with the lower plan and then now when you drop\n",
            "[00:25:21,830 --> 00:25:25,830]  to the 4G plan after you, you know, over your data coverage,\n",
            "[00:25:25,830 --> 00:25:29,830]  your data limit, your speed is slower.\n",
            "[00:25:29,830 --> 00:25:35,830]  So we kind of differentiate our offers so that the upper level ones become more,\n",
            "[00:25:35,830 --> 00:25:37,830]  you know, attractive.\n",
            "[00:25:37,830 --> 00:25:41,830]  And then so I would consider as our strategy worked, you know,\n",
            "[00:25:41,830 --> 00:25:43,830]  our pricing strategy worked really well.\n",
            "[00:25:43,830 --> 00:25:47,830]  As I don't know if you know, but then when we announced our, you know,\n",
            "[00:25:47,830 --> 00:25:50,830]  pricing, because we are the third, we, you know,\n",
            "[00:25:50,830 --> 00:25:56,830]  Chung-Hwa and Taiwan Mobile, they did on the, what, June 30th, right?\n",
            "[00:25:56,830 --> 00:25:59,830]  And we came out on the third.\n",
            "[00:25:59,830 --> 00:26:03,830]  So as soon as we announced our pricing plan, my peers,\n",
            "[00:26:03,830 --> 00:26:08,830]  our peers actually changed theirs like in a day or within a week.\n",
            "[00:26:08,830 --> 00:26:11,830]  So I think our pricing strategy worked, worked pretty well,\n",
            "[00:26:11,830 --> 00:26:15,830]  and then that definitely contributes to what we are seeing right now.\n",
            "[00:26:15,830 --> 00:26:18,310]  I hope that helps.\n",
            "[00:26:18,310 --> 00:26:19,310]  Yeah, that's very clear.\n",
            "[00:26:19,310 --> 00:26:20,660]  Thank you very much.\n",
            "[00:26:20,660 --> 00:26:24,060]  Sure.\n",
            "[00:26:24,060 --> 00:26:27,060]  And the next question is coming from Sarah Wong, Alpha Mocha Stanley.\n",
            "[00:26:27,060 --> 00:26:28,060]  Go ahead, please.\n",
            "[00:26:28,060 --> 00:26:31,210]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:26:31,210 --> 00:26:33,210]  I have two questions.\n",
            "[00:26:33,210 --> 00:26:37,210]  So first one is still on like new economy business.\n",
            "[00:26:37,210 --> 00:26:40,210]  So say for 2020,\n",
            "[00:26:40,210 --> 00:26:44,210]  how much revenue does it contribute to the overall revenue as\n",
            "[00:26:44,210 --> 00:26:45,210]  percentage?\n",
            "[00:26:45,210 --> 00:26:52,210]  And also do we expect, say, ICT margin where we spend going into 2021?\n",
            "[00:26:52,210 --> 00:26:56,210]  And then my second question is on the guidance for next year.\n",
            "[00:26:56,210 --> 00:27:02,210]  So first of all, we guided growth in overall revenue,\n",
            "[00:27:02,210 --> 00:27:04,210]  but EBITDA remains flat.\n",
            "[00:27:04,210 --> 00:27:10,210]  So may I ask what is the major cost item that increased for next year?\n",
            "[00:27:10,210 --> 00:27:16,210]  And also, since we guided a flat, largely flat EBITDA trend,\n",
            "[00:27:16,210 --> 00:27:18,210]  and at the same time,\n",
            "[00:27:18,210 --> 00:27:21,210]  there are the incremental five-year monetization costs.\n",
            "[00:27:21,210 --> 00:27:25,210]  But still, like we guided net profit to be stable.\n",
            "[00:27:25,210 --> 00:27:29,210]  So is there anything else that offset the increase in the,\n",
            "[00:27:29,210 --> 00:27:31,210]  like, 5G spectrum cost?\n",
            "[00:27:31,210 --> 00:27:33,140]  Okay.\n",
            "[00:27:33,140 --> 00:27:34,140]  Hi, Sarah.\n",
            "[00:27:34,140 --> 00:27:37,140]  So the first, let me answer your first question.\n",
            "[00:27:37,140 --> 00:27:39,140]  That's more straightforward.\n",
            "[00:27:39,140 --> 00:27:44,140]  So the new economy last year we ended, it is like 15%.\n",
            "[00:27:44,140 --> 00:27:50,140]  It accounts for 15% of our total revenue, which was $79.5 million.\n",
            "[00:27:50,140 --> 00:27:51,140]  Right?\n",
            "[00:27:51,140 --> 00:27:53,140]  So 15% of that.\n",
            "[00:27:53,140 --> 00:28:02,380]  It is 11.8, 11.9, 11.899 billion.\n",
            "[00:28:02,380 --> 00:28:04,990]  Yeah, to be exact.\n",
            "[00:28:04,990 --> 00:28:06,990]  So it's 15%.\n",
            "[00:28:06,990 --> 00:28:07,990]  Okay.\n",
            "[00:28:07,990 --> 00:28:13,980]  And then we expect it to be 16% this year.\n",
            "[00:28:13,980 --> 00:28:14,980]  Okay.\n",
            "[00:28:14,980 --> 00:28:20,980]  You probably don't recall this, but then in 2019, we had it for 13%,\n",
            "[00:28:20,980 --> 00:28:24,980]  and then we projected, you know, for 2020, it will be 15%.\n",
            "[00:28:24,980 --> 00:28:26,980]  So we have a kind of bigger delta.\n",
            "[00:28:26,980 --> 00:28:30,980]  And this year we are more conservative because, you know,\n",
            "[00:28:30,980 --> 00:28:34,980]  there's a lack in terms of the ICT revenue realization.\n",
            "[00:28:34,980 --> 00:28:37,980]  So you need to get the projects, the contracts, and all that.\n",
            "[00:28:37,980 --> 00:28:40,980]  And it takes some time, some months to deliver.\n",
            "[00:28:40,980 --> 00:28:45,980]  And then with 2020, the pandemic impact, we do see, you know,\n",
            "[00:28:45,980 --> 00:28:49,980]  even government or some companies that they were, you know,\n",
            "[00:28:49,980 --> 00:28:53,980]  retracting their capital spending or they were, you know,\n",
            "[00:28:53,980 --> 00:28:54,980]  slowing down on that.\n",
            "[00:28:54,980 --> 00:28:58,980]  So that does affect the number of contracts that we would otherwise get.\n",
            "[00:28:58,980 --> 00:29:02,980]  So that would have a, you know, delayed effect in terms of the revenue.\n",
            "[00:29:02,980 --> 00:29:07,980]  That's why we are not as aggressive as we have been in the last few years\n",
            "[00:29:07,980 --> 00:29:09,980]  when it comes to ICT growth.\n",
            "[00:29:09,980 --> 00:29:12,980]  And we are just, you know, kind of smooth it out to be more realistic.\n",
            "[00:29:12,980 --> 00:29:18,980]  But still, we are happy with the two-digit growth that we expect to get\n",
            "[00:29:18,980 --> 00:29:19,980]  from the ICT.\n",
            "[00:29:19,980 --> 00:29:22,550]  Okay.\n",
            "[00:29:22,550 --> 00:29:26,550]  And your second question is that our revenue is about 3.5\n",
            "[00:29:26,550 --> 00:29:31,920]  or EBITDA is flat or 8.4%.\n",
            "[00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:33,920]  And what was the major reason?\n",
            "[00:29:33,920 --> 00:29:38,920]  It's really because of the deployment, the rollout of the 5G.\n",
            "[00:29:38,920 --> 00:29:42,920]  First of all, you know, this is about the OPEC, right?\n",
            "[00:29:42,920 --> 00:29:47,920]  So the OPEC, like I mentioned, as we add each of these radios,\n",
            "[00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:51,920]  even to those existing stations we already have out there,\n",
            "[00:29:51,920 --> 00:29:54,920]  the same location, the base station's location,\n",
            "[00:29:54,920 --> 00:29:58,920]  but then the landowner will charge us more just for their rental, right?\n",
            "[00:29:58,920 --> 00:30:01,920]  So that is the monthly kind of thing.\n",
            "[00:30:01,920 --> 00:30:04,920]  And also more utility, more power consumption.\n",
            "[00:30:04,920 --> 00:30:06,920]  So all those, you know,\n",
            "[00:30:06,920 --> 00:30:10,920]  and then we have a pretty aggressive rollout plan this year.\n",
            "[00:30:10,920 --> 00:30:15,920]  So that's why we anticipated, you know, the OPEC will go up.\n",
            "[00:30:15,920 --> 00:30:17,920]  But then on the other hand, like I said,\n",
            "[00:30:17,920 --> 00:30:20,920]  there are some OPEC that may be in the back office\n",
            "[00:30:20,920 --> 00:30:24,920]  or in some, you know, non-construction related.\n",
            "[00:30:24,920 --> 00:30:27,920]  We will see how we can scrutinize it more\n",
            "[00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:29,920]  and then we'll continue to control our costs.\n",
            "[00:30:29,920 --> 00:30:34,920]  And hopefully, eventually we should still have a good positive\n",
            "[00:30:34,920 --> 00:30:38,920]  or at least flat and not negative in terms of the EBITDA growth.\n",
            "[00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:42,580]  Okay.\n",
            "[00:30:42,580 --> 00:30:46,580]  And then you have third party of a question, Sarah, about some 5G.\n",
            "[00:30:46,580 --> 00:30:48,580]  Can you repeat that for me if you remember?\n",
            "[00:30:48,580 --> 00:30:51,020]  Yeah.\n",
            "[00:30:51,020 --> 00:30:56,020]  So I would assume that in 2020, there was only a half year,\n",
            "[00:30:56,020 --> 00:31:01,020]  less than a half year impact from like 5G spectrum monetization cost.\n",
            "[00:31:01,020 --> 00:31:04,020]  So for this year, it would be a four-year impact.\n",
            "[00:31:04,020 --> 00:31:08,020]  So given our guidance on EBITDA is to be flat,\n",
            "[00:31:08,020 --> 00:31:12,020]  so while our net income is also flat,\n",
            "[00:31:12,020 --> 00:31:17,020]  so assuming like 5G spectrum monetization cost will be higher this year.\n",
            "[00:31:17,020 --> 00:31:19,020]  Right.\n",
            "[00:31:19,020 --> 00:31:24,020]  Yes, you're definitely right about the 5G amortization being higher.\n",
            "[00:31:24,020 --> 00:31:31,020]  And luckily, you know, for when it comes to the 3G and 4G depreciation,\n",
            "[00:31:31,020 --> 00:31:34,020]  that actually they helped us because it has come down.\n",
            "[00:31:34,020 --> 00:31:39,020]  And then so that helped offset the amortization\n",
            "[00:31:39,020 --> 00:31:42,020]  that we see the increase for 5G.\n",
            "[00:31:42,020 --> 00:31:47,020]  And also we have a building that we are planning to sell\n",
            "[00:31:47,020 --> 00:31:51,020]  and that will definitely help some with the bottom line as well.\n",
            "[00:31:51,020 --> 00:31:56,120]  Got it.\n",
            "[00:31:56,120 --> 00:31:59,120]  Like, is there any like government subsidy that you have,\n",
            "[00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:03,120]  like economic, like take into account for the guidance?\n",
            "[00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:09,220]  Very, very conservatively because right now it is still, you know,\n",
            "[00:32:09,220 --> 00:32:13,220]  being discussed and so it's not being finalized,\n",
            "[00:32:13,220 --> 00:32:16,220]  although we are hopeful it will come out.\n",
            "[00:32:16,220 --> 00:32:20,220]  But then right now, we have some consideration for that,\n",
            "[00:32:20,220 --> 00:32:24,950]  but very conservatively, not significant.\n",
            "[00:32:24,950 --> 00:32:25,950]  Got it.\n",
            "[00:32:25,950 --> 00:32:26,950]  Very helpful.\n",
            "[00:32:26,950 --> 00:32:28,110]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:32:28,110 --> 00:32:31,190]  Sure.\n",
            "[00:32:31,190 --> 00:32:34,190]  As a reminder, please press 01 on your keypad\n",
            "[00:32:34,190 --> 00:32:35,190]  if you would like to ask a question.\n",
            "[00:32:35,190 --> 00:32:36,190]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:32:36,190 --> 00:32:41,310]  Now we'll have Billy Lee of Great Suisse for questions.\n",
            "[00:32:41,310 --> 00:32:45,350]  Go ahead, please.\n",
            "[00:32:45,350 --> 00:32:46,350]  Hi, Manager.\n",
            "[00:32:46,350 --> 00:32:48,350]  Thank you for talking to me.\n",
            "[00:32:48,350 --> 00:32:51,350]  I have two simple questions.\n",
            "[00:32:51,350 --> 00:32:56,350]  One, can you remind us what is the 5G base station we have now\n",
            "[00:32:56,350 --> 00:32:58,350]  and what is the current 5G penetration?\n",
            "[00:32:58,350 --> 00:33:00,350]  That's the first question.\n",
            "[00:33:00,350 --> 00:33:04,350]  And the second question is also a follow-up to the previous question\n",
            "[00:33:04,350 --> 00:33:07,350]  on the net profit.\n",
            "[00:33:07,350 --> 00:33:12,350]  I understand you're saying like the 3G and 4G depreciation is coming down\n",
            "[00:33:12,350 --> 00:33:14,350]  so we are seeing a flat net profit.\n",
            "[00:33:14,350 --> 00:33:19,700]  But it looks like does that mean that the 3G and 4G depreciation\n",
            "[00:33:19,700 --> 00:33:21,700]  is coming down quite a lot?\n",
            "[00:33:21,700 --> 00:33:26,700]  Because if you think about it, we have like almost 40 billion spectrum payment\n",
            "[00:33:26,700 --> 00:33:28,700]  and 20 years of amortization.\n",
            "[00:33:28,700 --> 00:33:32,700]  That means like $2 billion of amortization each year.\n",
            "[00:33:32,700 --> 00:33:38,700]  And I'm just a little bit surprised by the extent of that sharp offset\n",
            "[00:33:38,700 --> 00:33:39,700]  by the 3G and 4G.\n",
            "[00:33:39,700 --> 00:33:41,700]  Could you elaborate a little bit on that?\n",
            "[00:33:41,700 --> 00:33:42,700]  That would be very helpful.\n",
            "[00:33:42,700 --> 00:33:43,700]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:33:43,700 --> 00:33:45,120]  Okay.\n",
            "[00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:46,120]  All right.\n",
            "[00:33:46,120 --> 00:33:47,120]  Hi, Bill.\n",
            "[00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:52,120]  So to answer the first question, we now have 4,600 or so stations\n",
            "[00:33:52,120 --> 00:33:56,120]  or close to 4,700 already deployed as we speak.\n",
            "[00:33:56,120 --> 00:34:06,060]  And then that covers 61% of the population past, island-wide.\n",
            "[00:34:06,060 --> 00:34:07,060]  Okay?\n",
            "[00:34:07,060 --> 00:34:08,480]  All right.\n",
            "[00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:12,770]  How about the subscriber penetration?\n",
            "[00:34:12,770 --> 00:34:13,770]  Okay.\n",
            "[00:34:14,770 --> 00:34:17,770]  Well, so I think you're talking about like a percentage.\n",
            "[00:34:17,770 --> 00:34:22,770]  And, you know, we are shy of half a million, you know, subscribers.\n",
            "[00:34:22,770 --> 00:34:31,400]  But then we're still looking at 25% to 30% before the end of the year.\n",
            "[00:34:31,400 --> 00:34:32,400]  Okay.\n",
            "[00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:33,400]  Got it.\n",
            "[00:34:33,400 --> 00:34:34,400]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:36,400]  And then how about the last question?\n",
            "[00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:37,940]  Yes.\n",
            "[00:34:37,940 --> 00:34:38,940]  So, yes.\n",
            "[00:34:38,940 --> 00:34:44,940]  So for the 3G and 4G, you know, depreciation definitely has come down a lot.\n",
            "[00:34:44,940 --> 00:34:48,940]  We also write off, wrote off some of the 3G equipment.\n",
            "[00:34:48,940 --> 00:34:53,940]  So that helps with the reduction on the depreciation as well.\n",
            "[00:34:53,940 --> 00:34:58,940]  So, so far we do see that helps a lot, you know,\n",
            "[00:34:58,940 --> 00:35:02,940]  in terms of offset our 5G amortization.\n",
            "[00:35:02,940 --> 00:35:05,940]  And, you know, the depreciation is really just starting.\n",
            "[00:35:05,940 --> 00:35:10,940]  But then on the other hand, as I mentioned, we have one building.\n",
            "[00:35:11,940 --> 00:35:16,940]  We actually all together, FET has like three buildings in the neighborhood area.\n",
            "[00:35:16,940 --> 00:35:19,940]  And we have been doing some agile projects, you know,\n",
            "[00:35:19,940 --> 00:35:22,940]  the renovation of the headquarters and the other buildings.\n",
            "[00:35:22,940 --> 00:35:27,940]  So we are able to get our teams, you know, close together for collaboration.\n",
            "[00:35:27,940 --> 00:35:29,940]  And then so as a result,\n",
            "[00:35:29,940 --> 00:35:33,940]  we actually see the opportunity to activate our asset a little more.\n",
            "[00:35:33,940 --> 00:35:38,940]  So there's one building where our enterprise unit is occupying right now\n",
            "[00:35:38,940 --> 00:35:40,940]  can be emptied.\n",
            "[00:35:40,940 --> 00:35:42,940]  And then so we plan to sell that.\n",
            "[00:35:42,940 --> 00:35:44,940]  And then the proceeds will be, you know,\n",
            "[00:35:44,940 --> 00:35:47,940]  helping with the net income this year as well.\n",
            "[00:35:47,940 --> 00:35:52,540]  Great. Thank you.\n",
            "[00:35:52,540 --> 00:35:54,140]  Sure.\n",
            "[00:35:54,140 --> 00:35:59,900]  And the next question is coming from Benny June of Bank of America.\n",
            "[00:35:59,900 --> 00:36:00,900]  Go ahead, please.\n",
            "[00:36:00,900 --> 00:36:04,830]  Hi. Thank you, management, for taking my questions.\n",
            "[00:36:04,830 --> 00:36:06,830]  Just two quick questions.\n",
            "[00:36:06,830 --> 00:36:10,830]  The first is actually about the CapEx budget.\n",
            "[00:36:11,830 --> 00:36:19,830]  I noticed that the company budget roughly about $15 billion for CapEx for coming year.\n",
            "[00:36:19,830 --> 00:36:26,830]  I assume not all of those $15 billion will be spent on the radio access network.\n",
            "[00:36:26,830 --> 00:36:29,830]  Could you provide us with a little bit more details?\n",
            "[00:36:29,830 --> 00:36:35,830]  What are the major items in terms of that $15 billion CapEx budget?\n",
            "[00:36:35,830 --> 00:36:38,830]  That's my first question.\n",
            "[00:36:38,830 --> 00:36:43,830]  My second question is I assume at the moment,\n",
            "[00:36:43,830 --> 00:36:50,060]  most of our company's 5G service revenue is from the consumers.\n",
            "[00:36:50,060 --> 00:36:55,060]  But if you have to make a projection,\n",
            "[00:36:55,060 --> 00:36:59,060]  say by end of, let's say, 2022 next year,\n",
            "[00:36:59,060 --> 00:37:04,060]  roughly how much percentage of our 5G service revenue will be coming from,\n",
            "[00:37:04,060 --> 00:37:07,060]  say, enterprise or industrial customers?\n",
            "[00:37:07,060 --> 00:37:08,060]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:37:08,060 --> 00:37:10,220]  Okay. All right.\n",
            "[00:37:10,220 --> 00:37:12,220]  Hi, Danny.\n",
            "[00:37:12,220 --> 00:37:15,220]  To answer your first question about the capital, and you're right,\n",
            "[00:37:15,220 --> 00:37:17,220]  even with this network capital,\n",
            "[00:37:17,220 --> 00:37:22,220]  we have more work than deploying the radio stations for 5G this year,\n",
            "[00:37:22,220 --> 00:37:24,220]  if you ask my network team.\n",
            "[00:37:24,220 --> 00:37:29,220]  So for the core network, we are also working on the new 5GC, right?\n",
            "[00:37:29,220 --> 00:37:33,220]  And also, if you look at Volte,\n",
            "[00:37:33,220 --> 00:37:37,220]  we are looking at upgrading our Volte facility as well.\n",
            "[00:37:37,220 --> 00:37:41,220]  And also, we are planning to sunset our 3G.\n",
            "[00:37:41,220 --> 00:37:47,220]  And so that's why we need to have a plan how to deal with our voice traffic.\n",
            "[00:37:47,220 --> 00:37:50,220]  So all those are part of the capital spending plan,\n",
            "[00:37:50,220 --> 00:37:56,220]  although, of course, a big part of it has to do with the 5G rollout.\n",
            "[00:37:56,220 --> 00:38:01,220]  And then some of that would be the software capitalization, right?\n",
            "[00:38:01,220 --> 00:38:06,220]  Because more and more that my team is doing the solutions\n",
            "[00:38:06,220 --> 00:38:08,220]  for enterprise and also for consumers.\n",
            "[00:38:08,220 --> 00:38:12,220]  So like our video, our digital technology, they're all internal.\n",
            "[00:38:12,220 --> 00:38:15,220]  So there's some capitalization there as well.\n",
            "[00:38:15,220 --> 00:38:21,910]  Okay. And then we are done with our TPKC, the telecom park, right?\n",
            "[00:38:21,910 --> 00:38:25,910]  So that construction capital was already all clear.\n",
            "[00:38:25,910 --> 00:38:30,780]  Yeah. So still, a big part of the capital plan is for the network.\n",
            "[00:38:30,780 --> 00:38:34,780]  And then a big part of the network capital is about 5G rollout.\n",
            "[00:38:35,780 --> 00:38:40,780]  But then we do have work on the core network and also our Volte upgrade\n",
            "[00:38:40,780 --> 00:38:44,780]  and also sunset the 3G and then 4G replacement.\n",
            "[00:38:44,780 --> 00:38:50,780]  And then also, there's some ‚Äì actually, this part relates to the next question you have.\n",
            "[00:38:50,780 --> 00:38:53,780]  As we are rolling out our 5G private network,\n",
            "[00:38:53,780 --> 00:38:57,780]  there is some investment in the private network equipment as well.\n",
            "[00:38:57,780 --> 00:39:01,780]  So there we have projected some money, some capital for it.\n",
            "[00:39:01,780 --> 00:39:05,780]  And also, we have a subsidiary, which is a green energy company.\n",
            "[00:39:05,780 --> 00:39:09,780]  So they build the solar ‚Äì the roof, right?\n",
            "[00:39:09,780 --> 00:39:13,780]  So there is some capital required there as well.\n",
            "[00:39:13,780 --> 00:39:18,780]  So that is pretty much constitutes the total capital that we need for this year.\n",
            "[00:39:18,780 --> 00:39:24,260]  So for the second question you have, and you're right, because for the 5G service,\n",
            "[00:39:24,260 --> 00:39:29,260]  as you know, each consumer that we convert to 5G, they use a 5G service plan.\n",
            "[00:39:29,260 --> 00:39:33,260]  It's very straightforward, so that revenue counts towards 5G,\n",
            "[00:39:33,260 --> 00:39:38,260]  even though the 5G network is constructed on top of 4G.\n",
            "[00:39:38,260 --> 00:39:42,260]  So there's still part of it when it's not on 5G, it's on 4G.\n",
            "[00:39:42,260 --> 00:39:47,260]  But then still, we kind of found that for our own analysis purpose,\n",
            "[00:39:47,260 --> 00:39:53,260]  you can easily identify how many 5G subscribers versus 4G subscribers.\n",
            "[00:39:53,260 --> 00:39:58,350]  But when it comes to enterprise, 5G connectivity or whatever G that is,\n",
            "[00:39:58,350 --> 00:40:01,350]  the connectivity usually, when it comes to the enterprise,\n",
            "[00:40:01,350 --> 00:40:04,350]  it's really just the enabler, right?\n",
            "[00:40:04,350 --> 00:40:10,890]  This is not like ‚Äì if you're talking about this is still the old Telugu,\n",
            "[00:40:10,890 --> 00:40:15,070]  we have our enterprise mobile 5G.\n",
            "[00:40:15,070 --> 00:40:20,580]  But then when we gave you the number about the total subscriber,\n",
            "[00:40:20,580 --> 00:40:22,580]  because they are still consumers after all,\n",
            "[00:40:22,580 --> 00:40:25,580]  even though those are through the enterprise account.\n",
            "[00:40:25,580 --> 00:40:30,580]  But then if you were asking how much revenue we were able to use with the enterprise,\n",
            "[00:40:30,580 --> 00:40:33,580]  especially in the ICT area, right?\n",
            "[00:40:33,580 --> 00:40:36,580]  So not in the traditional telecom sense.\n",
            "[00:40:36,580 --> 00:40:42,580]  Then that is trickier, because usually the connectivity is only the lowest layer\n",
            "[00:40:42,580 --> 00:40:44,580]  and it's an enabler.\n",
            "[00:40:44,580 --> 00:40:51,580]  But then on top of it, you have other layers, like the layer of IT, the application,\n",
            "[00:40:51,580 --> 00:40:56,580]  and of course you have some devices that you need.\n",
            "[00:40:56,580 --> 00:41:02,580]  So when it comes to ICT, it's a big kind of composite kind of solution.\n",
            "[00:41:02,580 --> 00:41:06,580]  And then the connectivity usually is only one layer of it.\n",
            "[00:41:06,580 --> 00:41:11,580]  So do you count all of them as the 5G revenue\n",
            "[00:41:11,580 --> 00:41:14,580]  or you want to only take out, okay, how much do you charge them?\n",
            "[00:41:14,580 --> 00:41:17,580]  And usually for this part, you charge them monthly.\n",
            "[00:41:17,580 --> 00:41:21,580]  And then even with that, there is some managed aspect of it.\n",
            "[00:41:21,580 --> 00:41:24,580]  So it's not still just purely the connectivity.\n",
            "[00:41:24,580 --> 00:41:30,580]  So we actually right now don't have a plan to track that separately,\n",
            "[00:41:30,580 --> 00:41:33,580]  but we can certainly look into that for you.\n",
            "[00:41:33,580 --> 00:41:37,580]  But then we don't really have a target set for that.\n",
            "[00:41:37,580 --> 00:41:41,580]  We do look at, yeah, we need to grow our private network business\n",
            "[00:41:41,580 --> 00:41:43,580]  and then 5G private network.\n",
            "[00:41:43,580 --> 00:41:50,580]  So we can probably report next year, this time, how many private networks we deploy\n",
            "[00:41:50,580 --> 00:41:52,580]  and then the size of the business.\n",
            "[00:41:52,580 --> 00:41:53,580]  We can do that.\n",
            "[00:41:53,580 --> 00:41:59,120]  But then 5G can use in other IoT, just like I said, the telemedicine, right?\n",
            "[00:41:59,120 --> 00:42:02,120]  But then that is not the core of the telemedicine.\n",
            "[00:42:02,120 --> 00:42:04,120]  There is the application that we build.\n",
            "[00:42:04,120 --> 00:42:09,120]  And then, you know, so the connectivity, the 5G part is only, you know,\n",
            "[00:42:09,120 --> 00:42:11,120]  at the beginning, the construction.\n",
            "[00:42:11,120 --> 00:42:14,120]  And then we have a monthly recurring, you know, charge.\n",
            "[00:42:14,120 --> 00:42:17,860]  It's just many different piece parts.\n",
            "[00:42:17,860 --> 00:42:21,460]  Okay, Danny, did I answer your question?\n",
            "[00:42:21,460 --> 00:42:22,820]  Yeah, yeah.\n",
            "[00:42:23,820 --> 00:42:27,820]  I mean, I guess in the first place, the reason why I asked that is because\n",
            "[00:42:27,820 --> 00:42:32,820]  given that before 5G was launched, a lot of people were talking about that\n",
            "[00:42:32,820 --> 00:42:39,820]  eventually 70% of 5G will be used by enterprise, corporate, industrial customers.\n",
            "[00:42:39,820 --> 00:42:42,820]  So eventually, I'm sure investors as well as analysts,\n",
            "[00:42:42,820 --> 00:42:47,820]  they want to keep track of the targeting on track of that\n",
            "[00:42:47,820 --> 00:42:51,820]  or at the end of the day, 5G is still all about consumers.\n",
            "[00:42:51,820 --> 00:42:52,820]  Yeah.\n",
            "[00:42:52,820 --> 00:42:53,820]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:42:53,820 --> 00:42:54,820]  I see.\n",
            "[00:42:54,820 --> 00:42:56,820]  Yeah, I definitely see where you're coming from.\n",
            "[00:42:56,820 --> 00:42:59,820]  And then if this is in the States, in the United States,\n",
            "[00:42:59,820 --> 00:43:02,820]  I would say that's probably even more so the case.\n",
            "[00:43:02,820 --> 00:43:09,820]  But then in Taiwan, we are upgrading our consumers to the more advanced technology\n",
            "[00:43:09,820 --> 00:43:15,100]  because Taiwan is small and we are able to, and with several telcos,\n",
            "[00:43:15,100 --> 00:43:17,100]  we are able to give a very good coverage.\n",
            "[00:43:18,100 --> 00:43:22,100]  So for consumer, we can really get them on 5G end-to-end, right?\n",
            "[00:43:22,100 --> 00:43:28,100]  So still, 5G, the consumer part, is still a big part of the revenue.\n",
            "[00:43:28,100 --> 00:43:34,100]  But then on top of this, there will be more enterprise benefit from 5G\n",
            "[00:43:34,100 --> 00:43:36,100]  other than from the pure telecom sense,\n",
            "[00:43:36,100 --> 00:43:43,100]  but then because of the new smart solutions that could use the benefits of 5G.\n",
            "[00:43:43,100 --> 00:43:45,100]  So you will see more of that.\n",
            "[00:43:46,100 --> 00:43:49,100]  But then I think in Taiwan's case, consumer is still big,\n",
            "[00:43:49,100 --> 00:43:54,100]  but then all those additional smart solutions that you can do with enterprise,\n",
            "[00:43:54,100 --> 00:43:55,100]  they are a bonus.\n",
            "[00:43:55,100 --> 00:43:57,100]  And then the more, the better.\n",
            "[00:43:57,100 --> 00:44:03,200]  But I doubt it will be bigger than the consumer, at least for the time being.\n",
            "[00:44:03,200 --> 00:44:04,200]  I don't see that.\n",
            "[00:44:04,200 --> 00:44:08,420]  In the States, probably, because they just don't have full coverage\n",
            "[00:44:08,420 --> 00:44:11,420]  that they can afford to provide the consumers,\n",
            "[00:44:11,420 --> 00:44:15,420]  and then the consumers will be less willing to upgrade to 5G\n",
            "[00:44:15,420 --> 00:44:18,420]  because the coverage is spotty.\n",
            "[00:44:18,420 --> 00:44:21,420]  But they can certainly do that for enterprise use, right,\n",
            "[00:44:21,420 --> 00:44:24,420]  with private network or concentrated coverage.\n",
            "[00:44:24,420 --> 00:44:26,460]  It will be a different case.\n",
            "[00:44:26,460 --> 00:44:28,640]  Got it.\n",
            "[00:44:28,640 --> 00:44:29,640]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:44:29,640 --> 00:44:31,060]  Sure.\n",
            "[00:44:31,060 --> 00:44:36,650]  The next question is coming from Sarah Wong of Morgan Stanley.\n",
            "[00:44:36,650 --> 00:44:41,370]  Go ahead, please.\n",
            "[00:44:41,370 --> 00:44:42,370]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:44:42,370 --> 00:44:45,370]  Just a quick follow-up on the enterprise ICT revenues.\n",
            "[00:44:46,370 --> 00:44:51,370]  So, for example, in 2020, how much of the revenue comes from, say,\n",
            "[00:44:51,370 --> 00:44:54,370]  pure connectivity or web procurement,\n",
            "[00:44:54,370 --> 00:44:57,370]  and how much does it come from, say, solution\n",
            "[00:44:57,370 --> 00:45:02,370]  or more like value-added service like services?\n",
            "[00:45:02,370 --> 00:45:06,370]  And for next year, so since we are still targeting\n",
            "[00:45:06,370 --> 00:45:08,370]  that more bigger growth in this space,\n",
            "[00:45:08,370 --> 00:45:13,370]  so, like, is there a rough idea, like, how much is driven by spending\n",
            "[00:45:13,370 --> 00:45:17,370]  to new customers or how much is driven by more, say,\n",
            "[00:45:17,370 --> 00:45:22,230]  value-added service to, say, existing customers?\n",
            "[00:45:22,230 --> 00:45:26,230]  Okay, all on the enterprise side, right, Sarah, you're asking?\n",
            "[00:45:26,230 --> 00:45:32,480]  Yeah, on the enterprise ICT revenue side.\n",
            "[00:45:32,480 --> 00:45:33,480]  Right.\n",
            "[00:45:33,480 --> 00:45:39,480]  So I think you were asking how much of the ICT revenue is from the\n",
            "[00:45:39,480 --> 00:45:42,480]  equivalent versus the solution, the software.\n",
            "[00:45:42,480 --> 00:45:45,020]  Is that what you're asking?\n",
            "[00:45:45,020 --> 00:45:46,020]  Yeah, yeah.\n",
            "[00:45:46,020 --> 00:45:49,440]  I don't actually have that breakdown.\n",
            "[00:45:49,440 --> 00:45:52,440]  I have the breakdown of the, you know,\n",
            "[00:45:52,440 --> 00:45:56,440]  ICT business into different kind of product lines.\n",
            "[00:45:56,440 --> 00:46:05,460]  For example, you know, the CIOT or, you know, cloud\n",
            "[00:46:05,460 --> 00:46:11,460]  or it is IOT-related solutions or it is the energy, you know, or security.\n",
            "[00:46:11,460 --> 00:46:12,460]  So I have that.\n",
            "[00:46:12,460 --> 00:46:17,460]  But then, you know, in terms of the further breakdown between the software\n",
            "[00:46:17,460 --> 00:46:19,460]  versus the equipment, that would mean more work.\n",
            "[00:46:19,460 --> 00:46:22,460]  I don't have that handy to provide.\n",
            "[00:46:22,460 --> 00:46:28,460]  And the second question I think you're asking to grow our ICT business,\n",
            "[00:46:28,460 --> 00:46:33,460]  do I see that it's going to be more clients or, you know,\n",
            "[00:46:33,460 --> 00:46:35,460]  more with the existing customers?\n",
            "[00:46:35,460 --> 00:46:37,460]  Is that your question?\n",
            "[00:46:37,460 --> 00:46:39,260]  Yes.\n",
            "[00:46:39,260 --> 00:46:40,300]  Okay.\n",
            "[00:46:40,300 --> 00:46:43,300]  I think it will be both because, you know,\n",
            "[00:46:43,300 --> 00:46:48,300]  we do see a lot of companies or a lot of our clients,\n",
            "[00:46:48,300 --> 00:46:52,300]  they are seeing the value for digital transformation.\n",
            "[00:46:52,300 --> 00:46:55,300]  So when they do that, they have needs for the IOT\n",
            "[00:46:55,300 --> 00:46:58,300]  or the cloud, you know, kind of solutions.\n",
            "[00:46:58,300 --> 00:47:05,300]  And then they'll build on top of the, you know, NBIOT connectivity or 5G.\n",
            "[00:47:05,300 --> 00:47:08,300]  So that's where we can provide solutions for.\n",
            "[00:47:08,300 --> 00:47:11,300]  So those are the existing customers.\n",
            "[00:47:11,300 --> 00:47:14,300]  And on the other hand, because in the last two years,\n",
            "[00:47:14,300 --> 00:47:16,300]  we actually have built, you know,\n",
            "[00:47:16,300 --> 00:47:21,300]  quite a few advanced ICT solutions that we are privatizing.\n",
            "[00:47:21,300 --> 00:47:25,300]  So those we can sell beyond our existing customers,\n",
            "[00:47:25,300 --> 00:47:29,300]  which is also part of our focus this year with my enterprise team.\n",
            "[00:47:29,300 --> 00:47:32,300]  So we need to do, you know, a double-pronged approach.\n",
            "[00:47:32,300 --> 00:47:37,300]  So as a result, you will see newer customers, more new customers,\n",
            "[00:47:37,300 --> 00:47:40,300]  and also with the growth on our existing customers.\n",
            "[00:47:40,300 --> 00:47:42,840]  So it will be both.\n",
            "[00:47:42,840 --> 00:47:43,840]  Got it.\n",
            "[00:47:43,840 --> 00:47:46,840]  And then in terms of the corporate line,\n",
            "[00:47:46,840 --> 00:47:52,840]  so from the perspective of a combination of both revenue contribution\n",
            "[00:47:52,840 --> 00:47:54,840]  as well as growth rate,\n",
            "[00:47:54,840 --> 00:48:00,840]  so which segment do you think is the most promising one in, say,\n",
            "[00:48:00,840 --> 00:48:03,840]  this year or next two or three years?\n",
            "[00:48:03,840 --> 00:48:06,840]  Oh, you're talking about in terms of the industry verticals,\n",
            "[00:48:06,840 --> 00:48:09,840]  which ones I think is most promising?\n",
            "[00:48:09,840 --> 00:48:11,840]  Is that your question?\n",
            "[00:48:11,840 --> 00:48:15,840]  In terms of corporate lines, so cloud service, IoT, security,\n",
            "[00:48:15,840 --> 00:48:21,380]  so presented in a slice.\n",
            "[00:48:21,380 --> 00:48:22,380]  Okay.\n",
            "[00:48:22,380 --> 00:48:23,380]  I see.\n",
            "[00:48:23,380 --> 00:48:24,380]  I see.\n",
            "[00:48:24,380 --> 00:48:25,380]  Okay.\n",
            "[00:48:25,380 --> 00:48:31,610]  Well, I think because IoT is more like a broad, right?\n",
            "[00:48:31,610 --> 00:48:33,610]  So if you look at this as a broad category,\n",
            "[00:48:33,610 --> 00:48:36,610]  and I could say, well, this one will become bigger.\n",
            "[00:48:36,610 --> 00:48:40,610]  So, for example, like our project with Talian City,\n",
            "[00:48:40,610 --> 00:48:44,610]  where we deployed 80,000 smart tree lights,\n",
            "[00:48:44,610 --> 00:48:49,610]  that's a big, like a $2.4 billion kind of project,\n",
            "[00:48:49,610 --> 00:48:51,610]  and then that counts as IoT.\n",
            "[00:48:51,610 --> 00:48:56,470]  So if you look at those projects like that, it will be the category.\n",
            "[00:48:56,470 --> 00:49:03,470]  Now, security, the IT security is something like a solution or software-based,\n",
            "[00:49:03,470 --> 00:49:06,470]  and then it tends not to be big dollars.\n",
            "[00:49:06,470 --> 00:49:08,470]  But then you see more needs,\n",
            "[00:49:08,470 --> 00:49:12,080]  they will know that they need the IT security.\n",
            "[00:49:12,080 --> 00:49:16,080]  But then the amount itself per project is not big.\n",
            "[00:49:16,080 --> 00:49:20,080]  So they do not add up as big as the IoT category,\n",
            "[00:49:20,080 --> 00:49:23,080]  just because it has a big variety.\n",
            "[00:49:23,080 --> 00:49:27,080]  And depending on, you know, the smart city or smart manufacturing,\n",
            "[00:49:27,080 --> 00:49:29,080]  you know, so it can vary.\n",
            "[00:49:29,080 --> 00:49:35,080]  But then if you must have an answer, I'll tell you that's IoT.\n",
            "[00:49:35,080 --> 00:49:37,080]  Got it, got it, thank you.\n",
            "[00:49:37,080 --> 00:49:41,080]  And then just a quick follow-up, as you mentioned previously,\n",
            "[00:49:41,080 --> 00:49:43,080]  how about the verticals, the industry verticals?\n",
            "[00:49:43,080 --> 00:49:49,080]  So it seems like initially the projects will monthly come from public sectors\n",
            "[00:49:49,080 --> 00:49:52,080]  or something else?\n",
            "[00:49:52,080 --> 00:49:53,080]  Okay.\n",
            "[00:49:53,080 --> 00:49:57,080]  Well, I wasn't offering that.\n",
            "[00:49:57,080 --> 00:49:59,080]  Just for my two cents.\n",
            "[00:49:59,080 --> 00:50:02,080]  From what we've seen, right,\n",
            "[00:50:03,080 --> 00:50:06,430]  I cannot, I have to say, you know,\n",
            "[00:50:06,430 --> 00:50:11,430]  with one of our peers is kind of an incumbent in the government sector\n",
            "[00:50:11,430 --> 00:50:12,430]  because of the history,\n",
            "[00:50:12,430 --> 00:50:15,430]  because they are halfway or mostly government-owned.\n",
            "[00:50:15,430 --> 00:50:19,430]  So they do have an advantage with the government sector.\n",
            "[00:50:19,430 --> 00:50:22,430]  But then I do see the growth in government\n",
            "[00:50:22,430 --> 00:50:27,430]  because a lot of these smart projects are really driven by the government,\n",
            "[00:50:27,430 --> 00:50:29,430]  local government as well, right?\n",
            "[00:50:29,430 --> 00:50:32,430]  So the smart city, that's why I said the smart city,\n",
            "[00:50:32,430 --> 00:50:37,430]  continues to be a big area that we will invest in.\n",
            "[00:50:37,430 --> 00:50:41,430]  And then, you know, but we have done some, you know, really good jobs.\n",
            "[00:50:41,430 --> 00:50:45,430]  So once we were given the opportunity to show that we can compete,\n",
            "[00:50:45,430 --> 00:50:48,430]  we do have some good wins over our peers.\n",
            "[00:50:48,430 --> 00:50:51,430]  So, and then actually Mount Telco, I think,\n",
            "[00:50:51,430 --> 00:50:53,430]  Chung-Hwa and ourselves,\n",
            "[00:50:53,430 --> 00:50:56,430]  we probably are doing the best in the government area.\n",
            "[00:50:57,430 --> 00:51:01,430]  But then there's a lot more room, you know, for us to do more.\n",
            "[00:51:01,430 --> 00:51:04,430]  So I definitely see government as one area.\n",
            "[00:51:04,430 --> 00:51:11,430]  Now as far as the private sector, I think manufacturing will be one.\n",
            "[00:51:11,430 --> 00:51:16,430]  And then because of this industrial 4.0\n",
            "[00:51:16,430 --> 00:51:20,430]  and also quite a few companies coming back, right, from overseas.\n",
            "[00:51:20,430 --> 00:51:22,430]  They invest in Taiwan.\n",
            "[00:51:22,430 --> 00:51:23,430]  They build their factories.\n",
            "[00:51:23,430 --> 00:51:27,320]  So we see factories.\n",
            "[00:51:28,320 --> 00:51:33,320]  And then, but this is not to say with those other traditional industries\n",
            "[00:51:33,320 --> 00:51:35,320]  that you don't have opportunities.\n",
            "[00:51:35,320 --> 00:51:40,420]  Actually, they see the need for digital transformation,\n",
            "[00:51:40,420 --> 00:51:42,420]  especially with the pandemic.\n",
            "[00:51:42,420 --> 00:51:47,420]  They see how critical it is, you know, to have the digitalization\n",
            "[00:51:47,420 --> 00:51:50,420]  or go digital kind of a capability.\n",
            "[00:51:50,420 --> 00:51:54,420]  So there's definitely a surge in the need for cloud.\n",
            "[00:51:54,420 --> 00:51:57,420]  And then that is across many different verticals.\n",
            "[00:51:57,420 --> 00:52:04,690]  So we like to, you know, kind of focus on the top,\n",
            "[00:52:04,690 --> 00:52:08,690]  whichever industry that could benefit from these solutions.\n",
            "[00:52:08,690 --> 00:52:14,170]  So we see quite a few of them, yeah.\n",
            "[00:52:14,170 --> 00:52:17,170]  And retailing, that's another area.\n",
            "[00:52:17,170 --> 00:52:21,170]  It's definitely healthcare, like what we are doing with telemedicine.\n",
            "[00:52:21,170 --> 00:52:24,170]  But then back to this, the government thing.\n",
            "[00:52:24,170 --> 00:52:27,170]  Telemedicine has a lot to do with our current regulation.\n",
            "[00:52:27,170 --> 00:52:32,170]  So government definitely plays a key role there as to how much growth\n",
            "[00:52:32,170 --> 00:52:35,170]  that we think we will be able to move this forward.\n",
            "[00:52:35,170 --> 00:52:39,170]  But then I'm glad to say that right now from all those progress that has been\n",
            "[00:52:39,170 --> 00:52:45,170]  made in the regulation in terms of opening up for more patients qualified\n",
            "[00:52:45,170 --> 00:52:50,170]  to be reimbursed for their insurance coverage for telemedicine,\n",
            "[00:52:50,170 --> 00:52:52,170]  that is opening up.\n",
            "[00:52:52,170 --> 00:52:57,670]  So we definitely see more opportunities there for growth as well.\n",
            "[00:52:57,670 --> 00:52:58,670]  Got it.\n",
            "[00:52:58,670 --> 00:53:00,090]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:53:00,090 --> 00:53:04,450]  Sure.\n",
            "[00:53:04,450 --> 00:53:05,450]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:53:05,450 --> 00:53:07,450]  Ladies and gentlemen, there are currently no questions.\n",
            "[00:53:07,450 --> 00:53:09,450]  I'll pass the call back to Mr. Gary Lai.\n",
            "[00:53:09,450 --> 00:53:10,450]  And Gary, please proceed.\n",

            "[00:53:21,380 --> 00:53:25,180]  And if you have more questions that we were not able to get to,\n",

            "[00:53:28,180 --> 00:53:33,180]  And as you see that FET is very committed to growing our business\n",
            "[00:53:33,180 --> 00:53:37,180]  and very committed to our investors and our shareholders.\n",
            "[00:53:37,180 --> 00:53:40,180]  So we will continue to do good and do better.\n",

            "[00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:15,160]  So, in general, in terms of the mobile market in Taiwan, as we have seen over several quarters now,\n",
            "[00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:20,160]  the market has been stable in terms of the total number of subscribers.\n",
            "[00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:25,160]  And then, on the other hand, for the mobile number portability customers,\n",
            "[00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:32,160]  that means those customers that are available to shop around, the number has been decreasing.\n",
            "[00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:37,160]  And that means the market is relatively cold, which is good for competition.\n",
            "[00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:41,160]  That means it's not a heated market.\n",
            "[00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:48,160]  But then, despite all that, Far Eastone continues to have our post-paid subscribers.\n",
            "[00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:53,160]  We have been on the increasing mode for nine quarters in a row now.\n",
            "[00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:55,160]  So, we are pleased with that.\n",
            "[00:01:55,160 --> 00:02:00,160]  And then, also, the churn rate, we kept hitting the record low.\n",
            "[00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:11,540]  And, on the other hand, we remain the highest in our pool among our industry for 698 for post-paid.\n",
            "[00:02:11,540 --> 00:02:15,540]  And then, for our operational performance, we are glad to report,\n",
            "[00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:19,540]  even though we are seeing the impact of COVID-19,\n",
            "[00:02:19,540 --> 00:02:25,540]  we still reported a 17% year-over-year growth for the new economy.\n",
            "[00:02:25,540 --> 00:02:32,540]  And, in particular, some of the growth areas have recorded good growth for us.\n",
            "[00:02:32,540 --> 00:02:37,540]  And, for example, in the ICT area, we are seeing 31% of the year-over-year growth.\n",
            "[00:02:37,540 --> 00:02:45,540]  And then, IoT, which benefits from the big streetlight project that we had with a local government.\n",
            "[00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:50,540]  So, we are seeing a 249% of year-over-year growth.\n",
            "[00:02:50,540 --> 00:02:57,540]  And then, cloud service and also the mobile commerce and media sales also see a double-digit growth.\n",
            "[00:02:57,540 --> 00:03:04,400]  And then, in terms of the 5G, and everybody is very interested to learn more,\n",
            "[00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:17,400]  since the launch, we have, well, first of all, right now we have built 2,700 base stations for 5G in the 3.5G spectrum.\n",
            "[00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:23,400]  And then, we are following a big data and AI-recommended deployment strategy\n",
            "[00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:30,400]  so that we are not looking at a fast deployment or a high number of base stations\n",
            "[00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:33,400]  because we want to make sure we spend our capital very wisely.\n",
            "[00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:39,400]  And then, also, we are optimizing the network, the end-to-end network, that is 4G plus 5G,\n",
            "[00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:45,400]  as we build more 5G into the network so that we don't impact the customer's experience.\n",
            "[00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:52,400]  And then, better yet, with 5G, the new customers that are on 5G, they should have a much better experience.\n",
            "[00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:54,400]  So, that has been our strategy.\n",
            "[00:03:55,400 --> 00:04:03,690]  But then, we are on target to reach another 1,000 base stations by the end of the year.\n",
            "[00:04:03,690 --> 00:04:07,690]  In terms of our 5G adoption, it's going really strong.\n",
            "[00:04:07,690 --> 00:04:09,690]  We are very pleased to see that.\n",
            "[00:04:09,690 --> 00:04:20,690]  And 97% of the 5G customers that have signed up, they signed up for a rate plan that is 999 program or above.\n",
            "[00:04:20,690 --> 00:04:25,300]  And actually, half of it is for the 1399 and above.\n",
            "[00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:30,300]  And average monthly fee, therefore, for the new customers that we got,\n",
            "[00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:34,300]  and also for those that are up for renewed accounts,\n",
            "[00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:40,300]  we see a continuous uplift effect on our monthly fees from these conversions.\n",
            "[00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:45,840]  And then, as I mentioned earlier, we are really stressing on, in terms of our deployment,\n",
            "[00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:48,840]  that we can optimize our network as we go.\n",
            "[00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:54,840]  I think the strategy does work because it is reflected in our speed test results.\n",
            "[00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:58,840]  As it was reported by Commercial Times just recently,\n",
            "[00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:05,840]  the global 5G speed by OpenSignal, based on the October data,\n",
            "[00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:09,840]  Taiwan is actually ranked number four worldwide.\n",
            "[00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:13,840]  And then, the average speed for the download is 211.\n",
            "[00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:20,840]  And on the other hand, based on OpenSignal's data sources that we have for October,\n",
            "[00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:24,840]  FET's average download speed actually reached 343.\n",
            "[00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:29,280]  So, I think we are doing very, very well there.\n",
            "[00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:30,280]  All right.\n",
            "[00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:33,310]  And next is on the Far Eastern iPhone.\n",
            "[00:05:33,310 --> 00:05:36,310]  iPhone launched on October 23rd.\n",
            "[00:05:36,310 --> 00:05:40,310]  And for the first 10 days that the data we were looking at,\n",
            "[00:05:40,310 --> 00:05:47,310]  more than 60% of the iPhone seekers, they signed up for rate plan 1399 and above.\n",
            "[00:05:47,310 --> 00:05:53,310]  And altogether, for those that signed up for 999 and above, it's about 98%.\n",
            "[00:05:53,310 --> 00:05:56,310]  In other words, for those that came in for the new iPhones,\n",
            "[00:05:56,310 --> 00:06:02,410]  almost every one of them that signed up for 999 and above rate plan.\n",
            "[00:06:02,410 --> 00:06:03,410]  Okay.\n",
            "[00:06:03,410 --> 00:06:08,700]  And this is 85% a year ago.\n",
            "[00:06:08,700 --> 00:06:14,700]  And the most popular models are the iPhone 12 Pro, the Pacific Blue,\n",
            "[00:06:14,700 --> 00:06:21,380]  and then the iPhone 12 in Blue.\n",
            "[00:06:21,380 --> 00:06:29,200]  And with that, I'm going to pass this to Sharon to report to you the 3Q financial performance.\n",
            "[00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:30,200]  Thank you, President Qu.\n",
            "[00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:31,200]  Good afternoon, everyone.\n",
            "[00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:35,300]  Let me go through the financial performance for the Q3.\n",
            "[00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:40,390]  For Q3, total revenue is $18.6 billion, and it's divided by Q2.\n",
            "[00:06:40,390 --> 00:06:43,390]  Due to the weak handset sales and roaming service revenue\n",
            "[00:06:43,390 --> 00:06:47,550]  as a result of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n",
            "[00:06:47,550 --> 00:06:54,550]  Net income of the Q3 is $2.06 billion, which is impacted by the 5G spectrum implementation.\n",
            "[00:06:54,550 --> 00:07:01,640]  Moving to the next page, it shows our financial results comparing with our guidance.\n",
            "[00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:05,640]  The total revenue for Q3 is $18.6 billion.\n",
            "[00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:07,640]  The achievement rate is 86%.\n",
            "[00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:10,640]  Measure from the less handset sales.\n",
            "[00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:16,640]  With cultural spending, operating expense for the Q3 is $3.7 billion,\n",
            "[00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:19,670]  which is 11% lower than our guidance.\n",
            "[00:07:19,670 --> 00:07:24,670]  Q3 EBITDA is $6.8 billion, slightly lower than our guidance\n",
            "[00:07:24,670 --> 00:07:28,700]  due to lower revenue from the handset sales and the roaming services.\n",
            "[00:07:28,700 --> 00:07:34,700]  With lower funding cost and appreciation, Q3 net income is $2.06 billion,\n",
            "[00:07:34,700 --> 00:07:37,700]  which is 3.5% ahead of our guidance.\n",
            "[00:07:37,700 --> 00:07:42,060]  For the last three quarters, net income is $6.5 billion.\n",
            "[00:07:42,060 --> 00:07:45,060]  The achievement rate is 105%.\n",
            "[00:07:45,060 --> 00:07:49,060]  Earning per share for the three quarters is $1.99.\n",
            "[00:07:49,060 --> 00:07:52,220]  And I think it warrants some further clarification\n",
            "[00:07:52,220 --> 00:07:56,220]  for the relative low achievement rate for Q3\n",
            "[00:07:56,220 --> 00:08:00,220]  because September usually is where we target to have the iPhone launch.\n",
            "[00:08:00,220 --> 00:08:04,220]  And iPhone users is a big part of our total user base.\n",
            "[00:08:04,220 --> 00:08:09,400]  So with that, that costs some of this expenditure revenue.\n",
            "[00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:10,400]  Okay, thank you.\n",
            "[00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:14,400]  Please turn to the next page for the Q3 key financial indicators.\n",
            "[00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:19,260]  At the end of the Q3, the ending cash is $4.4 billion.\n",
            "[00:08:19,260 --> 00:08:22,260]  The total borrowing is about $73 billion.\n",
            "[00:08:22,260 --> 00:08:25,260]  Net debt is $67.5 billion.\n",
            "[00:08:25,260 --> 00:08:27,260]  Net debt to the EBITDA is $2.5 billion.\n",

            "[00:08:32,580 --> 00:08:35,930]  Cash can pass at $5.6 billion.\n",
            "[00:08:35,930 --> 00:08:37,930]  This financial year will keep the portfolio.\n",
            "[00:08:37,930 --> 00:08:41,930]  We expect $10 billion for the four-year cash cap\n",
            "[00:08:41,930 --> 00:08:45,180]  will be maintained here.\n",
            "[00:08:45,180 --> 00:08:47,180]  Let me turn the presentation to the President-in-Chief\n",
            "[00:08:47,180 --> 00:08:49,460]  for the business update.\n",
            "[00:08:49,460 --> 00:08:51,460]  Okay, thank you, Sharon.\n",
            "[00:08:51,460 --> 00:08:53,460]  Yeah, as we had our board meeting today,\n",
            "[00:08:53,460 --> 00:08:57,460]  which proves our further cooperation with APT,\n",
            "[00:08:57,460 --> 00:09:02,460]  and I'm sure many of you are very interested in more of those details.\n",
            "[00:09:02,460 --> 00:09:05,460]  So allow me to elaborate on that.\n",
            "[00:09:05,460 --> 00:09:08,460]  So the two conditions we have put out, that is, of course,\n",
            "[00:09:08,460 --> 00:09:14,460]  everything is subject to the appropriate government agency approval\n",
            "[00:09:14,460 --> 00:09:16,460]  before any of this can be realized.\n",
            "[00:09:16,460 --> 00:09:23,460]  But then the plan of the cooperation is to have 700 MHz spectrum sharing.\n",
            "[00:09:23,460 --> 00:09:28,460]  Both of us, APT has right now like a 15 MHz,\n",
            "[00:09:28,460 --> 00:09:31,460]  and for our eStone, we have 10.\n",
            "[00:09:32,460 --> 00:09:35,460]  So we are looking to share that spectrum as well.\n",
            "[00:09:35,460 --> 00:09:39,460]  That is in addition to the 3.5G for the 5G sharing.\n",
            "[00:09:39,460 --> 00:09:45,460]  But then, of course, this is not currently the policy of the government or NCC,\n",
            "[00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:49,460]  so that would wait for further change on the regulation part\n",
            "[00:09:49,460 --> 00:09:51,460]  before we will take any action.\n",
            "[00:09:51,460 --> 00:09:54,460]  But that is the plan for cooperation once that is allowed.\n",
            "[00:09:54,460 --> 00:10:01,460]  And then also we could swap our 2.G CDD spectrum\n",
            "[00:10:01,460 --> 00:10:05,460]  with APT's 5 MHz of 700 MHz spectrum.\n",
            "[00:10:05,460 --> 00:10:10,460]  And then so the cost sharing of this 700 MHz will,\n",
            "[00:10:10,460 --> 00:10:15,460]  based on the same kind of split rule that we reported in our last meeting\n",
            "[00:10:15,460 --> 00:10:19,460]  for you guys when we announced our cooperation arrangement,\n",
            "[00:10:19,460 --> 00:10:25,460]  so that is the 2.9 and 7.9 split for APT and FET respectively.\n",
            "[00:10:25,460 --> 00:10:31,460]  And if the authority approves this 700 MHz spectrum sharing earlier\n",
            "[00:10:31,460 --> 00:10:34,460]  than the spectrum swap execution date,\n",
            "[00:10:34,460 --> 00:10:39,460]  the spectrum swap agreement will be automatically terminated.\n",
            "[00:10:39,460 --> 00:10:41,460]  So there is some time sequence there.\n",
            "[00:10:41,460 --> 00:10:45,460]  And then the transaction is subject to approvals of relevant authorities,\n",
            "[00:10:45,460 --> 00:10:47,460]  as I mentioned.\n",
            "[00:10:47,460 --> 00:10:52,460]  And here we put together our spectrum kind of a layout,\n",
            "[00:10:52,460 --> 00:10:54,460]  so that gives you some better idea.\n",
            "[00:10:54,460 --> 00:10:57,460]  As you can see at the 700 area,\n",
            "[00:10:57,460 --> 00:11:03,460]  FET is right between APT's two spectrum segments in the 700.\n",
            "[00:11:03,460 --> 00:11:05,460]  So we are right in the middle of it.\n",
            "[00:11:05,460 --> 00:11:07,460]  And then if we can share the spectrum,\n",
            "[00:11:07,460 --> 00:11:13,460]  that will give the both of us a 25 MHz wide of a spectrum.\n",
            "[00:11:13,460 --> 00:11:17,460]  And that is very useful and very efficient\n",
            "[00:11:17,460 --> 00:11:19,460]  to improve our network performance,\n",
            "[00:11:19,460 --> 00:11:23,460]  not only for the 4G and also the 5G when we reform it,\n",
            "[00:11:23,460 --> 00:11:26,460]  and then for indoor penetration.\n",
            "[00:11:26,460 --> 00:11:30,460]  So this will be a very powerful spectrum bandwidth\n",
            "[00:11:30,460 --> 00:11:36,460]  for adding to our already premium spectrum for 5G.\n",
            "[00:11:36,460 --> 00:11:41,460]  And then if that spectrum sharing is not available yet\n",
            "[00:11:41,460 --> 00:11:46,460]  and then we have 2600 that we are currently not really utilizing,\n",
            "[00:11:46,460 --> 00:11:53,460]  and we could do a trade for 5 MHz of APT spectrum in 700.\n",
            "[00:11:53,460 --> 00:11:59,460]  So that is either or condition can help fulfill some more efficiency\n",
            "[00:11:59,460 --> 00:12:01,460]  in sharing the spectrum.\n",
            "[00:12:01,460 --> 00:12:04,350]  All right.\n",
            "[00:12:04,350 --> 00:12:06,350]  I'm sure you will have some questions later,\n",
            "[00:12:06,350 --> 00:12:08,350]  and we'll wait then.\n",
            "[00:12:08,350 --> 00:12:11,350]  And then next I'd like to just mention\n",
            "[00:12:11,350 --> 00:12:14,350]  we have several new consumer services\n",
            "[00:12:14,350 --> 00:12:18,350]  that were introduced in the third quarter.\n",
            "[00:12:18,350 --> 00:12:20,350]  So on the left-hand side,\n",
            "[00:12:20,350 --> 00:12:24,350]  that's really a transformation of our telecom business model.\n",
            "[00:12:24,350 --> 00:12:26,350]  As you know, in the telecom,\n",
            "[00:12:26,350 --> 00:12:31,350]  there are probably two major ways when we talk about a competition.\n",
            "[00:12:31,350 --> 00:12:33,350]  And one, we call them the front door.\n",
            "[00:12:33,350 --> 00:12:34,350]  One is the back door.\n",
            "[00:12:34,350 --> 00:12:36,350]  So you want to retain your customers\n",
            "[00:12:36,350 --> 00:12:40,350]  once they get into your account.\n",
            "[00:12:40,350 --> 00:12:43,350]  So you want to keep the back door closed\n",
            "[00:12:43,350 --> 00:12:46,350]  so they just won't leave, and that's the retention.\n",
            "[00:12:46,350 --> 00:12:47,350]  And on the other hand,\n",
            "[00:12:47,350 --> 00:12:50,350]  you want to get out or you want more new customers to come in,\n",
            "[00:12:50,350 --> 00:12:53,350]  and that's the GA usually, what we are referring to.\n",
            "[00:12:53,350 --> 00:12:58,350]  But then with the market has been pretty stable or pretty cold.\n",
            "[00:12:58,350 --> 00:13:04,350]  So what we are changing here is using the power of platform\n",
            "[00:13:04,350 --> 00:13:06,350]  and then also the alliance.\n",
            "[00:13:06,350 --> 00:13:09,350]  So instead of waiting for some interested customers\n",
            "[00:13:09,350 --> 00:13:13,350]  that are non-FET customers that may come in or come by\n",
            "[00:13:13,350 --> 00:13:16,350]  or stop by our stores once in the blue month, right,\n",
            "[00:13:16,350 --> 00:13:19,350]  and then we aggressively go out there\n",
            "[00:13:19,350 --> 00:13:21,350]  to meet our potential customers out there,\n",
            "[00:13:21,350 --> 00:13:25,350]  whatever, you know, favorite shops they may be visiting\n",
            "[00:13:25,350 --> 00:13:30,350]  or whatever, you know, favorite service they may have.\n",
            "[00:13:30,350 --> 00:13:33,350]  And then we will provide, we will offer, you know,\n",
            "[00:13:33,350 --> 00:13:37,350]  our bundle service and we provide some discounts\n",
            "[00:13:37,350 --> 00:13:41,350]  so they can actually just by applying for a new account\n",
            "[00:13:41,350 --> 00:13:43,350]  or a new number with Far East,\n",
            "[00:13:43,350 --> 00:13:45,350]  they will sign up for one of our rate plans\n",
            "[00:13:45,350 --> 00:13:49,350]  and they get this subsidy for whatever, you know,\n",
            "[00:13:49,350 --> 00:13:52,350]  other service they were going to buy or pay for otherwise.\n",
            "[00:13:52,350 --> 00:13:57,350]  So we have, as we launched this just last week,\n",
            "[00:13:57,350 --> 00:14:01,350]  and then we have already 50 vendors\n",
            "[00:14:01,350 --> 00:14:03,350]  or partners that started with.\n",
            "[00:14:03,350 --> 00:14:05,350]  So this was very popular.\n",
            "[00:14:05,350 --> 00:14:07,350]  And actually right after we launched it\n",
            "[00:14:07,350 --> 00:14:09,350]  and we had a news conference,\n",
            "[00:14:09,350 --> 00:14:14,350]  we got a lot more interest parties and inquiries.\n",
            "[00:14:14,350 --> 00:14:19,350]  So we are very happy that many people see the potential\n",
            "[00:14:19,350 --> 00:14:23,350]  with this platform-driven and alliance-driven,\n",
            "[00:14:23,350 --> 00:14:25,350]  the new way of doing the business.\n",
            "[00:14:25,350 --> 00:14:27,350]  So we don't wait in our stores,\n",
            "[00:14:27,350 --> 00:14:30,350]  but then we go out and meet our potential customers\n",
            "[00:14:30,350 --> 00:14:32,350]  wherever they may be, okay.\n",
            "[00:14:32,350 --> 00:14:34,350]  And that is the new business model\n",
            "[00:14:34,350 --> 00:14:38,350]  and it's online merged with offline kind of a platform.\n",
            "[00:14:38,350 --> 00:14:40,350]  And then behind the scenes, of course,\n",
            "[00:14:40,350 --> 00:14:43,350]  there has to be some system work that needs to be done\n",
            "[00:14:43,350 --> 00:14:46,350]  and that's what we have done in the past few months\n",
            "[00:14:46,350 --> 00:14:48,350]  to get this ready and then launched in time.\n",
            "[00:14:48,350 --> 00:14:51,350]  So we are pleased to announce that and share that with you.\n",
            "[00:14:51,350 --> 00:14:54,350]  And on the right-hand side, that is the cloud gaming service,\n",
            "[00:14:54,350 --> 00:14:56,350]  which we just launched the other day.\n",
            "[00:14:56,350 --> 00:15:00,350]  This is one of the last highlights\n",
            "[00:15:00,350 --> 00:15:02,350]  of the new 5G services.\n",
            "[00:15:02,350 --> 00:15:05,350]  When we first started at the launch,\n",
            "[00:15:05,350 --> 00:15:07,350]  we had a 5G launch,\n",
            "[00:15:07,350 --> 00:15:11,350]  we mentioned there are six highlights of new 5G services\n",
            "[00:15:11,350 --> 00:15:13,350]  and that includes the VR, the multi-view,\n",
            "[00:15:13,350 --> 00:15:16,350]  the 4K and 8K resolution,\n",
            "[00:15:16,350 --> 00:15:19,350]  and then also the home theater.\n",
            "[00:15:19,350 --> 00:15:21,350]  And this gaming is the sixth,\n",
            "[00:15:21,350 --> 00:15:23,350]  and the last but not least.\n",
            "[00:15:23,350 --> 00:15:27,350]  And we cooperated with Ubitis,\n",
            "[00:15:27,350 --> 00:15:31,350]  which was the Taiwan's company,\n",
            "[00:15:31,350 --> 00:15:34,350]  but then really got a lot of fame and success internationally.\n",
            "[00:15:34,350 --> 00:15:37,350]  And they are very innovative.\n",
            "[00:15:37,350 --> 00:15:42,350]  So we are very happy with the cooperation opportunity with them.\n",
            "[00:15:42,350 --> 00:15:47,350]  And we are looking to kind of get this cloud gaming business\n",
            "[00:15:47,350 --> 00:15:51,350]  into or to become a new blue ocean.\n",
            "[00:15:51,350 --> 00:15:53,350]  And this is not only adding\n",
            "[00:15:53,350 --> 00:15:56,350]  to one of our consumer digital services,\n",
            "[00:15:56,350 --> 00:15:58,350]  but then we also see its potential\n",
            "[00:15:58,350 --> 00:16:02,900]  to grow even more in the future.\n",
            "[00:16:02,900 --> 00:16:05,380]  And then on the enterprise side,\n",
            "[00:16:05,380 --> 00:16:08,380]  you know, one thing in particular\n",
            "[00:16:08,380 --> 00:16:10,380]  I think we have done very well\n",
            "[00:16:10,380 --> 00:16:14,380]  is we use the 5G to provide this telemedicine service.\n",
            "[00:16:14,380 --> 00:16:17,380]  And that is not some just PLC,\n",
            "[00:16:17,380 --> 00:16:19,380]  it is actually already in works, right?\n",
            "[00:16:19,380 --> 00:16:21,380]  It is already working\n",
            "[00:16:21,380 --> 00:16:28,380]  and we applied it with Taitung government.\n",
            "[00:16:28,380 --> 00:16:32,380]  And this is helping the far-to-reach\n",
            "[00:16:32,380 --> 00:16:35,380]  suburb areas residents\n",
            "[00:16:35,380 --> 00:16:39,380]  where the medical resources was just really scarce, right?\n",
            "[00:16:39,380 --> 00:16:41,380]  So we are using the internet\n",
            "[00:16:41,380 --> 00:16:44,380]  or using our network to replace the road\n",
            "[00:16:44,380 --> 00:16:47,380]  that otherwise they will have to travel\n",
            "[00:16:47,380 --> 00:16:49,380]  in order to have access\n",
            "[00:16:49,380 --> 00:16:52,380]  to sufficient or adequate medical resources.\n",
            "[00:16:52,380 --> 00:16:55,380]  And with this telemedicine,\n",
            "[00:16:55,380 --> 00:17:00,380]  so we have set up a platform on the tablet\n",
            "[00:17:00,380 --> 00:17:03,380]  so the doctors at the far end\n",
            "[00:17:03,380 --> 00:17:06,380]  and then local health center\n",
            "[00:17:06,380 --> 00:17:09,380]  and where the patient is or may be\n",
            "[00:17:09,380 --> 00:17:12,380]  and they can have some measures done locally\n",
            "[00:17:12,380 --> 00:17:16,380]  and then those images can be transmitted in real time\n",
            "[00:17:16,380 --> 00:17:20,380]  because the 5G very low latency and big bandwidth.\n",
            "[00:17:20,380 --> 00:17:23,380]  So all that can be transmitted in real time\n",
            "[00:17:23,380 --> 00:17:27,380]  and the far-end doctors can actually see it very closely\n",
            "[00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:30,380]  just as if they were right there together.\n",
            "[00:17:30,380 --> 00:17:32,380]  And this helps tremendously\n",
            "[00:17:32,380 --> 00:17:36,380]  because this kind of model has been trialed before with 4G\n",
            "[00:17:36,380 --> 00:17:39,380]  but then just because of the bandwidth limitation\n",
            "[00:17:39,380 --> 00:17:41,380]  and also the latency limitation.\n",
            "[00:17:41,380 --> 00:17:43,380]  So it just wasn't very good\n",
            "[00:17:43,380 --> 00:17:45,380]  and not good enough for real practice.\n",
            "[00:17:45,380 --> 00:17:48,380]  But then we are glad that we were the first\n",
            "[00:17:48,380 --> 00:17:53,380]  to provide this service with our partners hospitals\n",
            "[00:17:55,380 --> 00:17:59,380]  and also this was funded by the government\n",
            "[00:17:59,380 --> 00:18:01,380]  as the initial program.\n",
            "[00:18:01,380 --> 00:18:04,380]  And then we definitely see the success there\n",
            "[00:18:04,380 --> 00:18:07,380]  and then also more of the local governments\n",
            "[00:18:07,380 --> 00:18:09,380]  are reaching out to us.\n",
            "[00:18:09,380 --> 00:18:14,380]  So there are a couple more contracting in the works.\n",
            "[00:18:14,380 --> 00:18:16,380]  But then most importantly,\n",
            "[00:18:16,380 --> 00:18:20,380]  aside from this is another new 5G application\n",
            "[00:18:20,380 --> 00:18:22,380]  that we also see the benefit\n",
            "[00:18:22,380 --> 00:18:26,380]  that we really can see that is bringing to the community\n",
            "[00:18:26,380 --> 00:18:29,380]  especially to those underprivileged people.\n",
            "[00:18:29,380 --> 00:18:34,540]  So we are glad that we are one of the first in Taiwan\n",
            "[00:18:34,540 --> 00:18:36,540]  that is able to do that.\n",
            "[00:18:36,540 --> 00:18:39,570]  Okay, and there are some additional third quarter highlights\n",
            "[00:18:39,570 --> 00:18:41,570]  that we'd like to share with you all\n",
            "[00:18:41,570 --> 00:18:44,570]  and we signed a MOU with Kaohsiung City Government\n",
            "[00:18:44,570 --> 00:18:46,570]  on the 5G Smart City.\n",

            "[00:18:54,570 --> 00:18:57,570]  So he has laid out his vision for it\n",
            "[00:18:57,570 --> 00:18:59,570]  and we are very happy and honored\n",
            "[00:18:59,570 --> 00:19:02,570]  that he asked Far Eastone to be his partner\n",
            "[00:19:02,570 --> 00:19:05,570]  to participate in this big project.\n",
            "[00:19:05,570 --> 00:19:09,570]  And then we also won several awards.\n",
            "[00:19:09,570 --> 00:19:10,570]  And then for example,\n",
            "[00:19:10,570 --> 00:19:13,570]  the 2020 Customer Service Excellence Award\n",
            "[00:19:13,570 --> 00:19:17,570]  from Taiwan Contact Center Development Association.\n",

            "[00:19:29,570 --> 00:19:31,570]  So there are quite a few of them\n",
            "[00:19:31,570 --> 00:19:33,570]  and then they are not our KPIs\n",
            "[00:19:33,570 --> 00:19:36,570]  and it's just something I think we just do\n",
            "[00:19:36,570 --> 00:19:38,570]  continue to focus on our business\n",
            "[00:19:38,570 --> 00:19:40,570]  but then we get recognized and we appreciate that\n",
            "[00:19:40,570 --> 00:19:43,570]  and we'd like to share those with you all.\n",
            "[00:19:43,570 --> 00:19:46,570]  And then lastly,\n",
            "[00:19:46,570 --> 00:19:49,570]  in terms of the fourth quarter focus for FET,\n",
            "[00:19:49,570 --> 00:19:53,570]  of course we will continue with the steady 5G deployment\n",
            "[00:19:53,570 --> 00:19:57,570]  and we are still targeting at 4,000 BTS\n",
            "[00:19:57,570 --> 00:19:59,570]  before the end of the year.\n",
            "[00:19:59,570 --> 00:20:01,570]  And then on the consumer side,\n",
            "[00:20:01,570 --> 00:20:04,570]  we will accelerate the 5G adoption.\n",
            "[00:20:04,570 --> 00:20:07,570]  Even though we are pleased with what we see now,\n",
            "[00:20:07,570 --> 00:20:11,570]  of course we definitely see we're ahead of our target.\n",
            "[00:20:11,570 --> 00:20:13,570]  So by the end of the year,\n",
            "[00:20:13,570 --> 00:20:18,570]  we have set a target for 300,000 subscribers\n",
            "[00:20:18,570 --> 00:20:20,570]  or 5G subscribers.\n",
            "[00:20:20,570 --> 00:20:24,570]  And then we're saying we should be able to achieve that\n",
            "[00:20:24,570 --> 00:20:26,570]  before the end of the year.\n",
            "[00:20:26,570 --> 00:20:29,570]  And then we will also promote those new services\n",
            "[00:20:29,570 --> 00:20:31,570]  that we have provided since the launch\n",
            "[00:20:31,570 --> 00:20:34,570]  and also just recently the gaming.\n",
            "[00:20:35,570 --> 00:20:38,570]  And then we are going to have a soft launch\n",
            "[00:20:38,570 --> 00:20:40,570]  on another new model.\n",
            "[00:20:40,570 --> 00:20:42,570]  And as I mentioned earlier,\n",
            "[00:20:42,570 --> 00:20:45,570]  for a telecom, we really want to refocus\n",
            "[00:20:45,570 --> 00:20:48,570]  on our telecom business.\n",
            "[00:20:48,570 --> 00:20:52,570]  In terms of the GA and then that is the\n",
            "[00:20:52,570 --> 00:20:56,570]  we shop, we pay model.\n",
            "[00:20:56,570 --> 00:20:58,570]  But then for the retention,\n",
            "[00:20:58,570 --> 00:21:01,570]  we want to build a member economy\n",
            "[00:21:01,570 --> 00:21:03,570]  with this mobile circle.\n",
            "[00:21:03,570 --> 00:21:06,570]  So this is to help us retain more customers\n",
            "[00:21:06,570 --> 00:21:08,570]  and then even less churn.\n",
            "[00:21:08,570 --> 00:21:10,570]  And also at the same time,\n",
            "[00:21:10,570 --> 00:21:13,570]  provide more values for our customers.\n",
            "[00:21:13,570 --> 00:21:17,570]  And then also looking to bigger contributions\n",
            "[00:21:17,570 --> 00:21:19,570]  from our loyal customers as well.\n",
            "[00:21:19,570 --> 00:21:23,570]  More details will be available in the first quarter\n",
            "[00:21:23,570 --> 00:21:24,570]  or January.\n",
            "[00:21:24,570 --> 00:21:27,570]  We plan to have a news release on that.\n",
            "[00:21:27,570 --> 00:21:29,570]  But then in the fourth quarter,\n",
            "[00:21:29,570 --> 00:21:31,570]  we are doing the soft launch.\n",
            "[00:21:32,570 --> 00:21:35,570]  And then on the enterprise business side,\n",
            "[00:21:35,570 --> 00:21:38,570]  we want to continue to increase our participation\n",
            "[00:21:38,570 --> 00:21:41,570]  in all these government projects\n",
            "[00:21:41,570 --> 00:21:43,570]  and then increase our market share\n",
            "[00:21:43,570 --> 00:21:45,570]  and presence in smart city.\n",
            "[00:21:45,570 --> 00:21:49,570]  And then smart manufacturing and smart telemedicine.\n",

            "[00:24:18,270 --> 00:24:21,430]  And then just in terms of promotions,\n",

            "[00:24:23,430 --> 00:24:27,430]  of less of the lowering promotions than previously\n",
            "[00:24:27,430 --> 00:24:30,430]  or are they just as prevalent as they were\n",
            "[00:24:30,430 --> 00:24:32,430]  but we're just seeing people wanting\n",
            "[00:24:32,430 --> 00:24:35,430]  to go onto 5G plans instead?\n",

            "[00:24:48,260 --> 00:24:49,260]  was that your question about?\n",
            "[00:24:49,260 --> 00:24:50,260]  Would you repeat it?\n",
            "[00:24:50,260 --> 00:24:51,260]  Yes.\n",
            "[00:24:51,260 --> 00:24:52,260]  Yeah, exactly.\n",
            "[00:24:52,260 --> 00:24:53,260]  So that's what you're asking?\n",
            "[00:24:53,260 --> 00:24:55,260]  Yes.\n",
            "[00:24:56,260 --> 00:24:59,480]  Right, so with 5G, right,\n",
            "[00:24:59,480 --> 00:25:01,480]  and then if you think about it,\n",
            "[00:25:01,480 --> 00:25:04,480]  what 5G for most of the consumers,\n",
            "[00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:06,480]  where they will feel the big difference\n",
            "[00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:08,480]  right away is the speed, right?\n",
            "[00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:11,480]  And then also the data, right?\n",
            "[00:25:11,480 --> 00:25:15,480]  So the higher rate plan will give them like a,\n",
            "[00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:20,480]  for example, our 999 per month data plan\n",
            "[00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:25,480]  actually will give them 60G of data usage per month.\n",
            "[00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:31,480]  So for anyone that is going to utilize 5G\n",
            "[00:25:31,480 --> 00:25:33,480]  for the speed and for the data,\n",
            "[00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:37,480]  the data usage they may anticipate,\n",
            "[00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:39,480]  then have the higher rate data plan\n",
            "[00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:42,480]  is certainly what they would want.\n",
            "[00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:46,480]  So we don't really need to promote or push\n",
            "[00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:49,480]  and it's just kind of like a make sense, right?\n",
            "[00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:53,480]  And then for the lower rate,\n",
            "[00:25:55,480 --> 00:25:56,480]  that is, I think,\n",
            "[00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:59,480]  I have to look at your target audience.\n",
            "[00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:03,480]  So we don't really need to push hard one way or the other.\n",
            "[00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:05,480]  It's just pretty natural\n",
            "[00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:08,480]  because for those who would like to try 5G,\n",
            "[00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:11,480]  they will want to have more data bandwidth.\n",
            "[00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:14,480]  And then so the higher rate plan actually fits them better.\n",
            "[00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:17,480]  And our unlimited data plan is 1399.\n",
            "[00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:18,480]  That is very good deal.\n",
            "[00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:19,480]  Okay, great.\n",
            "[00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:23,110]  I hope I answered your question.\n",
            "[00:26:23,110 --> 00:26:24,110]  Okay, take care.\n",
            "[00:26:24,110 --> 00:26:31,690]  And the next question is coming from Sarah Wong\n",
            "[00:26:31,690 --> 00:26:32,690]  of Morgan Stanley.\n",
            "[00:26:32,690 --> 00:26:33,690]  Go ahead, please.\n",
            "[00:26:33,690 --> 00:26:35,420]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:26:35,420 --> 00:26:37,420]  I have three questions.\n",
            "[00:26:37,420 --> 00:26:40,420]  So the first one is still on 5G.\n",
            "[00:26:40,420 --> 00:26:44,420]  So we have mentioned a lot of new 5G customers\n",
            "[00:26:44,420 --> 00:26:48,420]  sign up for over 999 plans.\n",
            "[00:26:48,420 --> 00:26:52,420]  So many ask if we see some internal upgrade,\n",
            "[00:26:53,420 --> 00:26:56,420]  what are their 4G plans before they upgrade?\n",
            "[00:26:56,420 --> 00:27:00,420]  Say, how much is the auto lift after they migrate to 5G?\n",
            "[00:27:00,420 --> 00:27:03,420]  And also, so far,\n",
            "[00:27:03,420 --> 00:27:06,420]  it seems still no killer application for 5G.\n",
            "[00:27:06,420 --> 00:27:09,420]  So are you concerned that initially\n",
            "[00:27:09,420 --> 00:27:11,420]  the 5G adoption momentum might be strong\n",
            "[00:27:11,420 --> 00:27:14,420]  because high-end users are upgrading,\n",
            "[00:27:14,420 --> 00:27:19,420]  but the upgrading cycle might be shorter\n",
            "[00:27:19,420 --> 00:27:21,420]  or weaker than 4G?\n",
            "[00:27:21,420 --> 00:27:23,420]  So this is my first question.\n",
            "[00:27:23,420 --> 00:27:28,420]  And then second question is on new economy business.\n",
            "[00:27:28,420 --> 00:27:31,420]  So in some of the slides mentioned\n",
            "[00:27:31,420 --> 00:27:34,420]  the growth was impacted by COVID-19.\n",
            "[00:27:34,420 --> 00:27:37,420]  So for the first three quarters in 2020,\n",
            "[00:27:37,420 --> 00:27:41,420]  is the growth in line with our expectations?\n",
            "[00:27:41,420 --> 00:27:43,420]  And also just a housekeeping question,\n",
            "[00:27:43,420 --> 00:27:47,420]  how much revenue as to percentage of total revenue\n",
            "[00:27:47,420 --> 00:27:50,460]  comes from this new economy business?\n",
            "[00:27:50,460 --> 00:27:52,460]  This is my second question.\n",
            "[00:27:52,460 --> 00:27:54,460]  And then on my third question,\n",
            "[00:27:54,460 --> 00:27:57,460]  so how's our CAPEX guidance for this year\n",
            "[00:27:57,460 --> 00:27:59,460]  or next year outlook?\n",
            "[00:27:59,460 --> 00:28:02,460]  So it seems Telemobile has reached their CAPEX guidance\n",
            "[00:28:02,460 --> 00:28:04,460]  for twice this year.\n",
            "[00:28:04,460 --> 00:28:08,460]  Do we see any pressure from this competition\n",
            "[00:28:08,460 --> 00:28:11,460]  to reach our CAPEX?\n",
            "[00:28:11,460 --> 00:28:12,490]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:28:12,490 --> 00:28:14,490]  All right, Sarah.\n",
            "[00:28:14,490 --> 00:28:16,490]  I'll answer your last question first.\n",
            "[00:28:16,490 --> 00:28:19,490]  Okay, so in terms of the CAPEX, right?\n",
            "[00:28:19,490 --> 00:28:22,490]  For this year, no, we are not under any pressure.\n",
            "[00:28:22,490 --> 00:28:25,490]  So as I mentioned, we will continue\n",
            "[00:28:25,490 --> 00:28:27,490]  with our steady deployment plan.\n",
            "[00:28:27,490 --> 00:28:30,490]  We don't have any plan to add more capital for it.\n",
            "[00:28:30,490 --> 00:28:35,710]  I think we use a very good strategy in our deployment.\n",
            "[00:28:35,710 --> 00:28:39,710]  That's why if you see in terms of number of base stations,\n",
            "[00:28:39,710 --> 00:28:42,710]  we may not have the highest numbers deployed by now,\n",
            "[00:28:42,710 --> 00:28:47,710]  but then you see we do have very, very good performance.\n",
            "[00:28:54,710 --> 00:28:56,710]  There's some noise on the line, Sarah.\n",
            "[00:28:56,710 --> 00:28:59,960]  I don't know if you hear it.\n",
            "[00:28:59,960 --> 00:29:00,960]  Yeah, that's because of me.\n",
            "[00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:02,960]  I just muted myself.\n",
            "[00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:05,380]  Okay, thank you.\n",
            "[00:29:05,380 --> 00:29:07,380]  All right, that is for this year.\n",
            "[00:29:07,380 --> 00:29:09,380]  And then as far as next year is concerned,\n",
            "[00:29:09,380 --> 00:29:13,380]  we are not at a time to really release any information yet.\n",
            "[00:29:13,380 --> 00:29:15,380]  That is still being worked.\n",
            "[00:29:15,380 --> 00:29:18,470]  Okay, and then your number two question\n",
            "[00:29:18,470 --> 00:29:20,470]  is regarding new economy.\n",
            "[00:29:20,470 --> 00:29:22,470]  Yeah, so for example,\n",
            "[00:29:22,470 --> 00:29:25,470]  we were looking at up to the third quarter,\n",
            "[00:29:25,470 --> 00:29:27,470]  it's a 17% growth,\n",
            "[00:29:27,470 --> 00:29:31,470]  but then our own BOD target was 23%.\n",
            "[00:29:31,470 --> 00:29:34,470]  So that is lower than our own BOD.\n",
            "[00:29:34,470 --> 00:29:38,470]  That's why before anybody knew about the pandemic,\n",
            "[00:29:38,470 --> 00:29:42,470]  we were very optimistic and also aggressive\n",
            "[00:29:42,470 --> 00:29:44,470]  in our targets.\n",
            "[00:29:44,470 --> 00:29:45,470]  So that was that.\n",
            "[00:29:45,470 --> 00:29:48,470]  And then for up to the third quarter,\n",
            "[00:29:48,470 --> 00:29:51,470]  the total new economy revenue accounts\n",
            "[00:29:51,470 --> 00:29:54,470]  for about 15% of our total revenue.\n",
            "[00:29:54,470 --> 00:29:59,760]  Okay, and then your first question is about the uplift,\n",
            "[00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:02,760]  like for the 4G and then all that.\n",
            "[00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:07,430]  So it's about 10% to 15% uplift.\n",
            "[00:30:07,430 --> 00:30:11,230]  There's a second part of your first question,\n",
            "[00:30:11,230 --> 00:30:13,230]  but I now forgot.\n",
            "[00:30:13,230 --> 00:30:16,260]  If you remember, you can repeat it for me, please.\n",
            "[00:30:16,260 --> 00:30:20,360]  Yeah, the second part of the question is just that\n",
            "[00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:23,360]  it seems to no cure application for 5G.\n",
            "[00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:26,360]  So are you concerned that,\n",
            "[00:30:26,360 --> 00:30:29,360]  well, the initial 5G momentum might be strong\n",
            "[00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:33,360]  because high end users might want to upgrade to 5G,\n",
            "[00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:37,360]  but do you think this momentum will be as sustained as 4G\n",
            "[00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:39,360]  or it might be weaker than 4G?\n",
            "[00:30:41,670 --> 00:30:45,670]  Well, I think because all these services,\n",
            "[00:30:45,670 --> 00:30:47,670]  just like a 5G, is new.\n",
            "[00:30:47,670 --> 00:30:52,670]  So these services will have better adoption\n",
            "[00:30:52,670 --> 00:30:54,670]  as the time goes.\n",
            "[00:30:54,670 --> 00:30:57,670]  And then there should be even newer services\n",
            "[00:30:57,670 --> 00:30:59,670]  or applications that become available.\n",
            "[00:30:59,670 --> 00:31:04,670]  So I think the picture will get better, you know.\n",
            "[00:31:04,670 --> 00:31:09,670]  And then I think on the different conference calls\n",
            "[00:31:09,670 --> 00:31:11,670]  I have made some comparisons.\n",
            "[00:31:11,670 --> 00:31:13,670]  When we deployed 4G in Taiwan,\n",
            "[00:31:13,670 --> 00:31:16,670]  it was kind of behind a lot of the countries.\n",
            "[00:31:16,670 --> 00:31:21,670]  And at that time, so we had a really fast penetration\n",
            "[00:31:21,670 --> 00:31:23,670]  or adoption in 4G,\n",
            "[00:31:23,670 --> 00:31:27,670]  and then that got us into a price competition very soon.\n",
            "[00:31:27,670 --> 00:31:29,670]  But then I think 5G is so new,\n",
            "[00:31:29,670 --> 00:31:31,670]  and then it's new for the world.\n",
            "[00:31:31,670 --> 00:31:34,670]  And then we, comparatively speaking,\n",
            "[00:31:34,670 --> 00:31:37,670]  we are lucky that we are not really impacted\n",
            "[00:31:37,670 --> 00:31:40,670]  as much by a pandemic like the rest of the world.\n",
            "[00:31:40,670 --> 00:31:43,670]  So the people are still warming up to 5G.\n",
            "[00:31:43,670 --> 00:31:45,670]  And so I do see, you know,\n",
            "[00:31:45,670 --> 00:31:49,670]  this will continue for a period of time, you know.\n",
            "[00:31:49,670 --> 00:31:52,670]  And then we like to see that.\n",
            "[00:31:52,670 --> 00:31:54,670]  So this is like a slow warming up.\n",
            "[00:31:54,670 --> 00:31:59,670]  But then even with what we, you know, have expected,\n",
            "[00:31:59,670 --> 00:32:02,670]  like I said, we're actually seeing better, you know,\n",
            "[00:32:02,670 --> 00:32:04,670]  outcomes than we expected.\n",
            "[00:32:04,670 --> 00:32:05,670]  So we like what we see.\n",
            "[00:32:05,670 --> 00:32:07,670]  And then we like it a little bit slower.\n",
            "[00:32:07,670 --> 00:32:10,670]  And so we don't need to get into, you know,\n",
            "[00:32:10,670 --> 00:32:14,670]  like a very fierce competition or price competition very soon.\n",
            "[00:32:14,670 --> 00:32:18,670]  And then I think also because the price that we have put out\n",
            "[00:32:18,670 --> 00:32:21,670]  are really reasonable for what the consumer would get.\n",
            "[00:32:21,670 --> 00:32:23,670]  So that's really a very good, you know,\n",
            "[00:32:23,670 --> 00:32:27,150]  CP value for the consumers.\n",
            "[00:32:27,150 --> 00:32:29,150]  Got it. That's really helpful. Thank you.\n",
            "[00:32:29,150 --> 00:32:30,150]  Sure.\n",
            "[00:32:30,150 --> 00:32:33,310]  As a reminder, please press 01 on your keypad\n",
            "[00:32:33,310 --> 00:32:35,310]  if you would like to ask a question.\n",
            "[00:32:35,310 --> 00:32:36,310]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:32:36,310 --> 00:32:39,310]  Ladies and gentlemen, we're now in question and answer session.\n",
            "[00:32:39,310 --> 00:32:41,310]  If you would like to ask a question,\n",
            "[00:32:41,310 --> 00:32:44,310]  please press 01 on your telephone keypad.\n",
            "[00:32:44,310 --> 00:32:45,310]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:32:45,310 --> 00:32:48,410]  And next we'll have Ryan Jin of UBS for questions.\n",
            "[00:32:48,410 --> 00:32:50,410]  Go ahead, please.\n",
            "[00:32:50,410 --> 00:32:53,340]  Hi. This is Ryan Jin from UBS.\n",
            "[00:32:53,340 --> 00:32:58,340]  I have a simple question on the 700 megahertz\n",
            "[00:32:58,340 --> 00:33:01,340]  spectrum sharing with APT.\n",
            "[00:33:01,340 --> 00:33:05,340]  Can you tell me if this is for 5G services\n",
            "[00:33:05,340 --> 00:33:11,340]  and if so, can you tell us what's the expected capex savings\n",
            "[00:33:11,340 --> 00:33:15,340]  from using 700 megahertz for 5G base stations?\n",
            "[00:33:15,340 --> 00:33:17,340]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:33:17,340 --> 00:33:19,260]  Okay.\n",
            "[00:33:19,260 --> 00:33:25,260]  So first of all, for the 700, when we do the 700 megahertz sharing,\n",
            "[00:33:25,260 --> 00:33:30,260]  it will be used for both 5G and 4G.\n",
            "[00:33:30,260 --> 00:33:33,260]  And then in terms of the capital savings,\n",
            "[00:33:34,260 --> 00:33:39,260]  because to do that, right, so there will be some upgrade needed\n",
            "[00:33:39,260 --> 00:33:46,260]  on the current 4G base stations that we use for 700 megahertz.\n",
            "[00:33:46,260 --> 00:33:49,260]  So all that capital that we would need,\n",
            "[00:33:49,260 --> 00:33:52,260]  well, then we will split the cost with APT.\n",
            "[00:33:52,260 --> 00:33:55,260]  I don't have an exact number because that really depends\n",
            "[00:33:55,260 --> 00:33:59,260]  on how many of the base stations we're going to upgrade the first year,\n",
            "[00:33:59,260 --> 00:34:01,260]  the second year, and all that.\n",
            "[00:34:01,260 --> 00:34:03,260]  So I don't have an exact number for you.\n",
            "[00:34:03,260 --> 00:34:05,900]  Got it.\n",
            "[00:34:05,900 --> 00:34:10,900]  So for the 4,000 base stations for this year\n",
            "[00:34:10,900 --> 00:34:14,900]  and then another thousands of base stations\n",
            "[00:34:14,900 --> 00:34:16,900]  that's going to be deployed next year,\n",
            "[00:34:16,900 --> 00:34:21,900]  it is safe to assume that those will be on 3.5 gigahertz?\n",
            "[00:34:21,900 --> 00:34:22,990]  Right.\n",
            "[00:34:22,990 --> 00:34:24,990]  So let me correct you, though.\n",
            "[00:34:24,990 --> 00:34:28,990]  When I said 1,000, it's like there's 1,000 more\n",
            "[00:34:28,990 --> 00:34:31,990]  that we will need to deploy by the end of the year.\n",
            "[00:34:31,990 --> 00:34:35,990]  So we'll reach about 4,000 for the 3.5G spectrum.\n",
            "[00:34:35,990 --> 00:34:36,990]  You're right.\n",
            "[00:34:36,990 --> 00:34:40,990]  And then for next year, right now, we are looking at about the same level\n",
            "[00:34:40,990 --> 00:34:44,990]  in terms of the number of base stations.\n",
            "[00:34:44,990 --> 00:34:49,990]  But then it really depends on how well the adoption goes, right?\n",
            "[00:34:49,990 --> 00:34:53,990]  So, you know, we may accelerate, but then we'll wait to see more.\n",
            "[00:34:53,990 --> 00:34:56,690]  All right.\n",
            "[00:34:56,690 --> 00:34:57,690]  Thank you very much.\n",
            "[00:34:57,690 --> 00:34:59,300]  Sure.\n",
            "[00:34:59,300 --> 00:35:08,320]  Now please press 01 on your keypad if you would like to ask a question.\n",
            "[00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:09,320]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:35:09,320 --> 00:35:13,990]  And the next question is coming from Sarah Wong of Morgan Stanley.\n",
            "[00:35:13,990 --> 00:35:14,990]  Go ahead, please.\n",
            "[00:35:14,990 --> 00:35:16,990]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:35:16,990 --> 00:35:20,990]  I have just one follow-up question on ICT\n",
            "[00:35:20,990 --> 00:35:23,990]  as it's outgrowing the traditional telecom business.\n",
            "[00:35:23,990 --> 00:35:26,990]  So just want to get more color on that.\n",
            "[00:35:26,990 --> 00:35:32,990]  So, for example, what's our view on our ICT business,\n",
            "[00:35:32,990 --> 00:35:35,990]  say, with the COVID still going on?\n",
            "[00:35:35,990 --> 00:35:40,990]  Do we see the growth to accelerate in next year or remain flat next year?\n",
            "[00:35:40,990 --> 00:35:45,990]  So how should we view this kind of business as it's more like a two-way business?\n",
            "[00:35:45,990 --> 00:35:52,990]  It's hard to estimate whether we can deliver our target or ambition.\n",
            "[00:35:52,990 --> 00:35:53,990]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:35:53,990 --> 00:35:55,600]  Okay.\n",
            "[00:35:55,600 --> 00:36:01,600]  So for the ICT, because of the 5G availability now,\n",
            "[00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:04,600]  and then we do see more opportunities\n",
            "[00:36:04,600 --> 00:36:08,600]  and also more solutions that will become available for ICT.\n",
            "[00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:14,600]  So I definitely see the growth opportunities get better and bigger because of the 5G.\n",
            "[00:36:14,600 --> 00:36:22,600]  Now how quickly and then how much that we can gain in the first few quarters\n",
            "[00:36:22,600 --> 00:36:26,600]  and all that, that needs to be further forecast.\n",
            "[00:36:26,600 --> 00:36:30,600]  But then I do see the growth just because of 5G\n",
            "[00:36:30,600 --> 00:36:34,600]  because, for example, a lot of those IoT applications\n",
            "[00:36:34,600 --> 00:36:38,600]  and even the telemedicine, as an example I mentioned,\n",
            "[00:36:38,600 --> 00:36:44,600]  it wasn't really quite there yet when it was tried with 4G.\n",
            "[00:36:44,600 --> 00:36:47,600]  But then now with 5G, that was no longer an issue.\n",
            "[00:36:47,600 --> 00:36:50,600]  And then actually with our success with the telemedicine,\n",
            "[00:36:50,600 --> 00:36:54,600]  we have doctors in the hospitals and ask us,\n",
            "[00:36:55,600 --> 00:37:01,600]  when we can do 5G, that is the tele-operating.\n",
            "[00:37:01,600 --> 00:37:06,600]  So people are wanting more and seeing the capability that 5G brings.\n",
            "[00:37:06,600 --> 00:37:11,600]  And then also other applications in smart manufacturing,\n",

            "[00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:21,600]  So this automation, this additional cloud business, right?\n",
            "[00:37:21,600 --> 00:37:26,600]  And then you send the cloud computing into the whole picture with 5G.\n",
            "[00:37:26,600 --> 00:37:27,600]  You can do that.\n",
            "[00:37:27,600 --> 00:37:31,600]  And then with the mobility introduced into your factories\n",
            "[00:37:31,600 --> 00:37:36,600]  and the factories become a lot more productive and because more flexibility.\n",
            "[00:37:36,600 --> 00:37:38,600]  So I do see, because of the 5G,\n",
            "[00:37:38,600 --> 00:37:43,600]  that it introduced much more applications and opportunities for growth.\n",
            "[00:37:43,600 --> 00:37:49,120]  And that is growth for us too.\n",
            "[00:37:49,120 --> 00:37:50,120]  Got it.\n",
            "[00:37:50,120 --> 00:37:53,120]  And then how's the margin for this business look like?\n",
            "[00:37:53,120 --> 00:37:56,120]  So I think maybe several conferences ago,\n",
            "[00:37:56,120 --> 00:38:02,120]  we have mentioned that EBITDA margin is like mid-teens, if I'm correct.\n",

            "[00:38:05,120 --> 00:38:09,600]  are we seeing the margin expanding or remaining stable?\n",
            "[00:38:09,600 --> 00:38:11,600]  I would say it's about the same.\n",
            "[00:38:11,600 --> 00:38:13,600]  And then with 5G, of course,\n",
            "[00:38:13,600 --> 00:38:19,600]  there is an additional layer as part of the solution, right?\n",

            "[00:38:24,600 --> 00:38:25,600]  if the client needs that,\n",
            "[00:38:25,600 --> 00:38:29,600]  that's an additional part of the solution kind of revenue\n",

            "[00:38:32,600 --> 00:38:36,600]  But then this private network solution, they will add to it.\n",

            "[00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:58,400]  and the mobile customers number, it actually stayed pretty flat, if not decreased a little\n",

            "[00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:26,400]  Okay. If you turn to slide four. And then in terms of the number of mobile number portability,\n",
            "[00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:34,400]  this is also showing the number has been going down as well. So ‚Äì and it has a little bit\n",
            "[00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:42,400]  less in the second quarter, 20. But then if you look at on the other ‚Äì the flip side\n",

            "[00:03:15,660 --> 00:03:23,880]  the lead. And then we are at a 708 for the post-paid. And then the blended is a 564.\n",
            "[00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:29,880]  And then in terms of our average customer satisfaction on the network quality, we are\n",

            "[00:03:53,810 --> 00:04:00,810]  Even given the pandemic impact, we are still seeing an encouraging growth.\n",
            "[00:04:00,810 --> 00:04:09,810]  So for the ‚Äì compared with the first half last year, our year-over-year growth is 26%.\n",
            "[00:04:09,810 --> 00:04:14,810]  And then if you look at some of the major categories like ICT, it accounts for more than\n",
            "[00:04:14,810 --> 00:04:23,810]  half of our new economy revenue. Our first half is ‚Äì has grown 53% year-over-year.\n",
            "[00:04:23,810 --> 00:04:29,810]  And then the second quarter alone, it's also a double-digit 17%, to be exact, growth\n",

            "[00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:39,840]  And then our IOT, you know, is almost 300% increase. And then also the cloud service\n",
            "[00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:45,840]  and then our mobile commerce, even though it's small, but then it's also showing\n",
            "[00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:48,840]  a double-digit growth as well.\n",
            "[00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:53,840]  And I have to say, these are reflecting the revenue we have realized in the first two\n",
            "[00:04:53,840 --> 00:05:00,840]  quarters. And then we do see some signs of us slowing down in some of the industry.\n",
            "[00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:08,840]  So we'll be very careful watching the pipeline in terms of the future impact that\n",
            "[00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:12,840]  may be reflected later, and not this year, but then not ‚Äì certainly not in the first\n",
            "[00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:17,840]  two quarters. But for what we have seen so far, it is still encouraging.\n",
            "[00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:25,000]  Okay. And then so in terms of our revenue, we are definitely impacted by COVID-19,\n",
            "[00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:30,000]  although compared with many other industries, we are still a lot better off.\n",
            "[00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:38,000]  But still with that, the first half revenue, we fell short by 6.5% of our board target.\n",
            "[00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:46,000]  However, we were able to manage our EPS and our EBITDA and our net income to exceed\n",
            "[00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:53,000]  our board target. So we are looking at, for the first half, the EPS is at 1.35,\n",
            "[00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:59,290]  and our guidance was 1.28. So that's about 106% of achievement.\n",

            "[00:07:12,570 --> 00:07:18,570]  Earning cash for Q2 is $15 billion. Total borrowing is $75 billion.\n",
            "[00:07:18,570 --> 00:07:21,570]  Net debt to EBITDA multiple is $2.09.\n",
            "[00:07:21,570 --> 00:07:25,570]  Free cash flow for the first half is $11 billion.\n",
            "[00:07:25,570 --> 00:07:28,570]  Cash cap for the first half is $2.5 billion.\n",
            "[00:07:28,570 --> 00:07:30,570]  That's all about the financials.\n",
            "[00:07:30,570 --> 00:07:34,570]  Let me turn the presentation to President Xu for the business update.\n",
            "[00:07:34,570 --> 00:07:36,570]  Okay, thank you, Sharon.\n",
            "[00:07:36,570 --> 00:07:41,570]  Okay, so some highlights for our second quarter this year.\n",
            "[00:07:41,570 --> 00:07:47,570]  First of all, we were pleased to have won Best CFR Award from Global News Monthly\n",
            "[00:07:47,570 --> 00:07:49,570]  for about four years in a row now.\n",
            "[00:07:49,570 --> 00:07:54,570]  Also, we were just recently granted Best Success Service in Taiwan\n",
            "[00:07:54,570 --> 00:07:57,570]  in the telecom category by Commercial Times.\n",
            "[00:07:57,570 --> 00:08:04,570]  This is nine years in a row and the only one that has been awarded this prize.\n",
            "[00:08:04,570 --> 00:08:11,880]  And then we have launched 5G service.\n",
            "[00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:18,880]  And then, as people know, all three, big three, have launched the service in early July.\n",
            "[00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:24,880]  And we also have launched our remote, or we call it telemedicine,\n",
            "[00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:30,880]  remote diagnosis in Taichung area.\n",
            "[00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:36,880]  And then this is really exciting and then this is really rewarding for us\n",
            "[00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:41,880]  because we look at this not just from a pure business or profitability perspective,\n",
            "[00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:47,880]  but this is really, we look at it as our best opportunity to return to the society.\n",
            "[00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:56,880]  So we are able to provide folks in the hard-to-reach area for the kind of medical care that they need\n",
            "[00:08:56,880 --> 00:09:01,880]  through our 5G technology and with the medical devices.\n",
            "[00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:11,880]  The results have been impressive and so we are in progress to expand to more areas in Taiwan.\n",
            "[00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:15,880]  And we also have to get some funding in this area.\n",
            "[00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:16,880]  Okay.\n",
            "[00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:24,880]  And then in terms of smart factory, we have kicked off our alliance with Microsoft\n",
            "[00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:26,880]  and also Delta Technologies.\n",
            "[00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:32,880]  And we are going to build the first, Taiwan's first 5G smart factory.\n",
            "[00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:33,880]  Okay.\n",
            "[00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:42,510]  And then we also announced our 5G services and pricing plans on July 3rd.\n",
            "[00:09:42,510 --> 00:09:45,510]  And then we showed a picture of the event that day.\n",
            "[00:09:45,510 --> 00:09:46,510]  It was quite an event.\n",
            "[00:09:46,510 --> 00:09:49,510]  It was a very interesting fun field.\n",
            "[00:09:49,510 --> 00:09:54,510]  And then also we have announced our detailed pricing plan,\n",
            "[00:09:54,510 --> 00:09:57,510]  which is kind of aligned with the other two.\n",
            "[00:09:57,510 --> 00:10:01,510]  But then I think we had a, we do have a little bit better offer\n",
            "[00:10:01,510 --> 00:10:04,510]  or at least more from the consumer's perspective.\n",
            "[00:10:04,510 --> 00:10:10,510]  So very soon after that our price was being followed by our peers.\n",
            "[00:10:10,510 --> 00:10:11,800]  Okay.\n",
            "[00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:16,800]  And in terms of the new 5G services that we have offered, that includes the VR\n",
            "[00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:23,800]  and through our Friday video department that we have expanded\n",
            "[00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:26,800]  and added another app for the Friday VR.\n",
            "[00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:32,800]  And then for the existing Friday video application,\n",
            "[00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:35,800]  we have introduced a multi-view feature.\n",
            "[00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:39,800]  And then we have also introduced content for that matter\n",
            "[00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:44,800]  and then the folks that have signed up for the service can already view it.\n",
            "[00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:49,800]  Some of them are so free for their, you know, just for them to get a feel for it.\n",
            "[00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:52,800]  And then we have high sound quality music.\n",
            "[00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:57,800]  And then we also have 4K video content.\n",
            "[00:10:57,800 --> 00:11:02,800]  And then, you know, even though there were only a few, or three to be exact,\n",
            "[00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:07,800]  handsets that were available in the month, early in the month,\n",
            "[00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:10,800]  but then some of them, not all of them, are, you know,\n",
            "[00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:16,800]  you actually could see the 4K video resolution on the phone with the 5G connectivity.\n",
            "[00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:20,800]  And then we are going to introduce cloud gaming in fourth quarter.\n",
            "[00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:23,020]  Okay.\n",
            "[00:11:23,020 --> 00:11:28,020]  And then also we are about to launch our VR family theater feature,\n",
            "[00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:30,020]  but then that's coming soon.\n",
            "[00:11:30,020 --> 00:11:32,250]  Okay.\n",
            "[00:11:32,250 --> 00:11:35,340]  To recap what we have done in the 5G area,\n",
            "[00:11:36,340 --> 00:11:40,340]  as folks know that we have got 80 megahertz\n",
            "[00:11:40,340 --> 00:11:46,340]  and then we also got the best location that we wanted for this 3.5G spectrum.\n",
            "[00:11:46,340 --> 00:11:53,340]  And then because we used the banjo that is offering the 4G, 5G dynamic spectrum sharing\n",
            "[00:11:53,340 --> 00:11:58,340]  and we believe we'll be able to optimize our network performance\n",
            "[00:11:58,340 --> 00:12:04,340]  and then really look at 4G and 5G together as a ubiquitous network\n",
            "[00:12:04,340 --> 00:12:07,340]  and to provide that end-to-end experience for our users.\n",
            "[00:12:07,340 --> 00:12:10,340]  So this is not the user from 4G to 5G.\n",
            "[00:12:10,340 --> 00:12:15,340]  This is really a user to have experience from 4G to 5G plus 4G.\n",
            "[00:12:15,340 --> 00:12:16,630]  Okay.\n",
            "[00:12:16,630 --> 00:12:19,630]  And we describe it as a two-layer cake.\n",
            "[00:12:19,630 --> 00:12:20,630]  Okay.\n",
            "[00:12:20,630 --> 00:12:22,630]  And then, of course, there's icing on the cake.\n",
            "[00:12:22,630 --> 00:12:27,630]  That's all these extra or additional 5G services that we provided.\n",
            "[00:12:27,630 --> 00:12:33,630]  And then for the coverage, for the network coverage, we are building as we speak\n",
            "[00:12:33,630 --> 00:12:39,630]  and then we are looking at the first priority are on the six metropolitan areas\n",
            "[00:12:39,630 --> 00:12:45,630]  and, of course, like in order to support a telemedicine initiative in Taitung.\n",
            "[00:12:45,630 --> 00:12:51,630]  So even though that county isn't as much populated as the northern area,\n",
            "[00:12:51,630 --> 00:12:57,630]  but we still have our presence of the 5G stations for that matter to support this telemedicine.\n",
            "[00:12:57,630 --> 00:13:01,050]  And then we will reach more than 50 percent.\n",
            "[00:13:01,050 --> 00:13:05,050]  It's actually 55 percent nationwide, the population coverage.\n",
            "[00:13:05,050 --> 00:13:12,050]  And then for Taipei City and by the end of the year, it will be 80 percent population covered.\n",
            "[00:13:12,050 --> 00:13:17,050]  And then in the new Taipei City area, it will be about 78 percent.\n",
            "[00:13:17,050 --> 00:13:22,050]  But then if you take the average for the whole nation, that's about 55 by the end of the year.\n",
            "[00:13:22,050 --> 00:13:28,050]  And that will be looking at about up to 4,000 stations that we will be deploying.\n",
            "[00:13:28,050 --> 00:13:30,050]  And right now we are about half of it.\n",
            "[00:13:30,050 --> 00:13:31,050]  That's where we are.\n",
            "[00:13:31,050 --> 00:13:35,050]  And then, like I said, since early May we started deploying,\n",
            "[00:13:35,050 --> 00:13:41,050]  but we have been on schedule and at the same pace throughout the few months.\n",
            "[00:13:41,050 --> 00:13:45,050]  And this will continue until the end of the year.\n",
            "[00:13:45,050 --> 00:13:48,460]  And also I touched on the pricing.\n",
            "[00:13:48,460 --> 00:13:50,460]  I believe our pricing is very rational.\n",
            "[00:13:50,460 --> 00:13:55,460]  And then we also really look at it from the consumer's perspective.\n",
            "[00:13:55,460 --> 00:14:04,460]  So that's why when we offer 999 and 1199, in the case there, it's not a limited data plan for 5G.\n",
            "[00:14:04,460 --> 00:14:11,460]  And then instead it's a 60G per month or 100G per month.\n",
            "[00:14:11,460 --> 00:14:18,460]  Once it's used up, then the users will fall back to the 4G plan, which is already unlimited.\n",
            "[00:14:18,460 --> 00:14:28,460]  And then we will still guarantee their average up to 50 megahertz per second kind of speed.\n",
            "[00:14:28,460 --> 00:14:31,460]  So it gives them a very good 4G speed.\n",
            "[00:14:31,460 --> 00:14:32,620]  Okay.\n",
            "[00:14:32,620 --> 00:14:42,620]  And then for those 5G child subscriptions, so we actually, for this month since we launched on the 3rd,\n",
            "[00:14:42,620 --> 00:14:47,620]  what we see on a daily basis has been very impressive and very encouraging.\n",
            "[00:14:47,620 --> 00:14:49,620]  And we like what we see.\n",
            "[00:14:49,620 --> 00:14:53,620]  And I think it's even better than we expected.\n",
            "[00:14:53,620 --> 00:15:02,620]  So almost 80% of those that signed up for the 5G plans are our renewal customers.\n",
            "[00:15:02,620 --> 00:15:04,620]  So that's the existing customers upgrade.\n",
            "[00:15:04,620 --> 00:15:15,620]  And then also 99% of those that signed up for 5G, they signed up for the plan that is at least 999 and then above.\n",
            "[00:15:15,620 --> 00:15:16,620]  Okay.\n",
            "[00:15:16,620 --> 00:15:23,620]  And then so just for this month, we already see the average monthly bill on the same customer base.\n",
            "[00:15:23,620 --> 00:15:27,620]  We already see the uplift by 12%.\n",
            "[00:15:27,620 --> 00:15:30,620]  So we are encouraged by what we see.\n",
            "[00:15:30,620 --> 00:15:38,620]  And even though this is a slow month, so if you look at the total sales-wise, it's about flat from June.\n",
            "[00:15:38,620 --> 00:15:45,620]  And then so we are hoping as we are getting more devices available in August, then this should improve.\n",
            "[00:15:45,620 --> 00:15:51,620]  And then when the iPhone becomes available in late September or early October-ish,\n",
            "[00:15:51,620 --> 00:15:56,230]  and then that is when we should see the peak.\n",
            "[00:15:56,230 --> 00:15:57,230]  Okay.\n",
            "[00:15:57,230 --> 00:16:07,230]  And then in terms of our 2020 second half priorities, we will continue and accelerate our 5G RAN rollout.\n",
            "[00:16:07,230 --> 00:16:15,230]  And then for our consumer business, as I mentioned earlier, we are going to launch the cloud gaming services.\n",
            "[00:16:15,230 --> 00:16:18,230]  So that is something we are working on.\n",
            "[00:16:18,230 --> 00:16:24,230]  And then, of course, we will work really hard to convert more existing subscribers to 5G plans.\n",
            "[00:16:24,230 --> 00:16:29,230]  And if we will get some new ones from our peers, we'll be happy to take them too.\n",
            "[00:16:29,230 --> 00:16:36,230]  And then on the enterprise side, we will create and deliver private network solutions from the previous POCs.\n",
            "[00:16:36,230 --> 00:16:42,230]  We have quite a few engagements and then quite a few needs in our pipeline.\n",
            "[00:16:42,230 --> 00:16:44,230]  We just need to close the deal.\n",
            "[00:16:44,230 --> 00:16:50,230]  And then we would like to, of course, increase our market share and presence in smart city,\n",
            "[00:16:50,230 --> 00:16:58,970]  smart manufacturing, and smart telemedicine, which we see a lot of growth opportunities or growth potentials.\n",
            "[00:16:58,970 --> 00:16:59,970]  Okay.\n",
            "[00:16:59,970 --> 00:17:02,970]  With that, I think that concludes our presentation for you.\n",
            "[00:17:02,970 --> 00:17:04,970]  And we will welcome questions.\n",
            "[00:17:04,970 --> 00:17:06,510]  Yes.\n",
            "[00:17:06,510 --> 00:17:07,510]  Thank you, President Xi.\n",
            "[00:17:07,510 --> 00:17:11,510]  Ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin our question and answer session.\n",
            "[00:17:11,510 --> 00:17:18,510]  If you have a question for any of today's speakers, please press 01 on your telephone keypad and you will enter the queue.\n",
            "[00:17:18,510 --> 00:17:21,510]  After you are announced, please ask your question.\n",
            "[00:17:21,510 --> 00:17:28,510]  If you find that your question has been answered before it is your turn to speak, please press 02 to cancel the question.\n",
            "[00:17:28,510 --> 00:17:29,510]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:17:29,510 --> 00:17:39,820]  The first question is coming from Neil Anderson of HSBC.\n",
            "[00:17:39,820 --> 00:17:41,820]  Go ahead, please.\n",
            "[00:17:41,820 --> 00:17:42,820]  Hi there.\n",
            "[00:17:42,820 --> 00:17:46,820]  Good afternoon, and congratulations on taking up the CFO role.\n",
            "[00:17:46,820 --> 00:17:52,820]  I really just have one question, and it's about the second half as it relates to guidance.\n",
            "[00:17:52,820 --> 00:18:01,820]  So I think in the first half, correct me if I'm wrong, but your equipment sales were probably lower than you expected because of COVID.\n",
            "[00:18:01,820 --> 00:18:02,820]  Correct.\n",
            "[00:18:03,820 --> 00:18:06,820]  Yeah, so that should pick up in the second half.\n",
            "[00:18:06,820 --> 00:18:12,820]  I mean, you're slightly ahead on profit, but presumably the marketing expense is going to accelerate as well.\n",
            "[00:18:12,820 --> 00:18:18,550]  So is that the main change you expect in the second half?\n",
            "[00:18:18,550 --> 00:18:20,550]  Is that the main sort of cost driver?\n",
            "[00:18:20,550 --> 00:18:23,550]  Are there other levers there?\n",
            "[00:18:23,550 --> 00:18:24,550]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:18:24,550 --> 00:18:26,350]  Okay.\n",
            "[00:18:26,350 --> 00:18:28,350]  So first of all, yes, you're right.\n",
            "[00:18:28,350 --> 00:18:34,350]  Our merchandise sales was impacted by COVID-19, and we do expect some rebound.\n",
            "[00:18:34,350 --> 00:18:40,350]  Now, would it totally recover what, you know, we have not gained in the first half?\n",
            "[00:18:40,350 --> 00:18:49,350]  I think that would be a question, and we believe it will rebound, but if it's 100% recovery, I wouldn't think so.\n",
            "[00:18:49,350 --> 00:18:57,350]  But then on the other hand, in terms of the op-ex reduction that we have seen in the first half, and you're right,\n",
            "[00:18:57,350 --> 00:19:01,350]  some of that is a variable cost associated with the sales and all that.\n",
            "[00:19:01,350 --> 00:19:03,350]  So they were reduced when the sales was lower.\n",
            "[00:19:03,350 --> 00:19:11,350]  And then as we expect more sales and more merchandise and subsidies, so that will go up.\n",
            "[00:19:11,350 --> 00:19:20,350]  But then overall, we have done cost control more than just a variable cost, so in our facility, our utility, across the board.\n",
            "[00:19:20,350 --> 00:19:26,350]  So we will still continue to do that, so the cost control is still high on our priority.\n",
            "[00:19:27,350 --> 00:19:31,350]  I don't know if that answers your question, but if not, let me know.\n",
            "[00:19:31,350 --> 00:19:33,090]  Okay.\n",
            "[00:19:33,090 --> 00:19:34,090]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:19:34,090 --> 00:19:35,090]  That's helpful.\n",
            "[00:19:35,090 --> 00:19:38,090]  If I could just follow up on the 5G cost side.\n",
            "[00:19:38,090 --> 00:19:46,820]  So it looks from the way you discussed the tariffs that the high levels of data usage in Taiwan are going to continue.\n",
            "[00:19:46,820 --> 00:19:50,820]  You've got very large capacity 5G plans, unlimited on 4G.\n",
            "[00:19:51,820 --> 00:19:59,110]  So do you expect the costs related to that, the operating costs, to continue to increase?\n",
            "[00:19:59,110 --> 00:20:09,110]  Is that going to be a drag on your profitability as you're supporting much higher levels of data usage than operators in other markets?\n",
            "[00:20:09,110 --> 00:20:22,640]  If you're talking ‚Äì well, so first of all, even without 5G, right, our network ‚Äì work on network is never stopped.\n",
            "[00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:26,640]  So there is definitely a shift kind of effect, right?\n",
            "[00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:34,640]  So we are shifting some of our investment and our related costs, you know, from 4G to 5G.\n",
            "[00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:40,640]  This is kind of a technology evolution, right?\n",
            "[00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:45,640]  And then so associated operating costs, there will be some shifting as well.\n",
            "[00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:55,640]  And also, as this is an NSA architecture, so when we build or we deploy these 5G stations, in many cases,\n",
            "[00:20:55,640 --> 00:21:01,640]  they are deployed at the same stations and location on top of what we already have there.\n",
            "[00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:05,640]  So these are not, you know, like something we start from scratch.\n",
            "[00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:12,640]  So that itself, there's already a synergy by reusing what we already have deployed previously.\n",
            "[00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:20,640]  And in some cases, like we have in some stations where we hide some of the 3G equipment,\n",
            "[00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:22,640]  and then there's also that synergy.\n",
            "[00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:28,640]  We can just reuse those space, and then in terms of the utility consumption and all that.\n",
            "[00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:32,640]  So ‚Äì but then this is a new technology we are deploying.\n",
            "[00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:36,640]  So yes, there will be more expense incurred.\n",
            "[00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:37,640]  That is just natural.\n",
            "[00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:41,640]  But then that's also something we have taken into account in our forecast.\n",
            "[00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:44,780]  That's great. Thank you.\n",
            "[00:21:44,780 --> 00:21:46,650]  Okay.\n",
            "[00:21:46,650 --> 00:21:54,200]  And next we'll have Billy Lee of Credit Suisse to ask questions.\n",
            "[00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:55,200]  Go ahead, please.\n",
            "[00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:59,090]  Thank you, Man. Good afternoon.\n",
            "[00:21:59,090 --> 00:22:01,090]  I've got two questions.\n",
            "[00:22:01,090 --> 00:22:06,090]  The first question is a 5G subscriber.\n",
            "[00:22:06,090 --> 00:22:14,090]  I see on the slide at the end, you talk about there's an encouraging trend of existing customer-operated 5G plans.\n",
            "[00:22:14,090 --> 00:22:16,090]  So that's pretty encouraging.\n",
            "[00:22:17,090 --> 00:22:24,090]  Can you talk about the number of 5G trial subscribers that you have for that chart right now?\n",
            "[00:22:24,090 --> 00:22:28,090]  I just want to know, like, what's the current number of 5G subscribers?\n",
            "[00:22:28,090 --> 00:22:30,090]  That's the first question.\n",
            "[00:22:30,090 --> 00:22:38,090]  And the second question is, what's your target number of 5G subscribers by the end of the year and by 2021?\n",
            "[00:22:38,090 --> 00:22:40,090]  So that's my two questions. Thank you.\n",
            "[00:22:40,090 --> 00:22:42,210]  Okay.\n",
            "[00:22:42,210 --> 00:22:43,210]  All right.\n",
            "[00:22:43,210 --> 00:22:44,210]  We knew this would come up.\n",
            "[00:22:45,210 --> 00:22:51,210]  And we also know my peer who had our call yesterday didn't give the right number.\n",
            "[00:22:51,210 --> 00:22:54,210]  But at least I'll give you some clues.\n",
            "[00:22:54,210 --> 00:23:03,210]  So for the first month, or it's not really a full month, from the third, right, from the third day when we launched the service,\n",
            "[00:23:03,210 --> 00:23:09,210]  we are seeing a few tens of thousands of subscribers already in this month so far.\n",
            "[00:23:09,210 --> 00:23:11,210]  So it's like 28 days or so.\n",
            "[00:23:11,210 --> 00:23:13,210]  Yeah.\n",
            "[00:23:13,210 --> 00:23:23,300]  And then we were expecting or we were hoping that first year, that this was before pandemic, of course.\n",
            "[00:23:23,300 --> 00:23:33,300]  Our original forecast was, you know, and our goal was to convert 20% of our 4G subscribers to 5G plans.\n",
            "[00:23:33,300 --> 00:23:42,300]  But then if I just take a sample for what I see in the past month, you know, out of the total renews in GAs that we get,\n",
            "[00:23:42,300 --> 00:23:46,300]  it's about 20% that we actually got them to sign up for 5G.\n",
            "[00:23:46,300 --> 00:23:51,300]  So just for a small sample like that, this is what I was hoping.\n",
            "[00:23:51,300 --> 00:23:54,300]  And this was even before the pandemic.\n",
            "[00:23:54,300 --> 00:24:02,300]  But then I think the big question is really as we all are, you know, not able to predict, you know, what the situation will be.\n",
            "[00:24:02,300 --> 00:24:03,300]  Would it get worse?\n",
            "[00:24:03,300 --> 00:24:05,300]  Would it get better global-wise?\n",
            "[00:24:05,300 --> 00:24:08,300]  And then Taiwan cannot be isolated from the rest of the world.\n",
            "[00:24:09,300 --> 00:24:16,300]  So if the whole consumer market is going to be impacted, that will be something really beyond what we can predict.\n",
            "[00:24:16,300 --> 00:24:25,300]  But if this is under normal time and then this first month, while we didn't have many and we only have three handset devices,\n",
            "[00:24:25,300 --> 00:24:31,300]  very limited supply, and then I'm seeing 20% of a conversion, you know,\n",
            "[00:24:31,300 --> 00:24:37,300]  even though the sales is relatively smaller or lower than our good month.\n",
            "[00:24:37,300 --> 00:24:43,300]  But then if this can, you know, can serve as a reference, I think we are seeing 20%.\n",
            "[00:24:43,300 --> 00:24:50,300]  The question is how long this will last and then how the total overall consumer market will be.\n",
            "[00:24:50,300 --> 00:24:58,770]  I hope I answered your question a little bit better than the other.\n",
            "[00:24:58,770 --> 00:24:59,770]  Yeah, yeah.\n",
            "[00:24:59,770 --> 00:25:00,770]  Very helpful.\n",
            "[00:25:00,770 --> 00:25:10,770]  But I just want to clarify for 20%, so far up to this point of the month today, what 20% means?\n",
            "[00:25:10,770 --> 00:25:12,770]  Like can you clarify a little bit?\n",
            "[00:25:12,770 --> 00:25:14,770]  Or is it 20% of the total?\n",
            "[00:25:14,770 --> 00:25:18,770]  So like I'm looking at my daily sales, right, the daily transactions.\n",
            "[00:25:18,770 --> 00:25:22,770]  That includes the new app and then that includes the renewed.\n",
            "[00:25:22,770 --> 00:25:28,770]  So if I look at just the daily transactions, I'm looking at about 20% of them will sign up for 5G.\n",
            "[00:25:28,770 --> 00:25:30,770]  That's the 20% I'm looking at.\n",
            "[00:25:30,770 --> 00:25:37,770]  So it's a small sample and then, you know, statistically it may not be all, you know,\n",
            "[00:25:37,770 --> 00:25:40,770]  100% correlated with the eventual number we are looking at.\n",
            "[00:25:40,770 --> 00:25:46,770]  Also another point of a clarification, when we talk about 20% of our subscribers\n",
            "[00:25:46,770 --> 00:25:52,770]  and then, you know, we are really talking about post-pays because those that are involved with contracts,\n",
            "[00:25:52,770 --> 00:25:55,770]  they come to the stores for renew or whatever.\n",
            "[00:25:55,770 --> 00:26:01,770]  This is different than pre-pay in which the service we offer right now are to post-pays first anyway.\n",
            "[00:26:01,770 --> 00:26:09,770]  So I think there is a confusion at some point because our overall number is like a 7 million,\n",
            "[00:26:09,770 --> 00:26:18,120]  but then our post-pay is about 537, 5.37 million, right?\n",
            "[00:26:18,120 --> 00:26:23,120]  So there is a difference in the denominator or in the base that you would use.\n",
            "[00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:25,120]  But then we are talking about post-pays.\n",
            "[00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:29,930]  I see, I see.\n",
            "[00:26:29,930 --> 00:26:30,930]  That's very clear.\n",
            "[00:26:30,930 --> 00:26:31,930]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:26:31,930 --> 00:26:33,930]  Can I just ask one more question?\n",
            "[00:26:33,930 --> 00:26:34,930]  Sure.\n",
            "[00:26:34,930 --> 00:26:42,930]  On the coverage, the base station coverage, you talk about 4,000 is the target by the end of the year.\n",
            "[00:26:42,930 --> 00:26:45,930]  And do you have a figure for next year?\n",
            "[00:26:45,930 --> 00:26:47,930]  Because Tsinghua obviously has a target.\n",
            "[00:26:47,930 --> 00:26:49,930]  And I just want other ones to be‚Ä¶\n",
            "[00:26:49,930 --> 00:26:56,930]  I'm also interested to know about the cap-tech trend in next year and beyond if possible.\n",
            "[00:26:56,930 --> 00:26:58,920]  Okay.\n",
            "[00:26:58,920 --> 00:27:09,140]  Yeah, so for this year, we are talking about 4,000 or up to 4,000.\n",
            "[00:27:09,140 --> 00:27:14,140]  Those are the ones that we will deploy at the 3.5 spectrum.\n",
            "[00:27:14,140 --> 00:27:22,140]  Actually, there will be at least a few hundred more that we will deploy at the lower band as well.\n",
            "[00:27:22,140 --> 00:27:30,140]  So if you look at the total number of stations that we will deploy for 5G and not restricted to just 3.5G,\n",
            "[00:27:30,140 --> 00:27:33,140]  we'll be more than 4,000, right, for this year.\n",
            "[00:27:33,140 --> 00:27:38,140]  And then because that's our optimized spectrum planning here.\n",
            "[00:27:38,140 --> 00:27:42,140]  And then for 2021, I think it would only make sense.\n",
            "[00:27:42,140 --> 00:27:49,140]  Well, first of all, there are a couple of factors I always say that will affect how much we will want to invest.\n",
            "[00:27:49,140 --> 00:27:56,140]  First, that is how the market, how the consumers react to what we offer, right?\n",
            "[00:27:56,140 --> 00:28:03,140]  So for the next few months, I think, as we already planned, you know, to deploy 2,000 more at least.\n",
            "[00:28:03,140 --> 00:28:07,140]  So as we are deploying, we will see how the market responds.\n",
            "[00:28:07,140 --> 00:28:15,140]  And then we can decide in 2021 how many more we would like to deploy and also where\n",
            "[00:28:15,140 --> 00:28:21,140]  because we continue to do some big data analytics and to see where the demand is\n",
            "[00:28:21,140 --> 00:28:24,140]  and where we need to, you know, put more resources.\n",
            "[00:28:24,140 --> 00:28:31,140]  So it will not just buy a numbers game, but it really needs to do some thorough analysis\n",
            "[00:28:31,140 --> 00:28:34,140]  to decide how many we need and where.\n",
            "[00:28:34,140 --> 00:28:40,140]  So I wouldn't give a number, but then if the market responds really well, it wouldn't make sense.\n",
            "[00:28:40,140 --> 00:28:44,140]  I don't respond or I don't react to it and then wait a couple years later.\n",
            "[00:28:44,140 --> 00:28:49,140]  So if the market responds well, I think we would just continue the same kind of pace.\n",
            "[00:28:49,140 --> 00:28:53,220]  Okay. Thank you.\n",
            "[00:28:53,220 --> 00:29:02,930]  As a reminder, please press 01 on your keypad if you would like to ask a question.\n",
            "[00:29:02,930 --> 00:29:03,930]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:29:03,930 --> 00:29:09,240]  And the next question is coming from Sarah Wong of Morgan Stanley.\n",
            "[00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:10,240]  Go ahead, please.\n",
            "[00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:13,320]  Thank you, Madeline.\n",
            "[00:29:13,320 --> 00:29:16,320]  I have three questions.\n",
            "[00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:21,320]  First one is that congratulations again on the 5G adoption.\n",
            "[00:29:21,320 --> 00:29:30,320]  I think the initial R2 lead is toward the high end, especially compared with peers over, for example, in Asia.\n",
            "[00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:38,320]  So may I ask what's the key pattern or what's the reason we are seeing that customers are upgrading to 5G?\n",
            "[00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:45,320]  So, for example, in other markets, some countries offer higher data allowance in 5G\n",
            "[00:29:45,320 --> 00:29:50,320]  or some countries have many new 5G models.\n",
            "[00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:56,320]  So what do we see in Taiwan market to incentivize people upgrading to 5G?\n",
            "[00:29:56,320 --> 00:30:01,420]  And then second question is the new economy business.\n",
            "[00:30:01,420 --> 00:30:08,420]  May I ask how much percentage of total revenue is it for now?\n",
            "[00:30:08,420 --> 00:30:21,420]  And then going to second half, are we seeing a decline or delay of especially like enterprise ICT projects amid COVID-19 or macro uncertainties?\n",
            "[00:30:21,420 --> 00:30:25,420]  And the third question is that on dividends.\n",
            "[00:30:25,420 --> 00:30:35,450]  So it seems like based on our guidance, if you want to keep flat dividend, the payout ratio as percentage net profit will be really high.\n",
            "[00:30:35,450 --> 00:30:40,450]  So at this point of time, do we have any comments?\n",
            "[00:30:40,450 --> 00:30:41,450]  Luke?\n",
            "[00:30:41,450 --> 00:30:43,250]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:30:43,250 --> 00:30:44,250]  Okay.\n",
            "[00:30:44,250 --> 00:30:47,250]  I'll answer your question in a reverse order.\n",
            "[00:30:47,250 --> 00:30:55,250]  So first on the dividend, I think it's really too early and then we are not at a liberty to comment on that.\n",
            "[00:30:55,250 --> 00:31:02,250]  And your second question regarding the new economy, for the second half, you know, for the first half,\n",
            "[00:31:02,250 --> 00:31:07,250]  what we are looking at is already 15.3% of our total revenue.\n",
            "[00:31:07,250 --> 00:31:10,250]  And I think it exceeds our target.\n",
            "[00:31:10,250 --> 00:31:12,250]  Our target was like 14%.\n",
            "[00:31:12,250 --> 00:31:16,250]  So it is 15.3%.\n",
            "[00:31:16,250 --> 00:31:17,250]  Okay.\n",
            "[00:31:17,250 --> 00:31:23,250]  And your first question about why I think, you know, our consumers are converting,\n",
            "[00:31:24,250 --> 00:31:33,250]  I have to say because I think Taiwan is the second cheapest, you know, 4G rate plan worldwide, right?\n",
            "[00:31:33,250 --> 00:31:36,250]  And then I believe our consumers do know that.\n",
            "[00:31:36,250 --> 00:31:41,250]  They do know that they got a really, really good deal, right, on 4G.\n",
            "[00:31:41,250 --> 00:31:50,250]  And even with our 5G plan, when they compare, okay, 499 versus 1399, my answer was always you are comparing oranges and apples, right?\n",
            "[00:31:50,250 --> 00:31:52,250]  So 499 is like a spin along.\n",
            "[00:31:52,250 --> 00:32:01,250]  In 1399, you get, you know, the new phone and it was a good size of subsidy and you get a much better phone\n",
            "[00:32:01,250 --> 00:32:06,250]  and you get to, you know, get on 5G when the 5G is available.\n",
            "[00:32:06,250 --> 00:32:12,250]  So you get better service and you, on top of it, that's the icing on the cake, you also get new services, right,\n",
            "[00:32:12,250 --> 00:32:15,250]  and you get new features that associate with 5G.\n",
            "[00:32:15,250 --> 00:32:17,250]  And I also like to use analogy.\n",
            "[00:32:17,250 --> 00:32:21,250]  People are saying 1399 is too expensive.\n",
            "[00:32:21,250 --> 00:32:26,250]  I ask them, you have a cup of coffee from one of the convenience stores for $45 a day.\n",
            "[00:32:26,250 --> 00:32:34,250]  If I ask you, you know, I give you $45 a day, do you want coffee or you want a whole day unlimited data invoice\n",
            "[00:32:34,250 --> 00:32:39,250]  and then you're able to make calls, do things with your phone, what would you choose?\n",
            "[00:32:40,280 --> 00:32:48,280]  Or if I pay you $45 for your whole day, you know, unlimited data access and whatever you can do with your phone,\n",
            "[00:32:48,280 --> 00:32:50,280]  would you sell it to me?\n",
            "[00:32:50,280 --> 00:32:52,280]  And I don't think anyone would do that, right?\n",
            "[00:32:52,280 --> 00:32:59,280]  So $45 a day is certainly a very, very good deal and then nobody can deny that.\n",
            "[00:32:59,280 --> 00:33:07,280]  And I do believe, you know, Taiwan's consumers are really smart and they know they are getting a too good deal with 4G\n",
            "[00:33:07,280 --> 00:33:14,280]  and then our 5G offering, given the cost that the telcos have put down, it is more than reasonable.\n",
            "[00:33:14,280 --> 00:33:17,380]  And then I think they see that.\n",
            "[00:33:17,380 --> 00:33:19,540]  And more of them will see that.\n",
            "[00:33:19,540 --> 00:33:21,540]  I'm confident in that.\n",
            "[00:33:21,540 --> 00:33:27,160]  Okay, I hope that answers your question.\n",
            "[00:33:27,160 --> 00:33:28,160]  Yeah, thank you.\n",
            "[00:33:28,160 --> 00:33:34,160]  Just maybe a quick follow-up on, for example, the 5G plan.\n",
            "[00:33:34,160 --> 00:33:40,160]  Definitely customers will have a much better experience, for example, from the 3099 services.\n",
            "[00:33:40,160 --> 00:33:48,160]  But in terms of marginal cost, seeing 5G would involve more, for example, operating costs,\n",
            "[00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:51,160]  especially sales marketing or handset subsidies.\n",
            "[00:33:51,160 --> 00:33:59,160]  So what's our strategy on, for example, sales marketing budget going forward for 5G?\n",
            "[00:33:59,160 --> 00:34:07,160]  Are we looking for something like 5G standalone, for example, for a single customer,\n",
            "[00:34:07,160 --> 00:34:12,160]  that EBITDA margin should remain flat versus our current level?\n",
            "[00:34:12,160 --> 00:34:20,160]  Or how do we look at the, for example, incremental 5G subscribers EBITDA margin?\n",
            "[00:34:20,160 --> 00:34:29,240]  Okay, so, well, first of all, we are, well, the resources are always limited.\n",
            "[00:34:29,240 --> 00:34:32,240]  And then 5G is definitely our priority.\n",
            "[00:34:32,240 --> 00:34:39,240]  So in terms of how we would allocate our money for the subsidy or whatever marketing,\n",
            "[00:34:39,240 --> 00:34:47,240]  you know, acquisition cost or funding that we have for 4G versus 5G, and I think the choice will be clear.\n",
            "[00:34:47,240 --> 00:34:54,240]  So, again, this is like a reallocation instead of like on top of, you know,\n",
            "[00:34:54,240 --> 00:34:58,240]  what we have used to offer for 4G and we add more for 5G.\n",
            "[00:34:58,240 --> 00:35:04,240]  So the net-net should be about the same and maybe just, you know, a tidbit more.\n",
            "[00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:06,240]  But then it wouldn't be a lot more.\n",
            "[00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:17,580]  And then because there's a reshuffling of the funding that we do for marketing or for the subsidy.\n",
            "[00:35:17,580 --> 00:35:18,580]  Got it.\n",
            "[00:35:18,580 --> 00:35:19,800]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:23,840]  Sure.\n",
            "[00:35:23,840 --> 00:35:25,840]  We're now in question and answer session.\n",
            "[00:35:25,840 --> 00:35:29,840]  If you would like to ask a question, please press 01 on your telephone keypad.\n",
            "[00:35:29,840 --> 00:35:30,840]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:35:30,840 --> 00:35:42,360]  And the next to ask questions are from Danny Chu, Bank of America.\n",
            "[00:35:42,360 --> 00:35:45,160]  Go ahead, please.\n",
            "[00:35:45,160 --> 00:35:47,160]  Thank you for the presentation.\n",
            "[00:35:47,160 --> 00:35:52,160]  I just have two questions related to the new services that we just launched.\n",
            "[00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:58,160]  First question is on the 5G telehealth service that Firestone launched.\n",
            "[00:35:58,160 --> 00:36:01,160]  May I ask what is the business model?\n",
            "[00:36:01,160 --> 00:36:04,160]  Like, I mean, how do you charge the customer?\n",
            "[00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:11,160]  Is it on a so-called clinic visit or how the service is being charged?\n",
            "[00:36:11,160 --> 00:36:13,160]  That's the first question.\n",
            "[00:36:13,160 --> 00:36:20,160]  Second question is also about the cooperation with Delta Electronics on the 5G smart factory.\n",
            "[00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:27,160]  We just collect like an upfront payment from Delta Electronics or we,\n",
            "[00:36:27,160 --> 00:36:30,160]  similar to a normal monthly subscription model,\n",
            "[00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:34,160]  we are getting a monthly subscription fee from Delta Electronics\n",
            "[00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:40,160]  or it is just entirely based on the volume of data usage.\n",
            "[00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:41,160]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:36:41,160 --> 00:36:43,340]  Okay.\n",
            "[00:36:43,340 --> 00:36:46,340]  I'll answer your first question on telemedicine.\n",
            "[00:36:46,340 --> 00:36:53,340]  So this is, we will have two parts, right?\n",
            "[00:36:53,340 --> 00:36:57,340]  So one is the installation, the setup of the network.\n",
            "[00:36:58,340 --> 00:37:01,340]  So there is that solutioning aspect of it.\n",
            "[00:37:01,340 --> 00:37:11,340]  And then also for the, then there will be the ongoing subscription, the usage, right?\n",
            "[00:37:11,340 --> 00:37:16,340]  And then so there will be a recurring monthly fee kind of arrangement.\n",
            "[00:37:16,340 --> 00:37:23,340]  And then this will be charged to, in this case, like we were working with the city, right,\n",
            "[00:37:23,340 --> 00:37:26,340]  or the county.\n",
            "[00:37:26,340 --> 00:37:34,340]  And then there is also some funding that comes from the health and the welfare department.\n",
            "[00:37:34,340 --> 00:37:43,340]  So this first project that we did with Taitung is kind of like it's a pioneer.\n",
            "[00:37:43,340 --> 00:37:50,340]  And then so while we are doing this, and I know our government is welcoming this kind of,\n",
            "[00:37:51,340 --> 00:37:55,340]  they think this is very creative because in the past people think, okay,\n",
            "[00:37:55,340 --> 00:38:02,340]  if there is not enough medical resources for those far and away kind of areas,\n",
            "[00:38:02,340 --> 00:38:04,340]  then you just build hospitals.\n",
            "[00:38:04,340 --> 00:38:08,340]  But the problem is there is no doctor that will go to those areas.\n",
            "[00:38:08,340 --> 00:38:14,340]  So you get empty hospitals with all the hardware but no software, no experts, right?\n",
            "[00:38:14,340 --> 00:38:20,340]  And then so this using the telemedicine, we are using the network, our network,\n",
            "[00:38:20,340 --> 00:38:26,340]  to replace, you know, the actual roads that people otherwise will need to travel,\n",
            "[00:38:26,340 --> 00:38:29,380]  either it's the patient or the doctors.\n",
            "[00:38:29,380 --> 00:38:32,380]  So they look at this model as very effective.\n",
            "[00:38:32,380 --> 00:38:38,380]  And then so we have got a lot of interest and encouragement from the government to do more.\n",
            "[00:38:38,380 --> 00:38:43,380]  And then so exact business model, I can't say I already have a charging, you know,\n",
            "[00:38:43,380 --> 00:38:45,380]  a bill set up for this.\n",
            "[00:38:45,380 --> 00:38:49,380]  But then at the beginning, you know, there is a project funding\n",
            "[00:38:49,380 --> 00:38:52,380]  that is funded by the government.\n",
            "[00:38:52,380 --> 00:38:58,380]  So as for the ongoing, you know, once it's going to be per hospital\n",
            "[00:38:58,380 --> 00:39:01,380]  because there will be public hospitals, there will be private hospitals,\n",
            "[00:39:01,380 --> 00:39:04,380]  that should be a different kind of model.\n",
            "[00:39:04,380 --> 00:39:08,380]  But then at the beginning, all these that we have done,\n",
            "[00:39:08,380 --> 00:39:11,380]  they all got some kind of government funding as well.\n",
            "[00:39:11,380 --> 00:39:13,380]  So that definitely helped.\n",
            "[00:39:13,380 --> 00:39:14,380]  Okay?\n",
            "[00:39:14,380 --> 00:39:21,600]  And then for the second one, the MOU we have signed with Delta and Microsoft\n",
            "[00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:26,600]  is really an indication that we are, you know, solutioning together\n",
            "[00:39:26,600 --> 00:39:32,600]  because this is combining the communication technology that we are good at, right?\n",
            "[00:39:32,600 --> 00:39:33,600]  We are best at.\n",
            "[00:39:33,600 --> 00:39:35,600]  Plus the IT, right?\n",
            "[00:39:35,600 --> 00:39:37,600]  The information technology.\n",
            "[00:39:37,600 --> 00:39:41,600]  That includes the infrastructure, that includes the applications,\n",
            "[00:39:41,600 --> 00:39:44,600]  and that includes the cloud, you know, layer.\n",
            "[00:39:44,600 --> 00:39:48,600]  And so this is where Microsoft and the Far Eastern,\n",
            "[00:39:48,600 --> 00:39:51,600]  we both have an important role to play.\n",
            "[00:39:51,600 --> 00:39:55,600]  And then, of course, on top of it, it is the operations technology.\n",
            "[00:39:55,600 --> 00:39:58,600]  That's where Delta comes with, right?\n",
            "[00:39:58,600 --> 00:40:02,600]  So this is a total solution that we are integrating it together.\n",
            "[00:40:02,600 --> 00:40:06,600]  And then the idea is once we have this set up, you know,\n",
            "[00:40:06,600 --> 00:40:10,600]  similar or maybe smaller scale of solution or similar solution\n",
            "[00:40:10,600 --> 00:40:14,600]  can be repeated or replicated for other, you know,\n",
            "[00:40:14,600 --> 00:40:17,600]  vertical companies where they need factories.\n",
            "[00:40:17,600 --> 00:40:23,600]  So the total solution, if we now ‚Äì so it's not how much I charge Delta\n",
            "[00:40:23,600 --> 00:40:25,600]  or Delta charge me.\n",
            "[00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:28,600]  In this, we are partners building the solution together.\n",
            "[00:40:28,600 --> 00:40:33,600]  That can be replicated for different vertical, you know, factories\n",
            "[00:40:33,600 --> 00:40:37,600]  and then that are interested in it becoming a small factory.\n",
            "[00:40:37,600 --> 00:40:46,600]  Especially a lot of our Taiwanese investors or corporations,\n",
            "[00:40:46,600 --> 00:40:49,600]  they have now come back to Taiwan.\n",
            "[00:40:49,600 --> 00:40:51,600]  So they are looking for a piece of land\n",
            "[00:40:51,600 --> 00:40:55,600]  and they are looking for places to build their factories.\n",
            "[00:40:55,600 --> 00:40:59,600]  And we think this is the best time when they start from scratch,\n",
            "[00:40:59,600 --> 00:41:03,600]  once they put this mobility into their consideration at the beginning,\n",
            "[00:41:03,600 --> 00:41:05,600]  you know, from the get-go.\n",
            "[00:41:05,600 --> 00:41:09,600]  And then they can already become a small factory kind of set up\n",
            "[00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:12,600]  and that will provide them with the kind of flexibility\n",
            "[00:41:12,600 --> 00:41:15,600]  and intelligence that they will need in order to give their business\n",
            "[00:41:15,600 --> 00:41:20,600]  the kind of flexibility and agility they will need, right?\n",
            "[00:41:20,600 --> 00:41:26,600]  So we with Delta and Microsoft are building that solution together.\n",
            "[00:41:26,600 --> 00:41:32,600]  Now, if there is another company from another vertical\n",
            "[00:41:32,600 --> 00:41:34,600]  that is interested in this solution,\n",
            "[00:41:34,600 --> 00:41:38,600]  then of course it depends on the cost of how we, you know,\n",
            "[00:41:38,600 --> 00:41:40,600]  each piece that we come up with.\n",
            "[00:41:40,600 --> 00:41:45,600]  And there will be some of that as a one-time cost for the setup.\n",
            "[00:41:45,600 --> 00:41:47,600]  And then there may be some hardware involved,\n",
            "[00:41:47,600 --> 00:41:50,600]  like some of this equipment like AGV,\n",
            "[00:41:51,600 --> 00:41:56,600]  will be Delta's AGV product, things like that.\n",
            "[00:41:56,600 --> 00:41:57,600]  So it all varies.\n",
            "[00:41:57,600 --> 00:42:00,600]  But then, yes, because there is a connectivity involved,\n",
            "[00:42:00,600 --> 00:42:04,600]  so there will be recurring, you know, fees that will be, you know,\n",
            "[00:42:04,600 --> 00:42:07,600]  that is a communication layer that we will be collecting.\n",
            "[00:42:07,600 --> 00:42:09,600]  So it will be a mix.\n",
            "[00:42:09,600 --> 00:42:12,140]  It's a hybrid model.\n",
            "[00:42:12,140 --> 00:42:15,140]  And then we actually don't have that set up yet\n",
            "[00:42:15,140 --> 00:42:17,140]  as we are just building this first one.\n",
            "[00:42:18,140 --> 00:42:23,140]  But then going forward, then your question will be more clear to us.\n",
            "[00:42:23,140 --> 00:42:25,140]  But at this point we didn't start with, okay,\n",
            "[00:42:25,140 --> 00:42:27,140]  let's look at how we're going to share the profit and all that.\n",
            "[00:42:27,140 --> 00:42:30,140]  We are looking at how we build this solution together.\n",
            "[00:42:30,140 --> 00:42:34,140]  But then your question can be answered later once we get this deployed\n",
            "[00:42:34,140 --> 00:42:36,140]  and that we should be thinking about that.\n",
            "[00:42:36,140 --> 00:42:39,290]  Got it.\n",
            "[00:42:39,290 --> 00:42:42,880]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:47,880]  But I think it's important to know that our involvement is more than\n",
            "[00:42:47,880 --> 00:42:52,880]  just the communication layer or just collecting the monthly.\n",
            "[00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:56,880]  There is also, you know, managed service that we can provide\n",
            "[00:42:56,880 --> 00:42:58,880]  to run the network for them.\n",
            "[00:42:58,880 --> 00:43:03,880]  And then also, thirdly, when I was talking about the IT layer,\n",
            "[00:43:03,880 --> 00:43:07,880]  that would include the IoT, you know, the applications,\n",
            "[00:43:07,880 --> 00:43:10,880]  and then the dashboard, the data analytics.\n",
            "[00:43:10,880 --> 00:43:14,880]  And that's where, you know, Far East Zone would have a role to play\n",
            "[00:43:14,880 --> 00:43:16,880]  and that's where we would have added value.\n",
            "[00:43:16,880 --> 00:43:20,880]  And, therefore, our margin will have some in that layer as well.\n",
            "[00:43:20,880 --> 00:43:28,050]  It's more than just the communication technology based on the usage.\n",
            "[00:43:28,050 --> 00:43:29,050]  Thank you, President Xi.\n",
            "[00:43:29,050 --> 00:43:32,140]  And the next question is coming from James Wan, UBS.\n",
            "[00:43:32,140 --> 00:43:34,750]  Go ahead, please.\n",
            "[00:43:34,750 --> 00:43:35,750]  Good afternoon.\n",
            "[00:43:35,750 --> 00:43:36,750]  I've got just two questions.\n",
            "[00:43:36,750 --> 00:43:41,750]  The first one is on the 5G subs where you've seen a 12% uplift in offers.\n",
            "[00:43:41,750 --> 00:43:46,750]  So can I just check what the substantive subsidy level is for these customers\n",
            "[00:43:47,750 --> 00:43:50,750]  for 5G packages compared to where they were before?\n",
            "[00:43:50,750 --> 00:43:55,750]  So, in other words, net of handset subsidies, is the uplift still up\n",
            "[00:43:55,750 --> 00:43:57,750]  or is it flat?\n",
            "[00:43:57,750 --> 00:44:00,750]  Or maybe the increase is higher than the 12% that you've indicated.\n",
            "[00:44:00,750 --> 00:44:06,750]  And the next question is on the new economy growth of 26% this first half.\n",
            "[00:44:06,750 --> 00:44:10,750]  Can I just understand how much of it is driven by COVID?\n",
            "[00:44:10,750 --> 00:44:14,750]  You know, you talked about some hospital projects funded by the government.\n",
            "[00:44:14,750 --> 00:44:19,750]  Going forward, you know, assume the situation eases,\n",
            "[00:44:19,750 --> 00:44:23,750]  will the growth rate come off for the new economy business?\n",
            "[00:44:23,750 --> 00:44:26,680]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:44:26,680 --> 00:44:28,930]  Okay.\n",
            "[00:44:28,930 --> 00:44:30,930]  So you have two questions.\n",
            "[00:44:30,930 --> 00:44:33,930]  The first one is about the uplift, right?\n",
            "[00:44:33,930 --> 00:44:36,930]  So you were asking before and after.\n",
            "[00:44:36,930 --> 00:44:37,930]  Let me see.\n",
            "[00:44:37,930 --> 00:44:40,930]  Let's get to the details or we can provide that to you.\n",
            "[00:44:40,930 --> 00:44:43,930]  Maybe we can provide it to you later.\n",
            "[00:44:43,930 --> 00:44:47,930]  I think, well, first of all, I need to clarify.\n",
            "[00:44:47,930 --> 00:44:50,930]  When we were talking about the 12%,\n",
            "[00:44:50,930 --> 00:44:53,930]  we were looking at that same customer base.\n",
            "[00:44:53,930 --> 00:45:00,930]  So, in other words, for this past 28 days, those that came to renew.\n",
            "[00:45:00,930 --> 00:45:05,930]  And then, you know, before they renew, they have a price they pay for, right?\n",
            "[00:45:05,930 --> 00:45:11,930]  And after they renew, maybe they still renew as 4G customers or 4G rate plan\n",
            "[00:45:11,930 --> 00:45:15,930]  and they may even go down or go up or they may sign up for a 5G plan.\n",
            "[00:45:15,930 --> 00:45:19,930]  So that's how we compare the before and after the average.\n",
            "[00:45:19,930 --> 00:45:22,930]  And that's where we see the 12% increase.\n",
            "[00:45:22,930 --> 00:45:26,340]  So are we on the same page there?\n",
            "[00:45:26,340 --> 00:45:27,440]  Yep, sure.\n",
            "[00:45:27,440 --> 00:45:28,440]  Okay.\n",
            "[00:45:28,440 --> 00:45:29,440]  All right.\n",
            "[00:45:29,440 --> 00:45:31,440]  And then you were asking exactly how much that is?\n",
            "[00:45:31,440 --> 00:45:32,440]  Is that?\n",
            "[00:45:32,440 --> 00:45:40,440]  So what I'm asking is whether these customers had a lower handset subsidy before\n",
            "[00:45:40,440 --> 00:45:43,440]  and now they've got a higher handset subsidy.\n",
            "[00:45:43,440 --> 00:45:46,440]  And therefore, whether the net output to you guys.\n",
            "[00:45:46,440 --> 00:45:48,440]  Oh, okay, I see.\n",
            "[00:45:48,440 --> 00:45:52,440]  Or is it worse or is it better compared to the 12% we've seen?\n",
            "[00:45:52,440 --> 00:45:53,440]  Oh, I see, I see.\n",
            "[00:45:53,440 --> 00:45:54,440]  Oh, okay, I see, I see.\n",
            "[00:45:54,440 --> 00:46:00,440]  So, well, first of all, the different tiers of pricing, the subsidy will be different.\n",
            "[00:46:00,440 --> 00:46:03,440]  But then that is also what we did with 4G.\n",
            "[00:46:03,440 --> 00:46:09,440]  So if you compare the subsidy I would have paid for if this is on a 4G plan versus 5G,\n",
            "[00:46:09,440 --> 00:46:12,730]  that's about flat, tier by tier.\n",
            "[00:46:12,730 --> 00:46:20,840]  And then also the 4G subsidy at the same time, like I was saying,\n",
            "[00:46:20,840 --> 00:46:24,840]  we were shifting our dollars, right, our funding.\n",
            "[00:46:24,840 --> 00:46:28,840]  So what we would have paid for the 4G customers.\n",
            "[00:46:28,840 --> 00:46:32,840]  So this is also part of the reason why we said, you know, more people will convert.\n",
            "[00:46:32,840 --> 00:46:37,840]  Because if I were the customer, I will need to renew.\n",
            "[00:46:37,840 --> 00:46:40,840]  If I renew for 4G and then maybe I get a phone,\n",
            "[00:46:40,840 --> 00:46:46,840]  but then the phone I would get a subsidy versus what I would get if I just go straight to a 5G.\n",
            "[00:46:46,840 --> 00:46:52,840]  I will, of course, offer better for 5G and then offer less for 4G.\n",
            "[00:46:52,840 --> 00:46:59,840]  So, you know, you think 5G is better than 4G and not because I still keep 4G at the same level.\n",
            "[00:46:59,840 --> 00:47:03,840]  But it's like I take some of that to help with the 5G.\n",
            "[00:47:03,840 --> 00:47:06,840]  So I can differentiate the two more.\n",
            "[00:47:06,840 --> 00:47:13,190]  And then that will entice the users more, the subscribers.\n",
            "[00:47:13,190 --> 00:47:16,540]  Did I explain?\n",
            "[00:47:16,540 --> 00:47:23,540]  You're saying there will be more handset subsidies for the 5G packages compared to 4G.\n",
            "[00:47:23,540 --> 00:47:24,540]  Is that right?\n",
            "[00:47:24,540 --> 00:47:26,950]  Yeah, I think you can say that.\n",
            "[00:47:26,950 --> 00:47:28,950]  Okay, thank you.\n",
            "[00:47:28,950 --> 00:47:31,950]  And then that is because we adjusted down.\n",
            "[00:47:31,950 --> 00:47:37,950]  So it's not like at the same 4G level like before we have 5G services.\n",
            "[00:47:37,950 --> 00:47:41,480]  Okay, thank you.\n",
            "[00:47:41,480 --> 00:47:46,480]  Another opportunity for 5G is actually we will increase the bundling rate,\n",
            "[00:47:46,480 --> 00:47:51,700]  I mean bundling rate plan rate internally when our customers sign up.\n",
            "[00:47:51,700 --> 00:47:56,700]  Because we have a lot of people only sign up for the bundling rate plan for 4G.\n",
            "[00:47:56,700 --> 00:48:01,700]  So right now after they decide to upgrade to 5G, they have a handset demand.\n",
            "[00:48:01,700 --> 00:48:02,700]  Yeah, because.\n",
            "[00:48:02,700 --> 00:48:06,700]  They will sign up a higher rate plan for bundling rate plan.\n",
            "[00:48:06,700 --> 00:48:07,700]  Okay.\n",
            "[00:48:08,700 --> 00:48:13,700]  Because, well, 5G is a new technology.\n",
            "[00:48:13,700 --> 00:48:18,700]  You need a new phone for you to be able to use 5G.\n",
            "[00:48:18,700 --> 00:48:23,700]  So that certainly triggers the need, the more demand for 5G.\n",
            "[00:48:23,700 --> 00:48:26,700]  And like 4G has been around for many years, right?\n",
            "[00:48:26,700 --> 00:48:30,700]  So, you know, quite a few consumers when they do the renew,\n",
            "[00:48:30,700 --> 00:48:33,700]  they don't necessarily buy a new phone.\n",
            "[00:48:33,700 --> 00:48:37,700]  So we see more similar cases in the last year or two.\n",
            "[00:48:37,700 --> 00:48:39,700]  But then with 5G, that's different.\n",
            "[00:48:39,700 --> 00:48:41,700]  It's a new chapter now.\n",
            "[00:48:41,700 --> 00:48:44,700]  So we do see more, you know, device demands.\n",

            "[00:48:47,060 --> 00:48:50,060]  And then if it's up for bundling rate plan,\n",
            "[00:48:50,060 --> 00:48:53,500]  definitely higher than the bundling rate plan.\n",
            "[00:48:53,500 --> 00:48:54,500]  Okay.\n",
            "[00:48:54,500 --> 00:48:58,410]  And if it's a contribution.\n",
            "[00:48:58,410 --> 00:48:59,410]  Okay.\n",
            "[00:48:59,410 --> 00:49:10,580]  As a reminder, please press 01 on your keypad if you would like to ask a question.\n",

            "[00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:37,100]  And Gary, please begin.\n",
            "[00:00:37,100 --> 00:00:42,640]  Thank you everyone to attend Firestone's First Quarter 2020 Results Conference Call.\n",
            "[00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:48,640]  Today our President Xi and CFO Sherman both here participate in this call with us.\n",
            "[00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:54,640]  Before Xi's presentation, please pay attention to the State of Harvard Statement Universe page.\n",
            "[00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:56,640]  Let me pass it to Xi, please. Thank you.\n",
            "[00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:59,640]  Okay, good afternoon everyone and welcome to our call.\n",
            "[00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:05,640]  I would like to start our first quarter review with the market condition.\n",
            "[00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:15,180]  So as the chart and slide number three on the left, so the market mobile customers of the number of subscribers,\n",
            "[00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:23,180]  and this is according to our NCC data, it has been like a 29.2 million for two quarters in a row.\n",
            "[00:01:23,180 --> 00:01:25,180]  So it's pretty much stable.\n",
            "[00:01:25,180 --> 00:01:32,180]  And then on the other hand, FET for Easton, we continue to grow our post-pay customers.\n",
            "[00:01:32,180 --> 00:01:36,180]  And then at 1.2% year over year.\n",
            "[00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:42,180]  And then in terms of the mobile number portability, it also cooled down,\n",
            "[00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:47,180]  which is a good thing in a way because the post-pay churn is lower.\n",
            "[00:01:47,180 --> 00:01:52,180]  And then also that means the competition amount of the telcos.\n",
            "[00:01:52,180 --> 00:01:59,810]  So on the right-hand side, we keep hitting the churn rate.\n",
            "[00:01:59,810 --> 00:02:06,810]  The one month number, as I understood from my team, was like 1.06.\n",
            "[00:02:06,810 --> 00:02:11,840]  So it's even lower than this average, like 1.29.\n",
            "[00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:12,840]  All right.\n",
            "[00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:17,840]  If you turn to the next page, in terms of our operational performance,\n",
            "[00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:23,830]  as it has been reported recently in a newspaper talking to a number of subscribers,\n",
            "[00:02:23,830 --> 00:02:30,620]  we have been taking lead in terms of our approval blended and also post-paid.\n",
            "[00:02:30,620 --> 00:02:36,040]  And then we, for ourselves, we really look at the post-paid with more focus.\n",
            "[00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:37,040]  Okay.\n",
            "[00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:39,040]  It is now at 7.13.\n",
            "[00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:44,040]  And in terms of our customer satisfaction, so according to the third-party survey,\n",
            "[00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:49,040]  our customers, FET subscribers, their satisfaction with our network is better\n",
            "[00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:55,040]  than the other telcos, their own customers' satisfaction with their own network,\n",
            "[00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:56,040]  which is a good thing.\n",
            "[00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:59,040]  But then that also tells us we still have some work to do,\n",
            "[00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:03,040]  so hopefully more people will know about our quality of our network,\n",
            "[00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:09,040]  and then eventually or over time we'll get more subscribers to come join our network.\n",
            "[00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:10,040]  Okay.\n",
            "[00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:11,040]  All right.\n",
            "[00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:17,040]  In terms of our new economy, we have seen very impressive growth.\n",
            "[00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:22,040]  So first quarter 2020, over the same quarter last year,\n",
            "[00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:26,040]  we grew 44% in our overall new economy revenue.\n",
            "[00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:30,040]  And then on the right-hand side that we show several areas,\n",
            "[00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:34,040]  especially on the enterprise side, and so for our cloud service,\n",
            "[00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:39,040]  for the first quarter we grew 220% year over year.\n",
            "[00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:44,040]  And then even though we did acquire NextLink in March last year,\n",
            "[00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:49,040]  but then NextLink itself, it may have a 140% growth.\n",
            "[00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:55,040]  So this is a very solid cloud service growth that FET together collectively,\n",
            "[00:03:55,040 --> 00:04:01,040]  including the subsidiary company performance together.\n",
            "[00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:06,040]  And then for our IoT, we have almost 500% growth.\n",
            "[00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:09,040]  And then in terms of the system integration,\n",
            "[00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:15,040]  the SI area is a double-digit 11% growth year over year.\n",
            "[00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:19,040]  And then in the security area it's a 58%.\n",
            "[00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:23,040]  Even though, you know, with the virus, so some of the projects,\n",
            "[00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:28,040]  we were delayed in terms of finishing it because the clients wouldn't want us to\n",
            "[00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:31,040]  visit them at that time, so it delayed some of the project's conclusion.\n",
            "[00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:36,040]  But then even with that, we still show 58% of growth for the first quarter.\n",
            "[00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:42,580]  So now talk about the COVID-19 virus impact.\n",
            "[00:04:42,580 --> 00:04:46,580]  As everybody knows, the virus spread is more contained, luckily,\n",
            "[00:04:46,580 --> 00:04:48,580]  or under control in Taiwan.\n",
            "[00:04:48,580 --> 00:04:50,580]  We are very blessed for that.\n",
            "[00:04:50,580 --> 00:04:54,580]  And then there's still impact, right, across the board.\n",
            "[00:04:54,580 --> 00:04:58,580]  And then for FET, I think in telecom industry,\n",
            "[00:04:59,580 --> 00:05:04,580]  we are less impacted than some other, you know, like the restaurants\n",
            "[00:05:04,580 --> 00:05:08,580]  or tourist-related and then some of the manufacturing, right,\n",
            "[00:05:08,580 --> 00:05:10,580]  and then because of supply chain and all that.\n",
            "[00:05:10,580 --> 00:05:15,580]  So we are actually relatively okay, but still we are feeling the impact.\n",
            "[00:05:15,580 --> 00:05:19,580]  So, for example, the inbound, outbound roaming traffic, right,\n",
            "[00:05:19,580 --> 00:05:22,580]  and then also the revenue, although that itself only accounts\n",
            "[00:05:22,580 --> 00:05:26,580]  for a very small percent, like 1% of our service revenue.\n",
            "[00:05:26,580 --> 00:05:29,580]  So the decline there is not, you know,\n",
            "[00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:33,580]  compared to the total revenue we have, is not as significant.\n",
            "[00:05:33,580 --> 00:05:38,580]  And then also the prepaid car revenue, we also see the decline just because,\n",
            "[00:05:38,580 --> 00:05:42,580]  you know, there are less visitors, either tourists or business people.\n",
            "[00:05:42,580 --> 00:05:44,580]  It's just less.\n",
            "[00:05:44,580 --> 00:05:51,580]  But then the major reason for us to fall short on achieving our revenue\n",
            "[00:05:51,580 --> 00:05:55,580]  target is really mostly due to the device sales.\n",
            "[00:05:55,580 --> 00:05:58,580]  Right, and then that is because for several months in a row,\n",
            "[00:05:58,580 --> 00:06:02,580]  there were just no new handset models became available for us\n",
            "[00:06:02,580 --> 00:06:06,580]  to entice the customers, either with bundled offer\n",
            "[00:06:06,580 --> 00:06:09,580]  or just planning to sell the devices.\n",
            "[00:06:09,580 --> 00:06:13,580]  So we definitely have resulted in lower device sales\n",
            "[00:06:13,580 --> 00:06:15,580]  and then also the bundled sales.\n",
            "[00:06:15,580 --> 00:06:21,580]  So for the gross ad, so that impacted our revenue for first quarter.\n",
            "[00:06:21,580 --> 00:06:25,580]  But then in terms of the devices on supplies,\n",
            "[00:06:25,580 --> 00:06:28,580]  the good news is they are catching up.\n",
            "[00:06:28,580 --> 00:06:31,580]  So before summer and then there will be more of them\n",
            "[00:06:31,580 --> 00:06:36,580]  that will become available for our 5G launch in summer.\n",
            "[00:06:36,580 --> 00:06:41,580]  So that is definitely something we, you know, we keep a close eye on.\n",
            "[00:06:41,580 --> 00:06:44,580]  Okay, but for everything that we know at this point,\n",
            "[00:06:44,580 --> 00:06:46,580]  the supplies are coming.\n",
            "[00:06:46,580 --> 00:06:48,580]  Okay, the supplies are coming.\n",
            "[00:06:48,580 --> 00:06:52,580]  And also, but then that's all kind of on the more on the negative side.\n",
            "[00:06:52,580 --> 00:06:57,870]  But then because of the virus and then people now, not only people,\n",
            "[00:06:57,870 --> 00:06:59,870]  the industry, right, the enterprises,\n",
            "[00:06:59,870 --> 00:07:04,870]  they definitely see the need for remote working, for video conferencing.\n",
            "[00:07:04,870 --> 00:07:11,160]  And then so we do have increased enterprise demand for video conferencing\n",
            "[00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:15,160]  or related digital capability solutions.\n",
            "[00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:20,900]  We saw lots of increase and also of orders in this area for our enterprise.\n",
            "[00:07:20,900 --> 00:07:23,930]  And then also there is a request for more bandwidth\n",
            "[00:07:23,930 --> 00:07:29,930]  because more people now working from home or more remote working kind of need.\n",
            "[00:07:29,930 --> 00:07:32,930]  So that did give us a little bit uplift.\n",
            "[00:07:32,930 --> 00:07:36,930]  And then we also, as more people now,\n",
            "[00:07:36,930 --> 00:07:38,930]  they really cannot have much entertainment.\n",
            "[00:07:38,930 --> 00:07:41,930]  They cannot eat out or they couldn't eat out.\n",
            "[00:07:41,930 --> 00:07:42,930]  They stay home.\n",
            "[00:07:42,930 --> 00:07:43,930]  And so what do they do?\n",
            "[00:07:43,930 --> 00:07:49,930]  Especially after the Chinese New Year, I remember when the first kind of breakout.\n",
            "[00:07:49,930 --> 00:07:53,930]  So we do see the data usage, right, you know, serves up.\n",
            "[00:07:53,930 --> 00:07:56,930]  And then overall it's increased about 10%.\n",
            "[00:07:56,930 --> 00:08:00,930]  But then when people during peak hour and all that, you do see, you know,\n",
            "[00:08:00,930 --> 00:08:05,930]  like we probably have more congested periods of time.\n",
            "[00:08:05,930 --> 00:08:08,930]  So we do get more complaints from the users, you know,\n",
            "[00:08:08,930 --> 00:08:11,930]  just because they were not used to be staying home that long.\n",
            "[00:08:11,930 --> 00:08:14,930]  And then also the indoor coverage is always a little bit more limited\n",
            "[00:08:14,930 --> 00:08:16,930]  than the outdoor coverage.\n",
            "[00:08:16,930 --> 00:08:18,930]  So we see more complaints.\n",
            "[00:08:18,930 --> 00:08:22,930]  And then now if you ask me, so the more data usage\n",
            "[00:08:22,930 --> 00:08:26,930]  is resulting in the more dollars, not quite so.\n",
            "[00:08:26,930 --> 00:08:30,930]  And because if you remember, we have the famous unlimited data plan, right,\n",
            "[00:08:30,930 --> 00:08:32,930]  and the 499.\n",
            "[00:08:32,930 --> 00:08:33,930]  So that really hurts us.\n",
            "[00:08:33,930 --> 00:08:38,930]  This is where you could see you could use more revenue if the volume goes up.\n",
            "[00:08:38,930 --> 00:08:43,930]  But then that wasn't quite the case because a high percentage of our subscribers\n",
            "[00:08:43,930 --> 00:08:46,930]  were on those unlimited data plans.\n",
            "[00:08:46,930 --> 00:08:47,930]  Okay.\n",
            "[00:08:47,930 --> 00:08:48,930]  All right.\n",
            "[00:08:48,930 --> 00:08:50,930]  And with that, I'm going to turn to Sherman, my CFO,\n",
            "[00:08:50,930 --> 00:08:54,930]  to talk about some financial details for your information.\n",
            "[00:08:54,930 --> 00:08:56,930]  Good afternoon, everyone.\n",
            "[00:08:56,930 --> 00:08:59,930]  Now let's turn to page nine.\n",
            "[00:08:59,930 --> 00:09:02,930]  Let's look at some percentage numbers here.\n",
            "[00:09:02,930 --> 00:09:06,930]  First is the EBITDA margin and percentage.\n",
            "[00:09:06,930 --> 00:09:12,090]  The EBITDA for first quarter this year is $7.003 billion,\n",
            "[00:09:12,090 --> 00:09:17,090]  but the margin percentage gets higher to 36.1%.\n",
            "[00:09:17,090 --> 00:09:22,310]  One of the reasons is the revenue shortage comes from handset sales,\n",
            "[00:09:22,310 --> 00:09:24,310]  which is a lower margin.\n",
            "[00:09:24,310 --> 00:09:27,310]  So because of that kind of a revenue decrease,\n",
            "[00:09:27,310 --> 00:09:31,310]  we still have a good EBITDA margin percentage.\n",
            "[00:09:32,310 --> 00:09:35,310]  And then for net income,\n",
            "[00:09:35,310 --> 00:09:40,310]  actually our first quarter net income is higher than last quarter,\n",
            "[00:09:40,310 --> 00:09:46,310]  and that gives us an even higher net income margin.\n",
            "[00:09:46,310 --> 00:09:50,310]  That is 11.2% for the same reason as EBITDA margin.\n",
            "[00:09:50,310 --> 00:09:54,310]  Now the next page is our financial results.\n",
            "[00:09:54,310 --> 00:09:57,310]  And for the total revenue for first quarter,\n",
            "[00:09:57,310 --> 00:10:01,310]  we have $19.389 billion.\n",
            "[00:10:01,310 --> 00:10:05,310]  That is 97% of our guidance achievement.\n",
            "[00:10:05,310 --> 00:10:11,310]  And our operating expense is $3.74 billion.\n",
            "[00:10:11,310 --> 00:10:14,310]  That is 5% lower than our guidance.\n",
            "[00:10:14,310 --> 00:10:17,310]  And our EBITDA, as we explained previously,\n",
            "[00:10:17,310 --> 00:10:20,310]  it is higher, 2% higher than our guidance.\n",
            "[00:10:21,310 --> 00:10:24,310]  And the net income is 3% higher.\n",
            "[00:10:33,130 --> 00:10:36,130]  Next page, let's look at our financial status.\n",
            "[00:10:36,130 --> 00:10:40,130]  Our cash and cash equipment is okay,\n",
            "[00:10:40,130 --> 00:10:42,130]  but if we look at the total borrowing,\n",
            "[00:10:42,130 --> 00:10:47,130]  I think the highlight is we significantly increased our total borrowing\n",
            "[00:10:47,130 --> 00:10:51,130]  from last quarter's $35.5 billion.\n",
            "[00:10:51,130 --> 00:10:53,130]  Now it is $69.1 billion.\n",
            "[00:10:53,130 --> 00:10:58,130]  That is because we have to pay $40 billion for spectrum,\n",
            "[00:10:58,130 --> 00:11:02,130]  5G spectrum, early first quarter this year.\n",
            "[00:11:02,130 --> 00:11:09,130]  And our shareholders' equity increased from $70.6 billion to $72.78 billion,\n",
            "[00:11:09,130 --> 00:11:15,960]  a normal increase because of the earnings made in first quarter.\n",
            "[00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:25,960]  And our net debt to EBITDA increased from $0.91 times to $2.17 times of EBITDA.\n",
            "[00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:30,960]  However, we still have a very sound financial standing\n",
            "[00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:33,960]  and our liquidity, everything is okay.\n",
            "[00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:39,960]  And our pre-cash flow is $7.095 for the first quarter.\n",
            "[00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:44,960]  If you look at last year, it is $15.256.\n",
            "[00:11:46,060 --> 00:11:51,060]  The reason we have a very high pre-cash flow on first quarter,\n",
            "[00:11:51,060 --> 00:11:52,060]  several reasons.\n",
            "[00:11:52,060 --> 00:11:57,060]  One is we have tax return from tax bureau.\n",
            "[00:11:57,060 --> 00:11:58,060]  That's the first one.\n",
            "[00:11:58,060 --> 00:12:06,060]  And second is our capex spending for the first quarter is lower than the planning.\n",
            "[00:12:06,060 --> 00:12:08,060]  It's only $1.0 billion.\n",
            "[00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:12,060]  And another reason is our significant reduction in working capital\n",
            "[00:12:12,060 --> 00:12:17,060]  from reduced accounts receivable and reduced inventory.\n",
            "[00:12:17,060 --> 00:12:21,060]  So that's why we have a very strong pre-cash flow for the first quarter,\n",
            "[00:12:21,060 --> 00:12:25,860]  but that is like one-time event.\n",
            "[00:12:25,860 --> 00:12:27,860]  And then that's the end for the financial highlight.\n",
            "[00:12:27,860 --> 00:12:30,860]  I'll return the business update to Chief.\n",
            "[00:12:30,860 --> 00:12:32,860]  Okay.\n",
            "[00:12:32,860 --> 00:12:34,860]  So although this is the first quarter,\n",
            "[00:12:34,860 --> 00:12:40,860]  I figure for those that highlight we already have received,\n",
            "[00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:43,860]  I might just share them with you just to be timely.\n",
            "[00:12:43,860 --> 00:12:47,860]  So this highlight is some of that happened in second quarter,\n",
            "[00:12:47,860 --> 00:12:51,860]  so I just rename it to the year-to-date highlight for you.\n",
            "[00:12:51,860 --> 00:12:53,860]  And then as you might have heard,\n",
            "[00:12:53,860 --> 00:12:57,860]  we have won the DGSI Best Mover for Telecom Industry Award.\n",
            "[00:12:57,860 --> 00:13:01,860]  And then we also ranked among top five companies\n",
            "[00:13:01,860 --> 00:13:06,860]  for 2019 Corporate Governance Evaluation by Taiwan Stock Exchange.\n",
            "[00:13:06,860 --> 00:13:08,860]  This is six years in a row.\n",
            "[00:13:08,860 --> 00:13:13,860]  And then we were also approved for a 5G business plan security plan\n",
            "[00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:16,860]  and received construction permits from the NCC,\n",
            "[00:13:16,860 --> 00:13:19,860]  and we already started our initial phase rollout.\n",
            "[00:13:19,860 --> 00:13:21,860]  Okay.\n",
            "[00:13:21,860 --> 00:13:25,860]  And then we also signed our first 5G enterprise network client.\n",
            "[00:13:25,860 --> 00:13:28,860]  I believe this will be the first probably among the telcos.\n",
            "[00:13:28,860 --> 00:13:31,860]  And it's a leading tech company.\n",
            "[00:13:31,860 --> 00:13:36,860]  And then we also supported NCC and our CDC effort\n",
            "[00:13:36,860 --> 00:13:39,860]  to contain the COVID-19 virus.\n",
            "[00:13:39,860 --> 00:13:42,860]  So we actually provided a cloud and network infrastructure\n",
            "[00:13:42,860 --> 00:13:47,860]  to ensure this e-mask ordering system is scalable\n",
            "[00:13:47,860 --> 00:13:51,860]  and so they can cope with the anticipated demand.\n",
            "[00:13:51,860 --> 00:13:55,860]  And then on the other hand, as some of you may have heard,\n",
            "[00:13:55,860 --> 00:14:00,860]  that we have this geofencing capability that we were helping the CDC\n",
            "[00:14:00,860 --> 00:14:04,860]  to track down and to make sure those quarantined folks\n",
            "[00:14:04,860 --> 00:14:06,860]  stay where they should be.\n",
            "[00:14:06,860 --> 00:14:10,860]  And then, you know, we actually have provided very good support,\n",
            "[00:14:10,860 --> 00:14:13,860]  and it was over 99% accuracy.\n",
            "[00:14:13,860 --> 00:14:15,860]  And if I may add, as I understand,\n",
            "[00:14:15,860 --> 00:14:19,860]  we were the best among the five in terms of the service.\n",
            "[00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:20,860]  Okay.\n",
            "[00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:23,860]  And then for our second quarter focus, of course,\n",
            "[00:14:23,860 --> 00:14:26,860]  we can continue to build out our 5G network,\n",
            "[00:14:26,860 --> 00:14:31,860]  and then we're still on the same schedule for summer launch.\n",
            "[00:14:31,860 --> 00:14:36,860]  And then so we're going to start our pre-launch warm-ups activity soon.\n",
            "[00:14:36,860 --> 00:14:37,860]  Okay.\n",
            "[00:14:37,860 --> 00:14:40,860]  And then we will continue to enhance and reach\n",
            "[00:14:40,860 --> 00:14:42,860]  and accelerate our digital services.\n",
            "[00:14:42,860 --> 00:14:47,860]  As you see, our new economy in general, right, grew 44%.\n",
            "[00:14:47,860 --> 00:14:52,860]  That includes the digital services as well, like our EC, which is still small,\n",
            "[00:14:52,860 --> 00:14:55,860]  but then we are encouraged to see the kind of growth\n",
            "[00:14:55,860 --> 00:14:58,860]  that we just need to do better and do more.\n",
            "[00:14:58,860 --> 00:15:01,890]  And then on the other hand, on the ICT side,\n",
            "[00:15:01,890 --> 00:15:04,890]  you saw some of the numbers I shared with you.\n",
            "[00:15:04,890 --> 00:15:10,890]  So I think inevitably with the global economy,\n",
            "[00:15:10,890 --> 00:15:12,890]  since we are part of the global economy,\n",
            "[00:15:12,890 --> 00:15:16,890]  I would say eventually we probably will see some of this slowing down,\n",
            "[00:15:16,890 --> 00:15:21,890]  but then until then we still continue to work really hard\n",
            "[00:15:21,890 --> 00:15:25,890]  on our enterprise-related, ICT-related business.\n",
            "[00:15:26,890 --> 00:15:32,890]  And then so like even with 5G, we had previously several POCs,\n",
            "[00:15:32,890 --> 00:15:38,890]  and we will try to nail down all those deals as well so we won't slow down.\n",
            "[00:15:38,890 --> 00:15:44,890]  And then we will optimize our channel strategy to drive the 5G adoption.\n",
            "[00:15:44,890 --> 00:15:50,890]  And then also as we do see it's getting more challenging, you know,\n",
            "[00:15:50,890 --> 00:15:54,890]  to see the growth in revenue with all this global economy\n",
            "[00:15:54,890 --> 00:15:57,890]  and then the local economy situation.\n",
            "[00:15:57,890 --> 00:16:01,890]  And then so it's extremely important that we control\n",
            "[00:16:01,890 --> 00:16:03,890]  and then cut our costs and expense.\n",
            "[00:16:03,890 --> 00:16:07,890]  And then so that is, and here I put it at the bottom,\n",
            "[00:16:07,890 --> 00:16:10,890]  actually for my internal communication, that was our top one item.\n",
            "[00:16:10,890 --> 00:16:15,890]  We want to make sure every employee of FDT understands, you know,\n",
            "[00:16:15,890 --> 00:16:17,890]  for every penny that we spend,\n",
            "[00:16:17,890 --> 00:16:22,890]  we really need to know that it is really worth the efforts, right?\n",
            "[00:16:22,890 --> 00:16:25,890]  So we are very cautious about the cost and expense,\n",
            "[00:16:25,890 --> 00:16:29,890]  and we are doing everything to make sure that the money is well spent\n",
            "[00:16:29,890 --> 00:16:33,890]  and for the kind of return that we're expecting.\n",
            "[00:16:33,890 --> 00:16:36,890]  With that, I think that concluded our presentation,\n",
            "[00:16:36,890 --> 00:16:39,370]  and then we welcome your questions.\n",
            "[00:16:39,370 --> 00:16:40,370]  Thank you, President Xi.\n",
            "[00:16:40,370 --> 00:16:44,370]  And ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin our question and answer session.\n",
            "[00:16:44,370 --> 00:16:47,370]  If you have a question for any of today's speakers,\n",
            "[00:16:47,370 --> 00:16:52,370]  please press 01 on your telephone keypad and you will enter the queue.\n",
            "[00:16:52,370 --> 00:16:55,370]  After you are announced, please ask your question.\n",
            "[00:16:55,370 --> 00:16:59,370]  If you find that your question has been answered before it is your turn to speak,\n",
            "[00:16:59,370 --> 00:17:02,370]  please press 02 to cancel the question.\n",
            "[00:17:02,370 --> 00:17:03,370]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:17:03,370 --> 00:17:13,860]  And the first question is coming from James Wong of UBS.\n",
            "[00:17:13,860 --> 00:17:15,020]  Go ahead, please.\n",
            "[00:17:15,020 --> 00:17:16,020]  Good afternoon.\n",
            "[00:17:16,020 --> 00:17:18,020]  So I've got three questions.\n",
            "[00:17:18,020 --> 00:17:21,020]  The first question is just around the operating cost.\n",
            "[00:17:21,020 --> 00:17:23,020]  So I've noticed that service revenue,\n",
            "[00:17:23,020 --> 00:17:28,020]  so that excludes the hardware revenue, that's down 1% year on year,\n",
            "[00:17:28,020 --> 00:17:32,020]  but EBITDA is down a lot more, down 6%.\n",
            "[00:17:32,020 --> 00:17:33,020]  So I'm just wondering,\n",
            "[00:17:33,020 --> 00:17:37,020]  what's driving the operating cost to grow faster than revenue?\n",
            "[00:17:37,020 --> 00:17:38,020]  Is that mostly 5G related\n",
            "[00:17:38,020 --> 00:17:42,020]  or the costs associated with the data capacity increase\n",
            "[00:17:42,020 --> 00:17:45,020]  that the President talked about?\n",
            "[00:17:45,020 --> 00:17:48,020]  The second question is just around the new economy business.\n",
            "[00:17:48,020 --> 00:17:50,020]  That's been growing very strongly,\n",
            "[00:17:50,020 --> 00:17:54,020]  but could you give us a sense of the profitability of that business?\n",
            "[00:17:54,020 --> 00:17:57,020]  So, you know, when you share from the incumbent,\n",
            "[00:17:57,020 --> 00:18:01,020]  the concern will be you are sacrificing margin\n",
            "[00:18:01,020 --> 00:18:04,020]  or potentially making losses in order to do that.\n",
            "[00:18:04,020 --> 00:18:06,020]  And also, apart from price,\n",
            "[00:18:06,020 --> 00:18:09,020]  how are you differentiating versus the incumbent?\n",
            "[00:18:09,020 --> 00:18:12,020]  And the third question is just around the mobile business.\n",
            "[00:18:12,020 --> 00:18:14,020]  So we've come to the two-year anniversary\n",
            "[00:18:14,020 --> 00:18:17,020]  of when the 499 plan was first launched.\n",
            "[00:18:17,020 --> 00:18:20,020]  So how are you incentivizing these customers\n",
            "[00:18:20,020 --> 00:18:22,020]  to stay with you for another two years?\n",
            "[00:18:22,020 --> 00:18:24,020]  Are you offering further discounts?\n",
            "[00:18:24,020 --> 00:18:26,020]  And what proportion of the customer base\n",
            "[00:18:26,020 --> 00:18:30,020]  have you already moved on to the new plans?\n",
            "[00:18:30,020 --> 00:18:35,490]  Okay, I'll answer the first question.\n",
            "[00:18:35,490 --> 00:18:41,780]  Operating expense, actually, it is lower than our budget by 5%.\n",
            "[00:18:41,780 --> 00:18:45,450]  The handset sales is lower than our expectations.\n",
            "[00:18:46,450 --> 00:18:53,070]  So, actually, we save quite commissions and that is that\n",
            "[00:18:53,070 --> 00:18:59,530]  if we compare operating expenses,\n",
            "[00:18:59,530 --> 00:19:07,170]  so actually our headcount-related operating expenses\n",
            "[00:19:07,170 --> 00:19:08,170]  is higher than last year.\n",
            "[00:19:08,170 --> 00:19:13,170]  But because of the handset sales lower than expectations,\n",
            "[00:19:13,170 --> 00:19:21,140]  so that costs some savings from our operating expense.\n",
            "[00:19:21,140 --> 00:19:22,140]  And for the second question...\n",
            "[00:19:22,140 --> 00:19:27,190]  Yeah, so the new economy that we are looking at,\n",
            "[00:19:27,190 --> 00:19:32,670]  on the IT side, the gross margin is about 13%.\n",
            "[00:19:32,670 --> 00:19:35,540]  And then on the digital services side,\n",
            "[00:19:35,540 --> 00:19:39,540]  the gross margin is actually higher and is close to 50%.\n",
            "[00:19:39,540 --> 00:19:44,540]  So the average we are looking at is about 30% for the new economy.\n",
            "[00:19:44,540 --> 00:19:46,950]  Okay, and I think you have...\n",
            "[00:19:46,950 --> 00:19:49,950]  Did that answer your question for the second one, sir?\n",
            "[00:19:49,950 --> 00:19:50,950]  Yes, yes.\n",
            "[00:19:50,950 --> 00:19:51,950]  Okay.\n",
            "[00:19:51,950 --> 00:19:53,950]  And I think the third one you were asking about,\n",
            "[00:19:53,950 --> 00:19:56,950]  the 499 is going to be the second anniversary\n",
            "[00:19:56,950 --> 00:19:59,950]  and then people that signed for 24 months\n",
            "[00:19:59,950 --> 00:20:02,950]  probably due for renewal or, you know, churns, right?\n",
            "[00:20:02,950 --> 00:20:05,950]  And then what are we doing to cope with that?\n",
            "[00:20:05,950 --> 00:20:09,950]  So the timing is such that this is also where we are actually,\n",
            "[00:20:09,950 --> 00:20:15,950]  you know, asking our subscribers to consider the 5G.\n",
            "[00:20:15,950 --> 00:20:19,950]  So that is kind of combined together with our 5G offers,\n",
            "[00:20:19,950 --> 00:20:21,950]  so like early bird offers.\n",
            "[00:20:22,950 --> 00:20:27,950]  So this is looked at not just like from one angle, you know,\n",
            "[00:20:27,950 --> 00:20:31,950]  because everybody knows and then everybody would expect, you know,\n",
            "[00:20:31,950 --> 00:20:33,950]  because of 5G there will be different offers.\n",
            "[00:20:33,950 --> 00:20:35,950]  So we kind of combined this together.\n",
            "[00:20:35,950 --> 00:20:41,950]  Now in terms of exact number or percentage of how many that are up for\n",
            "[00:20:41,950 --> 00:20:45,950]  renewal, that we don't really have a number offhand.\n",
            "[00:20:45,950 --> 00:20:49,950]  And also I think one common practice is you don't really wait\n",
            "[00:20:49,950 --> 00:20:54,950]  until the expiration date to do the renewal.\n",
            "[00:20:54,950 --> 00:20:55,950]  People do it sooner.\n",
            "[00:20:55,950 --> 00:20:59,950]  So are you using two months ahead or three months or four months?\n",
            "[00:20:59,950 --> 00:21:00,950]  So that number can change.\n",
            "[00:21:00,950 --> 00:21:04,950]  So I don't think we have that number, but I could ask,\n",
            "[00:21:04,950 --> 00:21:06,950]  but I don't have it handy.\n",
            "[00:21:06,950 --> 00:21:09,950]  But then to answer your question in a short way,\n",
            "[00:21:09,950 --> 00:21:14,950]  we are combining all these together with how we are going to encourage\n",
            "[00:21:14,950 --> 00:21:17,950]  our subscribers to sign up for 5G as early bird.\n",
            "[00:21:17,950 --> 00:21:20,950]  So those are kind of conceded together in our offering design.\n",
            "[00:21:20,950 --> 00:21:21,950]  Got it.\n",
            "[00:21:21,950 --> 00:21:24,010]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:21:24,010 --> 00:21:25,230]  Sure.\n",
            "[00:21:25,230 --> 00:21:33,680]  And the next question is coming from Danny Chu of Bank of America.\n",
            "[00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:34,680]  Go ahead, please.\n",
            "[00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:37,930]  Hi, home management.\n",
            "[00:21:37,930 --> 00:21:38,930]  Thank you for the presentation.\n",
            "[00:21:38,930 --> 00:21:40,930]  Just three quick questions.\n",
            "[00:21:40,930 --> 00:21:43,930]  First actually is also about the 5G.\n",
            "[00:21:43,930 --> 00:21:49,930]  Earlier on you mentioned that due to the offering of the unlimited data\n",
            "[00:21:50,930 --> 00:21:56,930]  plans that limit the company's ability to monetize the revenue opportunity.\n",
            "[00:21:56,930 --> 00:22:02,930]  So should we assume when 5G is launched at the very beginning,\n",
            "[00:22:02,930 --> 00:22:07,930]  the company is not going to offer so-called unlimited mobile data plan\n",
            "[00:22:07,930 --> 00:22:09,930]  under the 5G offering?\n",
            "[00:22:09,930 --> 00:22:11,930]  That's my first question.\n",
            "[00:22:11,930 --> 00:22:15,930]  Second question actually is about the CAPEX budget.\n",
            "[00:22:15,930 --> 00:22:20,930]  The company budget about $10 billion NT this year for CAPEX.\n",
            "[00:22:20,930 --> 00:22:26,930]  Given with the coronavirus, more and more people are working from home\n",
            "[00:22:26,930 --> 00:22:30,930]  and potentially going forward that would be the trend as well.\n",
            "[00:22:30,930 --> 00:22:36,930]  So we assume the CAPEX budget for this year as well as going forward\n",
            "[00:22:36,930 --> 00:22:41,930]  will be changed because of the working habits being changed as well.\n",
            "[00:22:41,930 --> 00:22:46,930]  And last question is in terms of the increased borrowing taken up by the\n",
            "[00:22:46,930 --> 00:22:51,930]  company, can we have a rough idea of roughly what is the interest rate\n",
            "[00:22:51,930 --> 00:22:52,930]  that we are paying?\n",
            "[00:22:52,930 --> 00:23:00,170]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:23:00,170 --> 00:23:03,170]  Okay, for the first question, that's a tough one, yeah.\n",
            "[00:23:03,170 --> 00:23:09,170]  And if you ask me, I would say, well, no more unlimited.\n",
            "[00:23:09,170 --> 00:23:11,170]  I wish I could just say that.\n",
            "[00:23:11,170 --> 00:23:15,170]  But then, as you know, there are five telcos here, right?\n",
            "[00:23:15,170 --> 00:23:22,170]  So setting the price has a lot to do what the market setter will do,\n",
            "[00:23:22,170 --> 00:23:25,170]  which will be our peer, Chunhua.\n",
            "[00:23:25,170 --> 00:23:30,170]  But then I think every telco understands the pain.\n",
            "[00:23:30,170 --> 00:23:38,390]  And also my personal concern is really there are still many applications\n",
            "[00:23:38,390 --> 00:23:44,390]  yet to be seen that will be developed for taking advantage of 5G's, you know,\n",
            "[00:23:44,390 --> 00:23:46,390]  big bandwidth, right?\n",
            "[00:23:46,390 --> 00:23:51,390]  So when we talk about unlimited, we really don't know what we are talking about.\n",
            "[00:23:51,390 --> 00:23:56,390]  And that is like, you know, you write a blank check.\n",
            "[00:23:56,390 --> 00:24:04,390]  So that is my concern when we just offer unconditional unlimited data plan.\n",
            "[00:24:04,390 --> 00:24:09,390]  And instead, I think, or in lieu, you know, knowing today, you know,\n",
            "[00:24:09,390 --> 00:24:18,500]  we actually have it in the news, right?\n",
            "[00:24:18,500 --> 00:24:21,500]  Taiwan is both in terms of the data usage, right, globally.\n",
            "[00:24:21,500 --> 00:24:28,500]  So it's like a 23 or 20-something gigabytes per month, right, or almost 30.\n",
            "[00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:29,500]  So it is high.\n",
            "[00:24:29,500 --> 00:24:31,500]  But then still, that is a number.\n",
            "[00:24:31,500 --> 00:24:34,500]  So you know, at least you can reference.\n",
            "[00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:35,500]  It's a good reference point.\n",
            "[00:24:35,500 --> 00:24:39,500]  But then for 5G, from what we already saw in Korea,\n",
            "[00:24:39,500 --> 00:24:42,500]  we know it definitely has increased their data usage.\n",
            "[00:24:42,500 --> 00:24:45,500]  But they also did not offer unlimited.\n",
            "[00:24:45,500 --> 00:24:48,500]  Or I said their unlimited was very high priced.\n",
            "[00:24:48,500 --> 00:24:51,500]  It was not a popular plan in Korea.\n",
            "[00:24:51,500 --> 00:24:58,500]  So the jump there is still pretty limited because it's kind of contained in a way.\n",
            "[00:24:58,500 --> 00:25:02,500]  But then if we continue this unlimited, you don't know how much more, you know,\n",
            "[00:25:02,500 --> 00:25:05,500]  bandwidth that this is going to drive up the usage.\n",
            "[00:25:05,500 --> 00:25:09,500]  So I think spectrum is very, you know, scarce resource.\n",
            "[00:25:09,500 --> 00:25:11,500]  And then it really should be best utilized.\n",
            "[00:25:11,500 --> 00:25:15,500]  And then when we know how we are using it and if there are alternatives,\n",
            "[00:25:15,500 --> 00:25:20,500]  people should, you know, look at what is the best optimal way of doing it.\n",
            "[00:25:20,500 --> 00:25:25,500]  So I, you know, as I advise my team,\n",
            "[00:25:25,500 --> 00:25:30,500]  we shouldn't just go out and offer unlimited because there are so many unknowns.\n",
            "[00:25:30,500 --> 00:25:34,500]  And I really don't think that telco as a whole should do that either.\n",
            "[00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:37,500]  And we should be very careful before anybody offers that.\n",
            "[00:25:37,500 --> 00:25:39,500]  That is still my position.\n",
            "[00:25:39,500 --> 00:25:43,500]  But then now would I change if all my, you know, peers are offering it?\n",
            "[00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:45,500]  Can I just like stand alone?\n",
            "[00:25:45,500 --> 00:25:47,500]  I don't think so.\n",
            "[00:25:47,500 --> 00:25:50,500]  But it is certainly not something, you know,\n",
            "[00:25:50,500 --> 00:25:53,720]  I would be happy to offer an unlimited plan.\n",
            "[00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:56,030]  Okay.\n",
            "[00:25:56,030 --> 00:25:57,030]  Okay.\n",
            "[00:25:57,030 --> 00:26:01,260]  Then for the second question, our CAPEX plan for DC is still unchanged.\n",
            "[00:26:01,260 --> 00:26:04,260]  We still plan to spend $10 million.\n",
            "[00:26:04,260 --> 00:26:07,260]  And then a significant portion of that will go to 5G.\n",
            "[00:26:07,260 --> 00:26:11,260]  And on the interest rate, our corporate bond interest rate,\n",
            "[00:26:11,260 --> 00:26:14,260]  the latest is around 0.7%.\n",
            "[00:26:14,260 --> 00:26:18,480]  And it depends on different lending facilities.\n",
            "[00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:24,850]  I would expect interest rate to be between 1%.\n",
            "[00:26:24,850 --> 00:26:29,850]  I would be surprised if we have to borrow anything above 1% interest rate.\n",
            "[00:26:29,850 --> 00:26:33,850]  So I would say lower than 1% should be our borrowing rate.\n",
            "[00:26:33,850 --> 00:26:34,850]  Yeah.\n",
            "[00:26:34,850 --> 00:26:38,850]  And I think there's a second part of your second question about the CAPEX.\n",
            "[00:26:38,850 --> 00:26:42,850]  Is that going to be affected by the working habit?\n",
            "[00:26:42,850 --> 00:26:44,850]  If I understand you correctly,\n",
            "[00:26:44,850 --> 00:26:47,850]  actually the fact that more people seem to be accepting\n",
            "[00:26:47,850 --> 00:26:51,850]  or more companies are accepting the remote working\n",
            "[00:26:51,850 --> 00:26:55,850]  or remote conferencing kind of work style,\n",
            "[00:26:55,850 --> 00:27:00,850]  that actually would accelerate the enterprise needs\n",
            "[00:27:00,850 --> 00:27:03,850]  or demand for digital transformation\n",
            "[00:27:03,850 --> 00:27:07,850]  or needing more capacity from a telecommunication perspective.\n",
            "[00:27:07,850 --> 00:27:10,850]  So for us, that means that we should invest more.\n",
            "[00:27:10,850 --> 00:27:14,850]  So in terms of the CAPEX influence,\n",
            "[00:27:14,850 --> 00:27:19,850]  I think if anything it's positively correlated\n",
            "[00:27:19,850 --> 00:27:23,850]  and not because of the remote working we will reduce our CAPEX,\n",
            "[00:27:23,850 --> 00:27:30,890]  if that's what you were alluding to.\n",
            "[00:27:30,890 --> 00:27:32,820]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:27:32,820 --> 00:27:36,150]  Sure.\n",
            "[00:27:36,150 --> 00:27:37,150]  If you would like to ask a question,\n",
            "[00:27:37,150 --> 00:27:42,620]  please press 01 on your telephone keypad.\n",
            "[00:27:42,620 --> 00:27:46,620]  And now we'll have Jack Hsieh of SinoPAC for questions.\n",
            "[00:27:46,620 --> 00:27:47,620]  Go ahead, please.\n",
            "[00:27:47,620 --> 00:27:53,730]  Thank you for giving me the chance to ask questions.\n",
            "[00:27:53,730 --> 00:27:55,950]  I have two questions.\n",
            "[00:27:55,950 --> 00:27:56,950]  My first question,\n",
            "[00:27:56,950 --> 00:28:02,950]  would you give us more color about your comfortable box details?\n",
            "[00:28:02,950 --> 00:28:09,950]  So when will we finish the whole process\n",
            "[00:28:09,950 --> 00:28:13,050]  and we'll file the code of bound?\n",
            "[00:28:13,050 --> 00:28:18,560]  And my second question is about\n",
            "[00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:23,560]  what's our plan for our 5G deployment?\n",
            "[00:28:23,560 --> 00:28:32,560]  I mean, do we plan how many base stations we'll deploy in this year?\n",
            "[00:28:32,560 --> 00:28:40,560]  How many base stations we'll deploy until the end of the next year?\n",
            "[00:28:40,560 --> 00:28:41,560]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:28:41,560 --> 00:28:47,550]  For the first question, right now we don't have any plan to issue.\n",
            "[00:28:47,550 --> 00:28:52,550]  We have more than sufficient banking facilities available.\n",
            "[00:28:52,550 --> 00:28:54,930]  Okay.\n",
            "[00:28:54,930 --> 00:28:57,930]  And regarding 5G deployment, as I mentioned,\n",
            "[00:28:57,930 --> 00:29:01,660]  we started the deployment and then, you know,\n",
            "[00:29:02,660 --> 00:29:06,020]  you need to have at least 250 stations.\n",
            "[00:29:06,020 --> 00:29:09,020]  But, of course, we will have more than that.\n",
            "[00:29:09,020 --> 00:29:12,020]  And we are looking at thousands for this year.\n",
            "[00:29:12,020 --> 00:29:15,020]  As to exact numbers for next year,\n",
            "[00:29:15,020 --> 00:29:17,020]  it really has something to do with, you know,\n",
            "[00:29:17,020 --> 00:29:20,020]  how is the market responding, right?\n",
            "[00:29:20,020 --> 00:29:23,020]  So we can adjust, but then, you know,\n",
            "[00:29:23,020 --> 00:29:26,020]  eventually we want to see, you know,\n",
            "[00:29:27,020 --> 00:29:32,020]  our 5G network will cover our entire, you know, 4G network.\n",
            "[00:29:32,020 --> 00:29:37,020]  But then just remember, even before it's completely covering,\n",
            "[00:29:37,020 --> 00:29:42,260]  the way that the network will be used is 4G.\n",
            "[00:29:42,260 --> 00:29:46,060]  So it's never like a 5G alone is not enough.\n",
            "[00:29:46,060 --> 00:29:51,440]  It's on top of already have plenty of spectrum.\n",
            "[00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:55,440]  So to answer your question, we are looking at thousands for this year.\n",
            "[00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:58,440]  And then there will be another few thousands next year.\n",
            "[00:29:58,440 --> 00:30:01,440]  So the exact number really has to depend on the demand\n",
            "[00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:04,980]  and then the competition and all that.\n",
            "[00:30:04,980 --> 00:30:09,300]  So I cannot give you one specific number.\n",
            "[00:30:09,300 --> 00:30:11,300]  It's very helpful. Thanks.\n",
            "[00:30:11,300 --> 00:30:14,300]  And just one follow-up question.\n",
            "[00:30:14,300 --> 00:30:23,300]  We have mentioned the Korean telecom experience.\n",
            "[00:30:23,300 --> 00:30:29,300]  So I'm interested because the Korean telecoms,\n",
            "[00:30:29,300 --> 00:30:32,300]  in the last year, Korean telecoms,\n",
            "[00:30:32,300 --> 00:30:37,300]  when they deployed their 5G network as soon as possible,\n",
            "[00:30:37,300 --> 00:30:45,330]  but as I know, at the second half of 2019,\n",
            "[00:30:45,330 --> 00:30:57,660]  they just stopped their goal to expand their 5G network\n",
            "[00:30:57,660 --> 00:31:01,660]  and the 5G base station deployment\n",
            "[00:31:01,660 --> 00:31:10,210]  because they're concerned that Apple cannot grow as fast as they expected.\n",
            "[00:31:11,210 --> 00:31:23,780]  Will this kind of scenario also happen in Taiwan in this year or not?\n",
            "[00:31:23,780 --> 00:31:25,900]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:31:25,900 --> 00:31:30,900]  Okay. Well, if the COVID-19 did not happen,\n",
            "[00:31:30,900 --> 00:31:34,900]  I would say to compare with Koreans because they were ahead,\n",
            "[00:31:34,900 --> 00:31:40,980]  a full year ahead of launching the 5G service.\n",
            "[00:31:40,980 --> 00:31:44,980]  So we were looking at them as one of the early starter\n",
            "[00:31:44,980 --> 00:31:46,980]  and see how they were doing.\n",
            "[00:31:46,980 --> 00:31:49,980]  And then also, just like when 4G started\n",
            "[00:31:49,980 --> 00:31:54,980]  and Taiwan was behind the rest of the world in adopting 4G.\n",
            "[00:31:54,980 --> 00:31:57,980]  And then we actually had an advantage after your launch\n",
            "[00:31:57,980 --> 00:32:00,980]  and then adoption rate is pretty good.\n",
            "[00:32:00,980 --> 00:32:03,980]  So we already anticipated because 5G,\n",
            "[00:32:03,980 --> 00:32:07,980]  we still consider as one of the early ones to deploy.\n",
            "[00:32:07,980 --> 00:32:08,980]  Taiwan, I mean.\n",
            "[00:32:08,980 --> 00:32:12,980]  So in that case, there may be a risk of being early\n",
            "[00:32:12,980 --> 00:32:19,980]  and then the new applications that may be attractive to the consumers\n",
            "[00:32:19,980 --> 00:32:20,980]  may not be that many.\n",
            "[00:32:20,980 --> 00:32:22,980]  And then that will be the case.\n",
            "[00:32:22,980 --> 00:32:27,980]  And then of course, because of the COVID-19,\n",
            "[00:32:27,980 --> 00:32:29,980]  certainly the entertainment itself\n",
            "[00:32:29,980 --> 00:32:32,980]  is not really number one thing on people's mind.\n",
            "[00:32:32,980 --> 00:32:36,980]  Or maybe after all this, everybody needs some good entertainment.\n",
            "[00:32:36,980 --> 00:32:41,980]  But then one thing I do see is because of this pandemic\n",
            "[00:32:41,980 --> 00:32:44,980]  and then people see the way,\n",
            "[00:32:44,980 --> 00:32:49,980]  the new way of working or communicating is really different.\n",
            "[00:32:49,980 --> 00:32:52,980]  And then so for those that were questioning,\n",
            "[00:32:52,980 --> 00:32:54,980]  why do we need from 4G to 5G?\n",
            "[00:32:54,980 --> 00:32:59,980]  Just the fact that people know now the digital transformation,\n",
            "[00:32:59,980 --> 00:33:02,980]  the need for that, for a company to go digital\n",
            "[00:33:02,980 --> 00:33:04,980]  in order to really take advantage\n",
            "[00:33:04,980 --> 00:33:08,980]  of the telecommunication kind of technology.\n",
            "[00:33:08,980 --> 00:33:09,980]  They understand it.\n",
            "[00:33:09,980 --> 00:33:12,980]  So Bill Gates actually put it himself\n",
            "[00:33:12,980 --> 00:33:14,980]  that because of this COVID-19\n",
            "[00:33:14,980 --> 00:33:17,980]  and then it would accelerate the digital transformation\n",
            "[00:33:17,980 --> 00:33:18,980]  by like 10 years.\n",
            "[00:33:18,980 --> 00:33:21,980]  This was his words, word by word.\n",
            "[00:33:21,980 --> 00:33:23,980]  And then so we do see that.\n",
            "[00:33:23,980 --> 00:33:25,980]  And then as I have been saying,\n",
            "[00:33:25,980 --> 00:33:29,980]  Far East Zone is not only doing the consumer business.\n",
            "[00:33:29,980 --> 00:33:31,980]  We also serve the enterprise as well.\n",
            "[00:33:31,980 --> 00:33:34,980]  So that's why you see a lot of our new economy growth\n",
            "[00:33:34,980 --> 00:33:37,980]  came from our enterprise side.\n",
            "[00:33:37,980 --> 00:33:39,980]  And then so we do see that demand.\n",
            "[00:33:39,980 --> 00:33:45,980]  And we even have a company that they were suffering from the COVID-19.\n",
            "[00:33:45,980 --> 00:33:47,980]  They have to put people on furlough.\n",
            "[00:33:47,980 --> 00:33:50,980]  But then they still, they ask us now,\n",
            "[00:33:50,980 --> 00:33:53,980]  can we help them with some automation or with AI,\n",
            "[00:33:53,980 --> 00:33:56,980]  with some smart manufacturing, things like that.\n",
            "[00:33:56,980 --> 00:33:59,980]  So you see enterprises responding to this differently.\n",
            "[00:33:59,980 --> 00:34:02,980]  So I see, they definitely see the need\n",
            "[00:34:02,980 --> 00:34:06,980]  for more advanced technology in terms of the communications.\n",
            "[00:34:06,980 --> 00:34:08,980]  And that's the business we are in.\n",
            "[00:34:08,980 --> 00:34:11,980]  Now on the other hand, for the consumer,\n",
            "[00:34:11,980 --> 00:34:15,980]  even for myself because my husband is in the States\n",
            "[00:34:15,980 --> 00:34:17,980]  and my two daughters are in the States.\n",
            "[00:34:17,980 --> 00:34:20,980]  Four of us are in four different places.\n",
            "[00:34:20,980 --> 00:34:23,980]  And when we use the line that's over the top\n",
            "[00:34:23,980 --> 00:34:25,980]  and then like we were doing the, you know,\n",
            "[00:34:25,980 --> 00:34:27,980]  what do you call it, video chat.\n",
            "[00:34:27,980 --> 00:34:31,980]  And then we were seeing the happy birthday together for my husband.\n",
            "[00:34:31,980 --> 00:34:33,980]  And then we were like out of sync.\n",
            "[00:34:33,980 --> 00:34:35,980]  And then I would say, okay, let's do it together.\n",
            "[00:34:35,980 --> 00:34:37,980]  And then it took me a second.\n",
            "[00:34:37,980 --> 00:34:38,980]  I said, this is the delay.\n",
            "[00:34:38,980 --> 00:34:41,980]  This is what you're talking about, 4G to 5G.\n",
            "[00:34:41,980 --> 00:34:43,980]  Then you won't have this problem.\n",
            "[00:34:43,980 --> 00:34:45,980]  So even on the consumer, you know,\n",
            "[00:34:45,980 --> 00:34:48,980]  this technology will really bring you together\n",
            "[00:34:48,980 --> 00:34:51,980]  and zero out the physical distance for you, right.\n",
            "[00:34:51,980 --> 00:34:56,980]  So and then I hope and I think that is the case too.\n",
            "[00:34:56,980 --> 00:34:58,980]  More people, because of this situation,\n",
            "[00:34:58,980 --> 00:35:03,980]  understand the importance of the telecommunications technology.\n",

            "[00:35:29,980 --> 00:35:31,980]  I think that kind of brightens the light for them,\n",
            "[00:35:31,980 --> 00:35:33,980]  lit a light for them.\n",

            "[00:36:32,820 --> 00:36:37,820]  if they are not interested in 5G early 3rd plans at the moment yet?\n",
            "[00:36:37,820 --> 00:36:39,820]  That's my first question.\n",
            "[00:36:39,820 --> 00:36:45,820]  And the second question is about the operating cost guidance.\n",
            "[00:36:45,820 --> 00:36:49,820]  I noticed that in the beginning of the year,\n",
            "[00:36:49,820 --> 00:36:54,820]  you are expecting operating costs to go up because of the 5G launch.\n",
            "[00:36:54,820 --> 00:37:00,820]  Would the COVID-19 change your operating cost assumption in any way?\n",
            "[00:37:00,820 --> 00:37:05,820]  For example, are you going to cut more costs in response to it?\n",
            "[00:37:05,820 --> 00:37:12,820]  And the third question is about the enterprise demand\n",
            "[00:37:12,820 --> 00:37:16,820]  that you talked about driven by the COVID-19.\n",

            "[00:37:32,820 --> 00:37:36,820]  I just want to get an understanding of how this is going to drive\n",
            "[00:37:36,820 --> 00:37:41,860]  the overall revenue in the mid-term or long-term.\n",
            "[00:37:41,860 --> 00:37:44,860]  And the last question is about,\n",
            "[00:37:44,860 --> 00:37:49,860]  in regards to the slide that you talked about,\n",
            "[00:37:49,860 --> 00:37:55,020]  you said you have got a new tech company on board\n",

            "[00:38:09,020 --> 00:38:12,020]  or some kind of basic overview would be helpful.\n",

            "[00:38:13,020 --> 00:38:18,060]  Okay, so thank you.\n",
            "[00:38:18,060 --> 00:38:22,060]  For the first question about rolling up the 499 customers,\n",
            "[00:38:22,060 --> 00:38:26,060]  offering or encouraging them to sign up for 5G,\n",
            "[00:38:26,060 --> 00:38:29,060]  of course, is just one of the options.\n",
            "[00:38:29,060 --> 00:38:34,060]  And then, you know, for those that would like to stay on,\n",
            "[00:38:34,060 --> 00:38:37,060]  and then I think we do honor the 499\n",
            "[00:38:37,060 --> 00:38:42,060]  and we give them the option of a continue with that.\n",
            "[00:38:42,060 --> 00:38:45,060]  I can double-check with my marketing officer on that,\n",
            "[00:38:45,060 --> 00:38:48,060]  but then I think that definitely is one of the options.\n",
            "[00:38:49,060 --> 00:38:52,060]  Right, and then in terms of the number two\n",
            "[00:38:52,060 --> 00:38:54,060]  on operating cost guidelines,\n",
            "[00:38:54,060 --> 00:38:57,060]  is it affected by the COVID-19?\n",
            "[00:38:57,060 --> 00:39:00,060]  I would say yes, more or less, you know, a little bit,\n",
            "[00:39:00,060 --> 00:39:03,060]  because in terms of our campaign or, you know,\n",
            "[00:39:03,060 --> 00:39:08,060]  strategy on 5G, this is different time now, right?\n",
            "[00:39:08,060 --> 00:39:12,060]  So this is not, you know, like when we didn't have this,\n",
            "[00:39:12,060 --> 00:39:15,060]  we probably would have big bang kind of events.\n",
            "[00:39:15,060 --> 00:39:18,060]  But then, hey, people are being affected,\n",
            "[00:39:18,060 --> 00:39:22,060]  and then so, you know, this 5G may not be\n",
            "[00:39:22,060 --> 00:39:24,060]  the most important thing on their mind.\n",
            "[00:39:24,060 --> 00:39:26,060]  So we will be more subtle in terms\n",
            "[00:39:26,060 --> 00:39:28,060]  of introducing our new service.\n",
            "[00:39:28,060 --> 00:39:31,060]  So then that will affect how we will do the campaign\n",
            "[00:39:31,060 --> 00:39:33,060]  and all that, and then that will probably\n",
            "[00:39:33,060 --> 00:39:35,060]  help us save some costs.\n",
            "[00:39:35,060 --> 00:39:39,060]  So I think in that regard, it does affect a little bit,\n",
            "[00:39:39,060 --> 00:39:42,060]  and then certainly not to spend more money, that's for sure.\n",
            "[00:39:42,060 --> 00:39:44,220]  Okay, if that answers your question.\n",
            "[00:39:45,220 --> 00:39:48,220]  And your third one is about the enterprise demand\n",
            "[00:39:48,220 --> 00:39:51,220]  that I mentioned about we saw some uplift there\n",
            "[00:39:51,220 --> 00:39:53,220]  or more demands uplift.\n",
            "[00:39:53,220 --> 00:39:56,220]  I don't have exact numbers that I could give you,\n",
            "[00:39:56,220 --> 00:39:59,220]  but then given that it's more drawing on\n",
            "[00:39:59,220 --> 00:40:05,220]  the traditional telecom kind of communication, the facility,\n",
            "[00:40:05,220 --> 00:40:09,220]  so I would say that that will fall under our higher margin,\n",
            "[00:40:09,220 --> 00:40:13,220]  you know, because, you know, that tech on our network,\n",
            "[00:40:13,220 --> 00:40:15,220]  the asset that we already have.\n",
            "[00:40:15,220 --> 00:40:19,220]  So I would say the margin would be reasonable,\n",
            "[00:40:19,220 --> 00:40:22,220]  like a 30% if not more.\n",
            "[00:40:22,220 --> 00:40:24,220]  But then, of course, it depends, right?\n",
            "[00:40:24,220 --> 00:40:27,220]  Every company may have different needs,\n",
            "[00:40:27,220 --> 00:40:30,220]  and on top of it, we may need to add some other,\n",
            "[00:40:30,220 --> 00:40:33,220]  you know, integrated solution or application,\n",
            "[00:40:33,220 --> 00:40:35,220]  but that all varies.\n",
            "[00:40:35,220 --> 00:40:38,220]  But then the bottom line for the communication piece,\n",
            "[00:40:38,220 --> 00:40:40,220]  that is draw upon our core business,\n",
            "[00:40:40,220 --> 00:40:44,220]  so the telecom part, the margin would be higher.\n",
            "[00:40:44,220 --> 00:40:46,220]  And then for your number four,\n",
            "[00:40:46,220 --> 00:40:50,220]  the one that I mentioned that is our first 5G,\n",
            "[00:40:50,220 --> 00:40:56,220]  it is a private network that we have built for this client\n",
            "[00:40:56,220 --> 00:41:00,220]  with a dedicated range for them,\n",
            "[00:41:00,220 --> 00:41:03,220]  and then we set up the infrastructure for them\n",
            "[00:41:03,220 --> 00:41:06,220]  on-site, on-premise.\n",
            "[00:41:06,220 --> 00:41:11,620]  And in terms of the contract value,\n",
            "[00:41:11,620 --> 00:41:13,620]  I would like not to disclose it,\n",
            "[00:41:13,620 --> 00:41:18,620]  but then we are pleased with, because it is our first,\n",
            "[00:41:18,620 --> 00:41:20,620]  and because we were ahead, right?\n",
            "[00:41:20,620 --> 00:41:23,620]  And then we were preparing ourselves, you know,\n",
            "[00:41:23,620 --> 00:41:26,620]  for this, you know, what can we offer the industry\n",
            "[00:41:26,620 --> 00:41:29,620]  when they see they have the need for private network,\n",
            "[00:41:29,620 --> 00:41:32,620]  but then without necessarily getting a dedicated spectrum\n",
            "[00:41:32,620 --> 00:41:33,620]  to their own.\n",
            "[00:41:33,620 --> 00:41:36,620]  So we offer four models, and then we went out\n",
            "[00:41:36,620 --> 00:41:38,620]  and then contact these hero customers\n",
            "[00:41:38,620 --> 00:41:40,620]  in different verticals.\n",
            "[00:41:40,620 --> 00:41:44,620]  So we responded with many interests,\n",
            "[00:41:44,620 --> 00:41:46,620]  and that's why we had quite a few POCs.\n",
            "[00:41:46,620 --> 00:41:49,620]  And this is the first one that we converted a POC\n",
            "[00:41:49,620 --> 00:41:52,620]  to a real contract, which we are pleased with.\n",
            "[00:41:52,620 --> 00:42:00,700]  There will be more to come.\n",
            "[00:42:00,700 --> 00:42:01,700]  Okay.\n",
            "[00:42:01,700 --> 00:42:02,700]  Is that good enough?\n",
            "[00:42:02,700 --> 00:42:03,700]  Okay.\n",
            "[00:42:03,700 --> 00:42:04,700]  All right.\n",
            "[00:42:04,700 --> 00:42:10,720]  Yeah.\n",
            "[00:42:10,720 --> 00:42:12,720]  And the next question is coming from Sarah Warren\n",
            "[00:42:12,720 --> 00:42:13,720]  of Morgan Stanley.\n",
            "[00:42:13,720 --> 00:42:16,520]  Go ahead, please.\n",
            "[00:42:16,520 --> 00:42:17,520]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:19,520]  Thank you, management, for the opportunity to ask questions.\n",
            "[00:42:19,520 --> 00:42:23,520]  So I just have one question on the new economy business.\n",
            "[00:42:23,520 --> 00:42:28,520]  So do we have any goal on this business segment,\n",
            "[00:42:28,520 --> 00:42:31,520]  say, the current really high growth rate?\n",
            "[00:42:31,520 --> 00:42:33,520]  Do you think this is sustainable,\n",
            "[00:42:33,520 --> 00:42:35,520]  or do we have a target, say,\n",
            "[00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:37,520]  what percentage of revenue contribution\n",
            "[00:42:37,520 --> 00:42:40,520]  will this segment be going forward?\n",
            "[00:42:40,520 --> 00:42:43,520]  Or is there any data point that you may share\n",
            "[00:42:44,520 --> 00:42:47,520]  how much of the new economy contributes\n",
            "[00:42:47,520 --> 00:42:49,680]  to our total revenue now?\n",
            "[00:42:49,680 --> 00:42:50,680]  Thanks.\n",
            "[00:42:50,680 --> 00:42:51,680]  Okay.\n",
            "[00:42:51,680 --> 00:42:57,680]  For the first quarter, I think it accounts for about 14.7%.\n",
            "[00:42:57,680 --> 00:43:01,610]  And then we do have a target for the new economy.\n",
            "[00:43:01,610 --> 00:43:05,610]  We are looking at 15% of our total revenue this year.\n",
            "[00:43:05,610 --> 00:43:16,690]  And then so for first quarter, 14.7%.\n",
            "[00:43:16,690 --> 00:43:17,690]  Got it.\n",
            "[00:43:17,690 --> 00:43:18,690]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:43:18,690 --> 00:43:21,040]  And just one follow-up question.\n",
            "[00:43:21,040 --> 00:43:24,040]  So I believe all this new economy revenue\n",
            "[00:43:24,040 --> 00:43:27,040]  will be included under the enterprise business\n",
            "[00:43:27,040 --> 00:43:30,040]  or enterprise revenue we just discussed about.\n",
            "[00:43:30,040 --> 00:43:34,040]  So would you please also share maybe what percentage of revenue\n",
            "[00:43:34,040 --> 00:43:37,140]  does the enterprise business contribute?\n",
            "[00:43:37,140 --> 00:43:38,140]  Okay.\n",
            "[00:43:38,140 --> 00:43:42,140]  So first of all, the new economy actually consists of the enterprise,\n",
            "[00:43:42,140 --> 00:43:46,140]  you know, those like IOT, you know, ICT,\n",
            "[00:43:46,140 --> 00:43:48,140]  and then private networks and all that.\n",
            "[00:43:48,140 --> 00:43:51,140]  And then we also have, you know, our CIOT\n",
            "[00:43:51,140 --> 00:43:56,140]  and also our e-commerce type of value-added digital services\n",
            "[00:43:56,140 --> 00:43:58,140]  on the consumer side.\n",
            "[00:43:58,140 --> 00:44:01,140]  So it's not all of it is for enterprise.\n",
            "[00:44:01,140 --> 00:44:05,140]  But then to answer your question about our enterprise revenue target,\n",
            "[00:44:05,140 --> 00:44:11,620]  we are looking at 25% this year.\n",
            "[00:44:11,620 --> 00:44:12,620]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:44:12,620 --> 00:44:14,620]  And maybe just one small follow-up.\n",
            "[00:44:14,620 --> 00:44:16,620]  What's the number for first quarter\n",
            "[00:44:16,620 --> 00:44:21,130]  for enterprise revenue contribution?\n",
            "[00:44:21,130 --> 00:44:23,130]  Okay, let's do a quick recalculation.\n",
            "[00:44:23,130 --> 00:44:29,100]  I didn't do that.\n",
            "[00:44:29,100 --> 00:44:31,100]  I believe it should exceed it\n",
            "[00:44:31,100 --> 00:44:36,100]  because our enterprise really did very well first quarter.\n",
            "[00:44:36,100 --> 00:44:40,100]  They overachieved across all financial indicators,\n",
            "[00:44:40,100 --> 00:44:44,100]  the revenue, the EBITDA, the net income.\n",
            "[00:44:44,100 --> 00:45:01,630]  No, she was asking that we cannot keep up.\n",
            "[00:45:03,880 --> 00:45:33,290]  Hi, Sarah.\n",
            "[00:45:33,290 --> 00:45:38,560]  We probably gave you this number of mine.\n",
            "[00:45:38,560 --> 00:45:43,860]  Give you a more accurate number.\n",
            "[00:45:43,860 --> 00:45:45,280]  Okay.\n",
            "[00:45:45,280 --> 00:45:51,500]  Thank you very much.\n",

            "[00:00:36,030 --> 00:00:45,510]  Good afternoon everyone. Thank you for participating in FET's 4th Quarter 2019 Results Conference Call.\n",
            "[00:00:45,510 --> 00:00:50,510]  Today our President Chi and CFO Sherman both joined the call with us.\n",

            "[00:01:19,630 --> 00:01:26,630]  In terms of the mobile market in Taiwan, we are glad to report that in terms of the subscribers,\n",

            "[00:01:29,630 --> 00:01:33,630]  Firestone has continued to grow in our post-pay numbers.\n",
            "[00:01:33,630 --> 00:01:39,630]  As a matter of fact, since 2014, our post-pay subscribers have been declining slightly.\n",

            "[00:01:42,630 --> 00:01:45,630]  This is the first time we are going up again.\n",
            "[00:01:45,630 --> 00:01:52,630]  For five quarters in a row, our post-pay customers have been growing, which is great news.\n",
            "[00:01:52,630 --> 00:02:04,630]  On the other hand, in terms of the mobile number portability, MNP, the market has cooled down, which is good.\n",
            "[00:02:04,630 --> 00:02:10,630]  In terms of our post-pay churn, we kept hitting the record low.\n",
            "[00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:16,630]  Actually, just last month, the January number, I would like to share that with you here as well.\n",
            "[00:02:16,630 --> 00:02:20,630]  It is now 1.26%.\n",
            "[00:02:20,630 --> 00:02:27,630]  That also helps our market to stabilize and also the competition to cool down a little bit.\n",
            "[00:02:28,630 --> 00:02:35,630]  In terms of the operational performance, we are glad that we are leading our peers in terms of our R-pool,\n",
            "[00:02:35,630 --> 00:02:41,630]  in both the post-paid R-pool and also the blended R-pool, especially for the post-paid.\n",
            "[00:02:41,630 --> 00:02:46,630]  The lead is a lot more obvious than the blended.\n",
            "[00:02:46,630 --> 00:02:51,630]  In terms of our customer satisfaction, according to the third-party survey,\n",
            "[00:02:52,630 --> 00:02:55,630]  our customer satisfaction has continued to go up.\n",
            "[00:02:55,630 --> 00:03:03,630]  We will continue to do better and work better with our network and continue to optimize our network performance\n",
            "[00:03:03,630 --> 00:03:08,300]  and optimize our users' experience.\n",
            "[00:03:08,300 --> 00:03:15,300]  As you know, we have been focusing on our new economy as we want to grow out of the traditional telecom\n",
            "[00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:18,300]  and to grow into a telecom plus.\n",
            "[00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:25,300]  The transformation relies a lot on how we are doing in our new economy area.\n",
            "[00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:31,300]  For five years in a row, if you look at the growth in the new economy area,\n",
            "[00:03:31,300 --> 00:03:39,300]  last year we achieved about 13% and then we are looking to expand to about 15% this year.\n",
            "[00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:45,300]  Of course, the denominator is not a fixed number,\n",
            "[00:03:45,300 --> 00:03:50,300]  so it could fluctuate a little bit depending on how we are doing in the other business.\n",
            "[00:03:50,300 --> 00:03:58,300]  We use this not necessarily as a KPI, just directionally, and then we will continue to grow this.\n",
            "[00:03:58,300 --> 00:04:02,300]  Especially on the right-hand side, if you see, we give several examples,\n",
            "[00:04:02,300 --> 00:04:05,300]  but they are more in the enterprise area.\n",
            "[00:04:05,300 --> 00:04:12,300]  Our cloud service has grown more than 4.5 times than the year before.\n",
            "[00:04:12,300 --> 00:04:20,300]  Our IoT business is also doing very well and it is almost 3.5 times more than the year before.\n",
            "[00:04:20,300 --> 00:04:28,300]  In terms of the security and also the system integration, the SI, the typical ICT kind of project,\n",
            "[00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:31,300]  they are also in double digits growth.\n",
            "[00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:37,300]  We are very pleased, especially in the enterprise area, how our new economy has been blooming.\n",
            "[00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:48,640]  In terms of our bottom line, we have exceeded our board target or our guidance by 3%.\n",
            "[00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:56,640]  In terms of the guidance achievement, we are happy with how we were doing last year.\n",
            "[00:04:56,640 --> 00:05:01,640]  With that, I will pass it on to Sherman for our financial performance details.\n",
            "[00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:03,640]  Thank you, Chief.\n",

            "[00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:20,640]  It has been stabilized from the year beginning 7.47 billion to the fourth quarter 7.09 billion.\n",

            "[00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:39,920]  and the 4G quality network that we have put out there.\n",

            "[00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:30,920]  Even with that, we will see with the 4K and the 8K resolution type of streaming\n",

            "[00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:08,920]  We are looking for, in the third quarter, to have the business launch.\n",
            "[00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:14,920]  This won't be in the third quarter, but it will be in the third quarter.\n",
            "[00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:20,920]  In the consumer BU area, the three priorities we have set for ourselves.\n",
            "[00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:27,920]  One is to develop the 5G content services that will be attractive for the 5G adoption.\n",
            "[00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:30,920]  Of course, some of this we have partners that we work with.\n",
            "[00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:33,920]  We don't need to start from scratch.\n",
            "[00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:36,920]  We also want to expand our loyal customer base\n",
            "[00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:39,920]  and grow the total customer value contribution.\n",
            "[00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:44,920]  Then we want to grow our e-commerce and then mobile financial services\n",
            "[00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:48,920]  and new digital services in these areas.\n",
            "[00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:56,920]  This is continuing our transformation journey to set us beyond the traditional telecom services.\n",
            "[00:17:56,920 --> 00:18:00,920]  We will continue to do better with these new services as well.\n",
            "[00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:07,920]  On the enterprise BU part, we will continue to grow new economy revenue,\n",
            "[00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:11,920]  but then we will also look to improve the EBITDA.\n",
            "[00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:14,920]  Last year, we have done a tremendous job.\n",
            "[00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:19,920]  Our enterprise team really has done a great job.\n",
            "[00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:25,920]  We set very high revenue targets for them, and they were really short by just 0.5%.\n",
            "[00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:29,920]  That was really tremendous efforts on their part, and I was very proud of them.\n",
            "[00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:34,920]  We have established our name in this area now.\n",
            "[00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:40,920]  We will be even more selective when it comes to the margin and when it comes to EBITDA.\n",
            "[00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:45,920]  At the same time, since we established the transformation office,\n",
            "[00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:50,920]  one main purpose of that office is to provide home solutions\n",
            "[00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:56,920]  or added value to the solutions that our enterprise provides to our enterprise customers.\n",
            "[00:18:56,920 --> 00:19:02,920]  We will continue to do that so we can improve our FET added value and margin\n",

            "[00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:11,950]  Then we will upgrade and upsell the telecom business solutions with new technologies.\n",
            "[00:19:11,950 --> 00:19:19,950]  Many of our clients in the telecom area, they are also looking to do some upgrade or more automation.\n",
            "[00:19:19,950 --> 00:19:25,950]  This is where we have been focusing on the big data, AI, and IoT technology\n",
            "[00:19:25,950 --> 00:19:28,950]  and the capabilities we have been building that will come handy.\n",
            "[00:19:28,950 --> 00:19:34,950]  They already are our traditional telecom clients, and now we can help them with more.\n",
            "[00:19:34,950 --> 00:19:40,950]  This is one of the three priorities for our enterprise BU as well.\n",
            "[00:19:40,950 --> 00:19:46,950]  Then we have our omni-channel that supports both enterprise and the consumers.\n",
            "[00:19:46,950 --> 00:19:50,950]  Then for this year, because we are going to launch 5G,\n",
            "[00:19:50,950 --> 00:19:57,950]  we are looking at how to optimize our channel in order to drive higher 5G adoption.\n",
            "[00:19:57,950 --> 00:20:03,950]  Of course, we will continue to develop, retain, and recruit talent.\n",
            "[00:20:03,950 --> 00:20:11,950]  The knowledge is power, and the people are a company's best asset,\n",
            "[00:20:11,950 --> 00:20:15,950]  most valuable asset, so people are important.\n",
            "[00:20:15,950 --> 00:20:21,950]  Then there is competition, so we want to make sure we retain talent as well.\n",
            "[00:20:21,950 --> 00:20:26,950]  Last but not least, we need to control our costs.\n",
            "[00:20:26,950 --> 00:20:35,950]  Sherman did show that we have higher operating costs than we were expecting.\n",
            "[00:20:35,950 --> 00:20:39,950]  However, as the president of the company, and I can tell you that,\n",
            "[00:20:39,950 --> 00:20:44,950]  we will continue to scrub that, so I believe we will do better than what has shown to you.\n",
            "[00:20:44,950 --> 00:20:47,950]  This is one of our top priorities.\n",
            "[00:20:47,950 --> 00:20:52,950]  Across the board, across the company, we will continue to improve our bottom line.\n",
            "[00:20:52,950 --> 00:20:55,110]  We will control our costs.\n",
            "[00:20:55,110 --> 00:20:58,110]  With that, I think that's the last slide I have.\n",
            "[00:20:58,110 --> 00:21:03,220]  Let's start the Q&A session, please.\n",
            "[00:21:03,220 --> 00:21:04,220]  Yes, of course. Thank you.\n",
            "[00:21:04,220 --> 00:21:08,470]  We will now begin our question and answer session.\n",
            "[00:21:08,470 --> 00:21:10,470]  If you have a question for any of today's speakers,\n",
            "[00:21:10,470 --> 00:21:15,470]  please press 01 on your telephone keypad, and you will enter the queue.\n",
            "[00:21:15,470 --> 00:21:18,470]  After you are announced, please ask your question.\n",
            "[00:21:18,470 --> 00:21:22,470]  If you find that your question has been answered before it is your turn to speak,\n",
            "[00:21:22,470 --> 00:21:25,470]  please press 02 to cancel the question.\n",
            "[00:21:25,470 --> 00:21:26,470]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:21:26,470 --> 00:21:34,090]  The first question is coming from Neil Anderson of HSBC.\n",
            "[00:21:34,090 --> 00:21:35,090]  Go ahead, please.\n",
            "[00:21:35,090 --> 00:21:38,080]  Hi there. Good afternoon. Thank you.\n",
            "[00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:40,080]  I have two questions, please.\n",
            "[00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:42,080]  The first one relates to the dividend,\n",
            "[00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:47,080]  and particularly how you think about that going forward\n",
            "[00:21:47,080 --> 00:21:50,080]  and how you make your recommendations to the board.\n",
            "[00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:54,080]  You have cut your recommendation for this year,\n",
            "[00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:57,080]  but still a payout ratio above 100%.\n",
            "[00:21:57,080 --> 00:21:59,080]  Really, my question is,\n",
            "[00:21:59,080 --> 00:22:03,180]  is that how we should think about the Far Eastern Dividend from here?\n",
            "[00:22:03,180 --> 00:22:11,550]  Your aim to pay is closely linked to earnings from now on.\n",
            "[00:22:11,550 --> 00:22:15,710]  Is that how you think we should understand it?\n",
            "[00:22:15,710 --> 00:22:16,870]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:22:18,220 --> 00:22:26,220]  First of all, for 3.25, our payout ratio is 120, not just 100%.\n",
            "[00:22:26,220 --> 00:22:28,220]  It is 121%.\n",
            "[00:22:28,220 --> 00:22:31,220]  It is adjusted down a little bit from last year,\n",
            "[00:22:31,220 --> 00:22:35,220]  and last year it was extremely high, which was 130%.\n",
            "[00:22:35,220 --> 00:22:41,220]  If you look at the history of our payout, it has been over 100%.\n",
            "[00:22:41,220 --> 00:22:44,220]  We maintain a generous payout policy,\n",
            "[00:22:45,220 --> 00:22:47,220]  but then also for this year,\n",
            "[00:22:47,220 --> 00:22:51,220]  I think this is based on what we have at the beginning,\n",
            "[00:22:51,220 --> 00:22:59,220]  the reserved earnings that we do not distribute.\n",
            "[00:22:59,220 --> 00:23:05,220]  We have 2.68, so that adds up to about 3.2 or so.\n",
            "[00:23:05,220 --> 00:23:10,220]  We just figured 3.25 is a reasonable number,\n",
            "[00:23:10,220 --> 00:23:16,220]  and then we adjusted from 130, that was too high last year, to 121%.\n",
            "[00:23:16,220 --> 00:23:21,220]  I think we will continue to maintain a generous payout policy.\n",
            "[00:23:21,220 --> 00:23:25,980]  Understood. Thanks. That is very helpful.\n",
            "[00:23:25,980 --> 00:23:28,980]  The second question is really a clarification.\n",
            "[00:23:28,980 --> 00:23:32,980]  It relates to slide 13, Sherman, which you went through.\n",
            "[00:23:32,980 --> 00:23:36,980]  I am probably being daft, but I am confused by the operating expenses.\n",
            "[00:23:36,980 --> 00:23:39,980]  $14.8 billion to $16.4 billion.\n",
            "[00:23:39,980 --> 00:23:42,980]  What does that refer to exactly?\n",
            "[00:23:42,980 --> 00:23:50,400]  Basically, because of the 5G program,\n",
            "[00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:54,400]  we are increasing our spending on 5G preparation\n",
            "[00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:59,400]  and related subsidies and other things,\n",
            "[00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:03,620]  because we want to have a good start on 5G.\n",
            "[00:24:03,620 --> 00:24:05,620]  Some of the accounting treatments,\n",
            "[00:24:05,620 --> 00:24:08,620]  some of the subsidies we paid last year got deferred.\n",
            "[00:24:08,620 --> 00:24:15,620]  We were very aggressive last year to get more subscribers for the total value,\n",
            "[00:24:15,620 --> 00:24:20,620]  and then as a result, we actually paid quite a bit of subsidy.\n",
            "[00:24:20,620 --> 00:24:22,620]  But then because of the accounting treatment change,\n",
            "[00:24:22,620 --> 00:24:26,620]  some of that actually deferred or reflected in this year.\n",
            "[00:24:26,620 --> 00:24:29,620]  So there is some accumulative kind of effect there.\n",
            "[00:24:29,620 --> 00:24:32,620]  But then on the other hand, because of 5G,\n",
            "[00:24:33,620 --> 00:24:39,620]  we do have more expenses planned because of launching the 5G.\n",
            "[00:24:39,620 --> 00:24:42,620]  So that kind of adds up to the difference.\n",
            "[00:24:42,620 --> 00:24:47,740]  But then we will be able to continue to scrub that.\n",
            "[00:24:47,740 --> 00:24:48,740]  Okay, thank you.\n",
            "[00:24:48,740 --> 00:24:50,740]  So what does the number refer to?\n",
            "[00:24:50,740 --> 00:24:54,740]  Because I have got OPEX before DNA at about $55 billion.\n",
            "[00:24:54,740 --> 00:25:00,120]  So what was the $14.8 billion?\n",
            "[00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:02,120]  What constitutes that?\n",
            "[00:25:04,940 --> 00:25:11,530]  Sorry, give us a second.\n",
            "[00:25:14,620 --> 00:25:18,620]  We will get back to you offline for the detailed numbers, okay?\n",
            "[00:25:18,620 --> 00:25:20,780]  I think, okay.\n",
            "[00:25:20,780 --> 00:25:28,100]  I think it is all based on our financial report.\n",
            "[00:25:28,100 --> 00:25:29,100]  Is that okay, Neil?\n",
            "[00:25:29,100 --> 00:25:32,390]  Yes, sorry, I was being added and removed.\n",
            "[00:25:32,390 --> 00:25:34,390]  So I will catch up with you after the call and clarify.\n",
            "[00:25:34,390 --> 00:25:35,390]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:25:35,390 --> 00:25:36,390]  Sure, sure.\n",
            "[00:25:36,390 --> 00:25:41,200]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:44,200]  And the next question is coming from Peter Milliken of Deutsche Bank.\n",
            "[00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:45,200]  Go ahead, please.\n",
            "[00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:46,420]  Yes, hi.\n",
            "[00:25:46,420 --> 00:25:47,420]  I have two questions.\n",
            "[00:25:47,420 --> 00:25:49,420]  I will ask them one at a time.\n",
            "[00:25:49,420 --> 00:25:51,420]  First of all, just on the DPS.\n",
            "[00:25:51,420 --> 00:25:54,420]  I mean, you guys have been very generous for a long time\n",
            "[00:25:54,420 --> 00:25:56,420]  and you have to be congratulated for that.\n",
            "[00:25:56,420 --> 00:26:00,420]  But it gets to the point where because industry earnings\n",
            "[00:26:00,420 --> 00:26:01,420]  have been coming down so much,\n",
            "[00:26:01,420 --> 00:26:03,420]  you get into this uncomfortable position.\n",
            "[00:26:03,420 --> 00:26:09,580]  Now you have cut your DPS, but at 121%, it is still high.\n",
            "[00:26:09,580 --> 00:26:12,580]  And presumably, you know, you need to start,\n",
            "[00:26:12,580 --> 00:26:16,580]  you need to think about putting money aside for the end of the decade\n",
            "[00:26:16,580 --> 00:26:19,580]  when the next Spectrum auction comes around to fund that.\n",
            "[00:26:19,580 --> 00:26:24,740]  So are you thinking that you are going to grow into your DPS,\n",
            "[00:26:24,740 --> 00:26:31,740]  that just earnings get, say, 20% higher in the coming five years\n",
            "[00:26:31,740 --> 00:26:32,740]  and solve that problem?\n",
            "[00:26:32,740 --> 00:26:35,740]  Or do you think Spectrum is going to get cheaper?\n",
            "[00:26:35,740 --> 00:26:38,740]  Or is there something else that I am maybe misunderstanding?\n",
            "[00:26:38,740 --> 00:26:41,990]  Just to start with that one.\n",
            "[00:26:42,990 --> 00:26:44,020]  Okay.\n",
            "[00:26:44,020 --> 00:26:50,020]  Well, so I think if you look at a history of Far Eastern's payout, right?\n",
            "[00:26:50,020 --> 00:26:56,020]  So since 2011, we have been paying more than 100%.\n",
            "[00:26:56,020 --> 00:26:59,020]  So between, you know, not counting last year's 130,\n",
            "[00:26:59,020 --> 00:27:04,020]  you know, it has been like between 104 to 113.\n",
            "[00:27:04,020 --> 00:27:09,020]  So I think that's a reasonable enough range.\n",
            "[00:27:09,020 --> 00:27:12,020]  And then, like I said, last year it was really, really high.\n",
            "[00:27:12,020 --> 00:27:15,020]  And then, you know, we adjusted down.\n",
            "[00:27:15,020 --> 00:27:18,020]  And then, of course, with our, you know, auction,\n",
            "[00:27:18,020 --> 00:27:22,020]  the most expensive, you know, bidding in history for us.\n",
            "[00:27:22,020 --> 00:27:25,020]  So that definitely is a factor.\n",
            "[00:27:25,020 --> 00:27:30,020]  And then now if you are asking, are we going to continue to be at 120?\n",
            "[00:27:30,020 --> 00:27:35,020]  So I think, you know, from our EPS forecast for next year,\n",
            "[00:27:36,020 --> 00:27:41,380]  and, you know, that is yet to be seen.\n",
            "[00:27:41,380 --> 00:27:42,380]  But I would agree.\n",
            "[00:27:42,380 --> 00:27:47,380]  I think 120, especially if we compare with our peers, that is on the high side.\n",
            "[00:27:47,380 --> 00:27:48,380]  That is on the high side.\n",
            "[00:27:48,380 --> 00:27:53,380]  Now in terms of another Spectrum, you know, coming up,\n",
            "[00:27:53,380 --> 00:27:56,380]  well, that is really still in the air.\n",
            "[00:27:56,380 --> 00:28:02,380]  And then given we have, I think we have a very good position in 5G.\n",
            "[00:28:02,380 --> 00:28:07,380]  Not only we got 3.5, you know, we also have 28G.\n",
            "[00:28:07,380 --> 00:28:11,380]  So for now, I really think we are more than sufficient.\n",
            "[00:28:11,380 --> 00:28:19,380]  So for the other Spectrum planning, I really don't see that too soon.\n",
            "[00:28:19,380 --> 00:28:21,240]  Right. Okay.\n",
            "[00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:25,240]  And then my second question is you talked earlier, you know,\n",
            "[00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:27,240]  you gave a great presentation about what you're doing\n",
            "[00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:29,240]  in sort of new digital initiatives.\n",
            "[00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:30,240]  That was fantastic.\n",
            "[00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:36,460]  One thing you mentioned was consumer demand in 5G for 4K, 8K, VR, cloud gaming,\n",
            "[00:28:36,460 --> 00:28:38,460]  and I agree with that.\n",
            "[00:28:38,460 --> 00:28:44,620]  My question is can you monetize that extra data throughput\n",
            "[00:28:44,620 --> 00:28:47,620]  given the existing pricing plans?\n",
            "[00:28:47,620 --> 00:28:56,480]  So for the existing pricing that you're referring to 4G,\n",
            "[00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:59,480]  so for 5G, there will be different pricing plans.\n",
            "[00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:00,480]  That's for sure.\n",
            "[00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:06,480]  And I think everybody knows, right, Taiwan has one of the cheapest,\n",
            "[00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:14,480]  if not the cheapest, you know, 4G ARPU or plan that's available worldwide.\n",
            "[00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:19,480]  So, you know, that was due to the 499 a year ago, right?\n",
            "[00:29:19,480 --> 00:29:25,480]  So and then with the price that carriers paid the government\n",
            "[00:29:25,480 --> 00:29:28,480]  for acquiring the 5G Spectrum,\n",
            "[00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:34,480]  I think the public should expect the price should go up,\n",
            "[00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:38,480]  even at a reasonable bidding price if that's what we paid, you know,\n",
            "[00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:45,480]  with what 5G could provide if the users sign on to the 5G program\n",
            "[00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:47,480]  and then the higher price should be expected\n",
            "[00:29:47,480 --> 00:29:52,220]  and then that is also our expectation as well.\n",
            "[00:29:52,220 --> 00:29:57,220]  So I do plan on monetize, but then the question is always to what extent\n",
            "[00:29:57,220 --> 00:29:59,220]  and also what our competitors will do.\n",
            "[00:29:59,220 --> 00:30:06,220]  And we do know that we have one of the leading companies, right,\n",
            "[00:30:06,220 --> 00:30:11,220]  they are not exactly like a, you know, privately owned.\n",
            "[00:30:11,220 --> 00:30:13,220]  So they could have a little bit different agenda\n",
            "[00:30:13,220 --> 00:30:15,220]  or different pricing, you know, strategy.\n",
            "[00:30:15,220 --> 00:30:19,220]  And then to be honest, they are the market setter.\n",
            "[00:30:19,220 --> 00:30:23,220]  So, you know, how the market price would go\n",
            "[00:30:23,220 --> 00:30:26,220]  would have a lot to do with what they will do.\n",
            "[00:30:26,220 --> 00:30:29,220]  And then hopefully if everybody is in their right sense, right,\n",
            "[00:30:29,220 --> 00:30:32,220]  I think, you know, it's just like the government said,\n",
            "[00:30:32,220 --> 00:30:35,220]  when they wouldn't interfere with the bidding,\n",
            "[00:30:35,220 --> 00:30:39,220]  they said they were respecting the market, you know, mechanism.\n",
            "[00:30:39,220 --> 00:30:41,220]  And then when it comes to the price setting,\n",
            "[00:30:41,220 --> 00:30:44,220]  it should also be respected as well.\n",
            "[00:30:44,220 --> 00:30:48,220]  It doesn't make any sense to, you know, to let the cost go up, right,\n",
            "[00:30:48,220 --> 00:30:50,220]  and then without any interference.\n",
            "[00:30:50,220 --> 00:30:52,220]  But on the other hand, you've got a cap on your price.\n",
            "[00:30:52,220 --> 00:30:56,220]  That wouldn't be a fair market competition at all.\n",
            "[00:30:56,220 --> 00:30:59,220]  But then that is something beyond my control.\n",
            "[00:30:59,220 --> 00:31:03,220]  But then if you ask me from Far East Zone's perspective,\n",
            "[00:31:03,220 --> 00:31:07,250]  I do expect the 5G price to be higher than 4G.\n",
            "[00:31:07,250 --> 00:31:10,250]  And anybody in their right mind should expect that.\n",
            "[00:31:10,250 --> 00:31:14,240]  Yeah, and this is a great point about, you know,\n",
            "[00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:19,240]  whether the government controls, you know, one price and not the other.\n",
            "[00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:22,240]  Because with the 4G spectrum,\n",
            "[00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:25,240]  they were holding you back on 3G pricing,\n",
            "[00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:30,240]  basically mandating that unlimited pricing had to be maintained.\n",
            "[00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:35,340]  Are you hearing that for 4G pricing in the lead up to the 5G rollout,\n",
            "[00:31:35,340 --> 00:31:38,340]  or that has not been a subject discussed yet?\n",
            "[00:31:38,340 --> 00:31:40,880]  We haven't heard anything like that.\n",
            "[00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:42,880]  But then I think on the contrary, right,\n",
            "[00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:45,880]  because I talked about the excessive bidding price.\n",
            "[00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:49,880]  So, you know, I think the government is considering\n",
            "[00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:52,880]  how they could, you know, compensate us for that.\n",
            "[00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:56,880]  And then, you know, in terms of some credit or, you know,\n",
            "[00:31:56,880 --> 00:31:59,880]  tax break, you know, things like that.\n",
            "[00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:02,880]  So if that does happen, and I hope that will happen,\n",
            "[00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:05,880]  and then we should all get some relief.\n",
            "[00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:10,880]  For those of us that paid a lot, we should get some relief.\n",
            "[00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:12,980]  I hope so. Thank you very much.\n",
            "[00:32:12,980 --> 00:32:13,980]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:32:13,980 --> 00:32:20,850]  And next we're having Danny Chiu of Bank of America.\n",
            "[00:32:20,850 --> 00:32:21,850]  Go ahead, please.\n",
            "[00:32:21,850 --> 00:32:25,260]  Hi. Thank you for the presentation.\n",
            "[00:32:25,260 --> 00:32:27,260]  Two quick questions.\n",
            "[00:32:27,260 --> 00:32:29,260]  First, in your presentation,\n",
            "[00:32:29,260 --> 00:32:34,260]  you mentioned that the 5G as well as the enterprise application.\n",
            "[00:32:34,260 --> 00:32:39,260]  So far, based on your discussion with all the business partners,\n",
            "[00:32:39,260 --> 00:32:42,260]  even though I understand probably the 5G revenue from enterprise\n",
            "[00:32:42,260 --> 00:32:45,260]  is going to be immaterial this year,\n",
            "[00:32:45,260 --> 00:32:49,260]  but if you have to name one or two specific examples,\n",
            "[00:32:49,260 --> 00:32:53,260]  which are the specific applications for the enterprise customer\n",
            "[00:32:53,260 --> 00:32:57,260]  that you think will carry the biggest revenue potential going forward?\n",
            "[00:32:57,260 --> 00:32:59,260]  That's question number one.\n",
            "[00:32:59,260 --> 00:33:04,260]  And question number two is also kind of on the back of the comments\n",
            "[00:33:04,260 --> 00:33:07,260]  that you just made on the 5G tariffs,\n",
            "[00:33:07,260 --> 00:33:11,260]  that you expect 5G tariffs to be higher than 4G tariffs\n",
            "[00:33:11,260 --> 00:33:14,260]  given the price you pay for the spectrum.\n",
            "[00:33:15,260 --> 00:33:20,260]  But do you think in case if the major, major operator\n",
            "[00:33:20,260 --> 00:33:28,260]  set the 5G tariffs at a level simply just to drive up 5G adoption rate,\n",
            "[00:33:28,260 --> 00:33:30,260]  should we expect 5G simply to match it\n",
            "[00:33:30,260 --> 00:33:34,260]  just because we also want to kind of get the customer\n",
            "[00:33:34,260 --> 00:33:36,260]  regardless of the tariff level?\n",
            "[00:33:36,260 --> 00:33:37,260]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:33:37,260 --> 00:33:43,800]  Danny, sorry.\n",
            "[00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:47,800]  We didn't hear your second question very clearly.\n",
            "[00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:50,800]  But we could answer your first question first.\n",
            "[00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:52,800]  How about that?\n",
            "[00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:55,800]  So you're asking about the type of applications\n",
            "[00:33:55,800 --> 00:33:58,800]  that we could use in enterprise, right?\n",
            "[00:33:58,800 --> 00:34:01,800]  So for, you know, it's really more like a private network,\n",
            "[00:34:01,800 --> 00:34:04,800]  like a dedicated network to a site.\n",
            "[00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:09,800]  And then this is actually in the manufacturing area.\n",
            "[00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:11,800]  That is quite useful.\n",
            "[00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:16,800]  And like I mentioned, we already have a signed a contract, right,\n",
            "[00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:17,800]  with Media Tech.\n",
            "[00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:23,800]  But then it's really more for his, I would say his suppliers\n",
            "[00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:29,820]  or his downstream, right?\n",
            "[00:34:29,820 --> 00:34:32,820]  Yeah, his testing partners, right,\n",
            "[00:34:32,820 --> 00:34:34,820]  the packaging and testing partners\n",
            "[00:34:34,820 --> 00:34:38,820]  where they need to, you know, communicate the data back and forth\n",
            "[00:34:38,820 --> 00:34:39,820]  and all that.\n",
            "[00:34:39,820 --> 00:34:41,820]  And then they need to have very reliable\n",
            "[00:34:41,820 --> 00:34:43,820]  and low latency kind of communication.\n",
            "[00:34:44,820 --> 00:34:48,820]  And then we, you know, this is like one size doesn't fit all.\n",
            "[00:34:48,820 --> 00:34:53,820]  So every such scenario, our technical team actually need to work\n",
            "[00:34:53,820 --> 00:34:57,820]  with the business customers and see what their needs are.\n",
            "[00:34:57,820 --> 00:35:00,820]  And then right away we mentioned there were four models, right?\n",
            "[00:35:00,820 --> 00:35:01,820]  And then so which one,\n",
            "[00:35:01,820 --> 00:35:05,820]  and maybe a combination of two that will suit them.\n",
            "[00:35:05,820 --> 00:35:11,820]  But then right now we have like double digits POCs going on.\n",
            "[00:35:11,820 --> 00:35:13,820]  And then we already have the first one that's signed.\n",
            "[00:35:13,820 --> 00:35:15,820]  And then so we expect more.\n",
            "[00:35:15,820 --> 00:35:19,820]  So definitely there are many useful scenarios,\n",
            "[00:35:19,820 --> 00:35:21,820]  especially in the manufacturing area.\n",
            "[00:35:21,820 --> 00:35:25,850]  And don't forget we have a 5 cent group to support.\n",
            "[00:35:25,850 --> 00:35:28,880]  We work with them with many cases as well.\n",
            "[00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:32,880]  Yeah, the POCs don't even count our own group, yeah.\n",
            "[00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:38,190]  So these are all external companies.\n",
            "[00:35:38,190 --> 00:35:41,190]  Okay, and then if you would repeat your second question.\n",
            "[00:35:41,190 --> 00:35:42,190]  I got distracted.\n",
            "[00:35:42,190 --> 00:35:45,190]  And then I think I called the end of it,\n",
            "[00:35:45,190 --> 00:35:48,190]  but if you would just abbreviate it for me again,\n",
            "[00:35:48,190 --> 00:35:49,190]  then I would appreciate it.\n",
            "[00:35:49,190 --> 00:35:50,190]  I'll try to answer.\n",
            "[00:35:50,190 --> 00:35:51,290]  Yeah, sure.\n",
            "[00:35:51,290 --> 00:35:55,290]  Actually, just a follow-up to the comments that you just made.\n",
            "[00:35:55,290 --> 00:35:58,290]  On the contract that you signed with MediaTek,\n",
            "[00:35:58,290 --> 00:36:02,290]  could you share with us how do you charge MediaTek?\n",
            "[00:36:02,290 --> 00:36:04,290]  Is it a lump sum contract?\n",
            "[00:36:04,290 --> 00:36:08,290]  No, I think you should know better than that.\n",
            "[00:36:08,290 --> 00:36:11,290]  That is really not something for me to share.\n",
            "[00:36:11,290 --> 00:36:15,290]  And I already mentioned a client, so I think that's all.\n",
            "[00:36:15,290 --> 00:36:16,380]  Okay.\n",
            "[00:36:16,380 --> 00:36:20,380]  But back to the follow-up question that I was asking is,\n",
            "[00:36:20,380 --> 00:36:26,380]  in case if the major operator set the 5G tariffs at a level\n",
            "[00:36:26,380 --> 00:36:29,380]  simply just to drive up the adoption rate,\n",
            "[00:36:29,380 --> 00:36:34,380]  even though you mentioned earlier that you would want 5G tariffs\n",
            "[00:36:34,380 --> 00:36:39,380]  to be higher than 4G tariffs because of the price you pay for the spectrum,\n",
            "[00:36:39,380 --> 00:36:45,540]  are we going to just match whatever the tariff set by the major operator\n",
            "[00:36:45,540 --> 00:36:50,150]  simply just to compete for market share?\n",
            "[00:36:50,150 --> 00:36:54,150]  Well, I think it's really, when it comes to pricing and all that,\n",
            "[00:36:54,150 --> 00:36:56,150]  it's more complicated than that.\n",
            "[00:36:56,150 --> 00:36:58,150]  Even we have tariffs for 4G,\n",
            "[00:36:58,150 --> 00:37:04,150]  but then through different kind of campaigns and promotions,\n",
            "[00:37:04,150 --> 00:37:08,150]  there are just like mixes, right, and also the subsidy,\n",
            "[00:37:08,150 --> 00:37:09,150]  what we will provide.\n",
            "[00:37:09,150 --> 00:37:14,150]  So it's really a multifaceted question.\n",
            "[00:37:14,150 --> 00:37:17,150]  It's not just one or the other.\n",
            "[00:37:17,150 --> 00:37:23,150]  And I think every telco will have a different strategy,\n",
            "[00:37:23,150 --> 00:37:26,150]  and we're not supposed to have the same strategy.\n",
            "[00:37:26,150 --> 00:37:31,150]  That would not allow us if we are actually trying to cooperate in any way.\n",
            "[00:37:31,150 --> 00:37:34,150]  So I think everybody will have a different strategy,\n",
            "[00:37:34,150 --> 00:37:36,150]  and then some may want to drive up the adoption,\n",
            "[00:37:37,150 --> 00:37:39,150]  and then some may take it slowly.\n",
            "[00:37:39,150 --> 00:37:42,150]  Eventually it's like what are you looking for,\n",
            "[00:37:42,150 --> 00:37:45,150]  your bottom line or your P times Q?\n",
            "[00:37:45,150 --> 00:37:46,150]  You want a Q or you want a P?\n",
            "[00:37:46,150 --> 00:37:50,150]  But eventually it's P times Q that everybody should be looking at.\n",
            "[00:37:50,150 --> 00:37:51,150]  So I think it really depends,\n",
            "[00:37:51,150 --> 00:37:55,150]  and I don't have one answer or the other for you at this point.\n",
            "[00:37:55,150 --> 00:37:57,530]  Sorry.\n",
            "[00:37:57,530 --> 00:37:58,530]  Got it.\n",
            "[00:37:58,530 --> 00:37:59,560]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:37:59,560 --> 00:38:03,790]  Okay.\n",
            "[00:38:03,790 --> 00:38:06,790]  And the next one is coming from Gary Yu of Morgan Stanley.\n",
            "[00:38:06,790 --> 00:38:10,170]  Go ahead, please.\n",
            "[00:38:10,170 --> 00:38:11,170]  Hi.\n",
            "[00:38:11,170 --> 00:38:12,170]  Thank you for the opportunity to ask questions.\n",
            "[00:38:12,170 --> 00:38:14,170]  I have three questions also.\n",
            "[00:38:14,170 --> 00:38:18,170]  The first one relates to your 2020 guidance.\n",
            "[00:38:18,170 --> 00:38:22,170]  It seems to me that you're looking for the majority of the revenue growth\n",
            "[00:38:22,170 --> 00:38:29,170]  coming from the enterprise or new economy business even in 2020.\n",
            "[00:38:29,170 --> 00:38:33,170]  No, if I may correct you, that's not the case.\n",
            "[00:38:33,170 --> 00:38:38,170]  Because for enterprise, this year we would expect them to be at about\n",
            "[00:38:39,170 --> 00:38:44,170]  they reached 20% for the whole enterprise revenue in 2019.\n",
            "[00:38:44,170 --> 00:38:48,170]  They actually grew to account for 20% of the total revenue.\n",
            "[00:38:48,170 --> 00:38:53,170]  So still it is the smaller part of the whole pie that we have.\n",
            "[00:38:53,170 --> 00:38:59,170]  So we do like to see more revenue coming out of the new economy,\n",
            "[00:38:59,170 --> 00:39:04,170]  which covers both enterprise and consumer.\n",
            "[00:39:04,170 --> 00:39:08,170]  But then in order for them to really change that, you know, percentage,\n",
            "[00:39:08,170 --> 00:39:10,170]  it will take time.\n",
            "[00:39:10,170 --> 00:39:11,170]  It's not one year.\n",
            "[00:39:11,170 --> 00:39:13,170]  So they won't be the major one.\n",
            "[00:39:13,170 --> 00:39:15,390]  But then anything helps.\n",
            "[00:39:15,390 --> 00:39:16,390]  Right.\n",
            "[00:39:16,390 --> 00:39:18,390]  If you would continue.\n",
            "[00:39:18,390 --> 00:39:19,390]  Yeah.\n",
            "[00:39:19,390 --> 00:39:20,390]  Thank you for the clarification.\n",
            "[00:39:20,390 --> 00:39:25,390]  So the 3.4% revenue growth probably also assumed the consumer\n",
            "[00:39:25,390 --> 00:39:29,390]  affected to resume back to the positive growth in 2020.\n",
            "[00:39:29,390 --> 00:39:30,390]  Yes.\n",
            "[00:39:30,390 --> 00:39:31,390]  Yes.\n",
            "[00:39:31,390 --> 00:39:32,390]  It's contribution from both.\n",
            "[00:39:32,390 --> 00:39:33,420]  Yes.\n",
            "[00:39:33,420 --> 00:39:34,420]  Okay.\n",
            "[00:39:34,420 --> 00:39:35,420]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:39:35,420 --> 00:39:39,420]  And on the net income guidance of 3.2% decline,\n",
            "[00:39:39,420 --> 00:39:44,420]  how much of additional kind of spectrum amortization we have already\n",
            "[00:39:44,420 --> 00:40:01,140]  incorporated in this guidance?\n",
            "[00:40:01,140 --> 00:40:03,140]  My CFO has the details to share.\n",
            "[00:40:03,140 --> 00:40:04,140]  Yes.\n",
            "[00:40:04,140 --> 00:40:11,140]  And we expect to have around $600 million depreciation amortization\n",
            "[00:40:12,140 --> 00:40:14,140]  in year 2020 because of the spectrum.\n",
            "[00:40:14,140 --> 00:40:16,140]  Okay.\n",
            "[00:40:16,140 --> 00:40:17,140]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:40:17,140 --> 00:40:20,140]  And because you are planning to launch service in third quarter,\n",
            "[00:40:20,140 --> 00:40:23,140]  so that's about the time when we should expect amortization to start.\n",
            "[00:40:23,140 --> 00:40:24,140]  Is it correct?\n",
            "[00:40:24,140 --> 00:40:25,140]  Correct.\n",
            "[00:40:25,140 --> 00:40:26,140]  Correct.\n",
            "[00:40:26,140 --> 00:40:27,140]  Okay.\n",
            "[00:40:27,140 --> 00:40:28,360]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:40:28,360 --> 00:40:33,360]  So my second question relates to CapEx and more specifically on 5G CapEx.\n",
            "[00:40:33,360 --> 00:40:38,360]  I understand that the full year CapEx guidance is at around $10 billion.\n",
            "[00:40:39,360 --> 00:40:47,360]  How should we look at what target to achieve with the $10 billion CapEx budget?\n",
            "[00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:50,360]  Are we doing more kind of outdoor versus indoor,\n",
            "[00:40:50,360 --> 00:40:54,360]  metropolitan area versus kind of mass coverage?\n",
            "[00:40:54,360 --> 00:40:59,360]  And a related question to that is when should we expect the CapEx to peak\n",
            "[00:40:59,360 --> 00:41:03,840]  or start to kind of decline going forward?\n",
            "[00:41:03,840 --> 00:41:05,840]  Well, just like 4G, right,\n",
            "[00:41:05,840 --> 00:41:10,840]  it takes a few years to build to the network size\n",
            "[00:41:10,840 --> 00:41:13,840]  and the coverage that is desirable.\n",
            "[00:41:13,840 --> 00:41:16,840]  And then 5G is built on top of 4G,\n",
            "[00:41:16,840 --> 00:41:21,840]  and we don't expect that the whole work will be done in one or two years.\n",
            "[00:41:21,840 --> 00:41:25,840]  So we will start, since we're going to deploy the service,\n",
            "[00:41:25,840 --> 00:41:29,840]  so we want to make sure we have some reasonable coverage.\n",
            "[00:41:29,840 --> 00:41:34,840]  And then it's not restricted to one area or the other.\n",
            "[00:41:34,840 --> 00:41:37,840]  We do look at the nationwide.\n",
            "[00:41:37,840 --> 00:41:42,840]  And then next year it should have, I would expect,\n",
            "[00:41:42,840 --> 00:41:45,840]  because next year is the full year, right, so we have more time.\n",
            "[00:41:45,840 --> 00:41:50,840]  So in terms of our capacity to build more of the network, it will be more.\n",
            "[00:41:50,840 --> 00:41:55,840]  So the capital spending probably will be a little bit more than what we would this year.\n",
            "[00:41:55,840 --> 00:41:59,840]  And then it should taper off a little bit.\n",
            "[00:41:59,840 --> 00:42:02,840]  So two to three years or three, even four.\n",
            "[00:42:02,840 --> 00:42:07,840]  It also depends on how the market reacts to our 5G services.\n",
            "[00:42:07,840 --> 00:42:15,840]  So if the majority of the consumers are still kind of cold to 5G,\n",
            "[00:42:15,840 --> 00:42:17,840]  then we may slow down.\n",
            "[00:42:17,840 --> 00:42:21,840]  So this is all we want to see after we launch this year,\n",
            "[00:42:21,840 --> 00:42:24,840]  and then we can adjust our strategy for next year.\n",
            "[00:42:24,840 --> 00:42:29,020]  It doesn't need to be set in concrete.\n",
            "[00:42:29,020 --> 00:42:30,020]  Okay, thank you.\n",
            "[00:42:30,020 --> 00:42:34,020]  And my last question relates back to dividends.\n",
            "[00:42:34,020 --> 00:42:38,020]  It seems to me that according to management comment,\n",
            "[00:42:38,020 --> 00:42:44,020]  we think that the 120% payout is probably the right payout for us going forward.\n",
            "[00:42:44,020 --> 00:42:50,020]  Given our EPS guidance is going to fall in 2020,\n",
            "[00:42:50,020 --> 00:42:55,020]  and if we try to kind of incorporate a full-year amortization beyond 2020,\n",
            "[00:42:56,020 --> 00:43:02,120]  should we basically assume a similar kind of 8% decline in dividends next year\n",
            "[00:43:02,120 --> 00:43:05,120]  if we keep a 120% payout?\n",
            "[00:43:05,120 --> 00:43:07,220]  I wouldn't say that.\n",
            "[00:43:07,220 --> 00:43:10,220]  I wouldn't say that, and I really can't.\n",
            "[00:43:10,220 --> 00:43:14,040]  I don't think so.\n",
            "[00:43:14,040 --> 00:43:16,040]  Okay, and from a management perspective,\n",
            "[00:43:16,040 --> 00:43:20,040]  do we tend to look at dividend per share or payout or both?\n",
            "[00:43:20,040 --> 00:43:23,860]  We look at both.\n",
            "[00:43:23,860 --> 00:43:24,860]  We look at both.\n",
            "[00:43:24,860 --> 00:43:28,970]  Okay, got it.\n",
            "[00:43:28,970 --> 00:43:29,970]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:43:29,970 --> 00:43:39,740]  As a reminder, please press 01 on your keypad if you would like to ask a question.\n",
            "[00:43:39,740 --> 00:43:40,740]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:43:40,740 --> 00:43:48,290]  And the next question is coming from Billy Lee of Credit Suisse.\n",
            "[00:43:48,290 --> 00:43:49,290]  Go ahead, please.\n",
            "[00:43:49,290 --> 00:43:52,730]  Billy, you're now on the line.\n",
            "[00:43:52,730 --> 00:43:55,040]  Hello, hello.\n",
            "[00:43:55,040 --> 00:43:56,040]  Sorry.\n",
            "[00:43:56,040 --> 00:43:57,040]  Go ahead, please.\n",
            "[00:43:57,040 --> 00:43:58,040]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:43:58,040 --> 00:43:59,040]  Yeah, sorry.\n",
            "[00:43:59,040 --> 00:44:03,040]  Yes, thank you, management, for the opportunity to ask questions.\n",
            "[00:44:03,040 --> 00:44:09,040]  I want to ask about the second round auction of a 5G spectrum auction,\n",
            "[00:44:09,040 --> 00:44:12,040]  which are just two days away from now.\n",
            "[00:44:12,040 --> 00:44:17,040]  So I want to know what is the current progress in the negotiation with other operators\n",
            "[00:44:17,040 --> 00:44:22,040]  regarding the location, and any update would be appreciated.\n",
            "[00:44:22,040 --> 00:44:24,520]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:44:24,520 --> 00:44:30,520]  So, well, I can tell you there is no agreement that has been reached.\n",
            "[00:44:30,520 --> 00:44:35,520]  So still two days, and then, you know, anything can happen.\n",
            "[00:44:35,520 --> 00:44:41,520]  But right at this moment, I can tell you there is no agreement that has been reached yet,\n",
            "[00:44:41,520 --> 00:44:42,520]  unfortunately.\n",
            "[00:44:42,520 --> 00:44:43,870]  I see.\n",
            "[00:44:43,870 --> 00:44:45,870]  Can I follow up with you?\n",
            "[00:44:45,870 --> 00:44:51,870]  What do you think is the biggest hurdle for a good deal to come out from the negotiation?\n",
            "[00:44:51,870 --> 00:45:02,750]  I think there are different perspectives.\n",
            "[00:45:03,750 --> 00:45:04,750]  Let me tell you this.\n",
            "[00:45:04,750 --> 00:45:10,750]  And then I think every ‚Äì some company has different style in terms of how\n",
            "[00:45:10,750 --> 00:45:13,750]  or whether they would work with others.\n",
            "[00:45:13,750 --> 00:45:18,750]  So, you know, some could be more like they would like to be the lone wolf,\n",
            "[00:45:18,750 --> 00:45:24,750]  and then they just don't want to collaborate, whether you have agreement, you know, or not.\n",
            "[00:45:24,750 --> 00:45:30,750]  But then it's just four different companies, and they are competing with one another.\n",
            "[00:45:30,750 --> 00:45:36,040]  So reaching an agreement, it is a hard thing to do.\n",
            "[00:45:36,040 --> 00:45:39,260]  That's all I can say.\n",
            "[00:45:39,260 --> 00:45:43,260]  But then this whole thing hasn't been easy, has it?\n",
            "[00:45:43,260 --> 00:45:44,260]  Okay.\n",
            "[00:45:44,260 --> 00:45:46,260]  Got it.\n",
            "[00:45:46,260 --> 00:45:52,260]  And then I have another small question regarding the CapEx.\n",
            "[00:45:52,260 --> 00:45:57,260]  I noticed that in the guidance of 2020 CapEx,\n",
            "[00:45:57,260 --> 00:46:03,260]  you emphasize you haven't included one-time IDC expense.\n",
            "[00:46:03,260 --> 00:46:07,300]  How much is that, and what is that exactly?\n",
            "[00:46:07,300 --> 00:46:08,580]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:46:08,580 --> 00:46:10,580]  Yes, that would be $2 billion.\n",
            "[00:46:10,580 --> 00:46:11,580]  $2 billion.\n",
            "[00:46:11,580 --> 00:46:13,700]  Okay.\n",
            "[00:46:13,700 --> 00:46:14,700]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:46:14,700 --> 00:46:16,570]  That's my question.\n",
            "[00:46:16,570 --> 00:46:17,570]  Okay.\n",
            "[00:46:17,570 --> 00:46:23,900]  And the next one is coming from Jeff Shee of Santa Fe Securities.\n",
            "[00:46:23,900 --> 00:46:24,900]  Go ahead, please.\n",
            "[00:46:24,900 --> 00:46:31,090]  Good afternoon, and also thanks for giving me the opportunity, and I have two questions.\n",
            "[00:46:31,090 --> 00:46:37,090]  My first question is about could you give us some comments about the financial plan,\n",
            "[00:46:37,090 --> 00:46:44,090]  because the company needs more cash to pay for the spectrum\n",
            "[00:46:44,090 --> 00:46:47,090]  and also need money to pay the dividend.\n",
            "[00:46:47,090 --> 00:46:54,090]  So could you give us some comments about the financial plan for the future development?\n",
            "[00:46:54,090 --> 00:46:56,090]  This is my first question.\n",
            "[00:46:56,090 --> 00:46:58,860]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:46:58,860 --> 00:46:59,860]  Okay.\n",
            "[00:46:59,860 --> 00:47:05,860]  I think regarding the financing plan, right now, I think after this auction,\n",
            "[00:47:05,860 --> 00:47:11,860]  our debt ratio will reach around the range of 60%,\n",
            "[00:47:11,860 --> 00:47:16,860]  and that is still at the median range among Asian operators.\n",
            "[00:47:16,860 --> 00:47:21,080]  So that is still acceptable for telecom operators in this region.\n",
            "[00:47:21,080 --> 00:47:28,080]  And based on the expected capex and other spending on 5G in the next two years,\n",
            "[00:47:28,080 --> 00:47:30,080]  I think we'll be fine.\n",
            "[00:47:30,080 --> 00:47:38,080]  I mean, our financial spending, I mean, our credit capability with our banks are still doing okay.\n",
            "[00:47:38,080 --> 00:47:42,080]  Yeah, we're still pretty comfortable with the 60% where we are.\n",
            "[00:47:42,080 --> 00:47:49,200]  So that means we will loan from the banks?\n",
            "[00:47:49,200 --> 00:47:51,200]  Yes.\n",
            "[00:47:51,200 --> 00:47:52,200]  Okay.\n",
            "[00:47:52,200 --> 00:47:53,200]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:47:53,200 --> 00:48:01,190]  So, Michael, another question is could you elaborate some details about\n",
            "[00:48:01,190 --> 00:48:07,190]  between the milestone and our enterprise customers about the development of the 5G,\n",
            "[00:48:07,190 --> 00:48:20,190]  especially, I mean, which kind of method or kind of situation will go first when we develop the 5G?\n",
            "[00:48:20,190 --> 00:48:21,220]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:48:23,660 --> 00:48:24,660]  I'm sorry.\n",
            "[00:48:24,660 --> 00:48:27,660]  So are you asking, like, which verticals?\n",
            "[00:48:27,660 --> 00:48:31,660]  Or you are asking, what do you mean, what goes first?\n",
            "[00:48:31,660 --> 00:48:32,660]  Oh, yeah.\n",
            "[00:48:32,660 --> 00:48:39,660]  So, I mean, because there are many methods between milestone and enterprise.\n",
            "[00:48:39,660 --> 00:48:49,660]  Some can, they can work, I mean, they can just maybe they rent the milestone spectrum.\n",
            "[00:48:49,660 --> 00:48:55,660]  And another kind is they can cooperate with the milestone,\n",
            "[00:48:55,660 --> 00:49:06,660]  maybe also they will to also sponsor some payment for the spectrum.\n",
            "[00:49:06,660 --> 00:49:11,660]  I mean, there are different kind of ways to develop 5G in the future.\n",
            "[00:49:11,660 --> 00:49:15,660]  So in the first, right now, in the first period of time,\n",
            "[00:49:15,660 --> 00:49:21,660]  so which kind of the method will be our priorities?\n",
            "[00:49:21,660 --> 00:49:22,660]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:49:22,660 --> 00:49:23,660]  Oh, I see.\n",
            "[00:49:23,660 --> 00:49:24,660]  I see.\n",
            "[00:49:24,660 --> 00:49:25,660]  No.\n",
            "[00:49:25,660 --> 00:49:28,660]  So for the enterprise clients that we have right now,\n",
            "[00:49:28,660 --> 00:49:33,660]  they are not looking into building the, you know, the communication network themselves.\n",
            "[00:49:33,660 --> 00:49:36,660]  So we are their total solution vendor.\n",
            "[00:49:36,660 --> 00:49:41,660]  And we will work with them and with their other vendors that may help with their\n",
            "[00:49:41,660 --> 00:49:46,660]  domain-specific, you know, implementation, whatever.\n",
            "[00:49:46,660 --> 00:49:50,660]  But then we are their telecommunication solution provider.\n",
            "[00:49:50,660 --> 00:49:53,660]  So then we own the spectrum, we use the spectrum,\n",
            "[00:49:53,660 --> 00:49:57,660]  and then we, you know, design the networking solution for them.\n",
            "[00:49:57,660 --> 00:50:04,660]  And then so that's the various deals or the POCs we have been working on.\n",
            "[00:50:04,660 --> 00:50:09,460]  But then, of course, to your point, right, there's, you know,\n",
            "[00:50:09,460 --> 00:50:18,460]  some customer may look into rent or, you know, like MDNO or something like that.\n",
            "[00:50:18,460 --> 00:50:21,460]  That could happen, but then that certainly isn't our priority\n",
            "[00:50:21,460 --> 00:50:26,840]  and isn't something we have, you know, working on right now.\n",
            "[00:50:26,840 --> 00:50:27,840]  Okay.\n",
            "[00:50:27,840 --> 00:50:29,770]  Thank you, sir.\n",
            "[00:50:29,770 --> 00:50:33,940]  You're welcome.\n",
            "[00:50:33,940 --> 00:50:36,940]  And the next question is coming from Amber Lee of Yuanda.\n",
            "[00:50:36,940 --> 00:50:39,990]  Go ahead, please.\n",
            "[00:50:39,990 --> 00:50:40,990]  Hi, thanks.\n",
            "[00:50:40,990 --> 00:50:45,990]  Just to clarify, for amortization it's $600 million for this year.\n",
            "[00:50:45,990 --> 00:50:46,990]  Is that right?\n",
            "[00:50:46,990 --> 00:50:49,790]  $600 plus.\n",
            "[00:50:49,790 --> 00:50:51,790]  $600 to $700.\n",
            "[00:50:51,790 --> 00:50:52,790]  Yeah, $600 to $700.\n",
            "[00:50:52,790 --> 00:50:53,790]  $600 to $700.\n",
            "[00:50:53,790 --> 00:50:54,890]  Yes.\n",
            "[00:50:54,890 --> 00:51:01,460]  So consumer spectrum cost is about $41 billion in the first stage.\n",
            "[00:51:01,460 --> 00:51:07,460]  And if we divide that by 20 years, it's about $2 billion per year, right?\n",
            "[00:51:07,460 --> 00:51:18,460]  So as $600 and $700 million sits at about 30%, 35% of that number,\n",
            "[00:51:18,460 --> 00:51:24,500]  it sounds like we are assuming the 5G commercialization to start more towards\n",
            "[00:51:24,500 --> 00:51:27,500]  the middle or the end of the third quarter.\n",
            "[00:51:27,500 --> 00:51:30,530]  Is it the right way to look at this number?\n",
            "[00:51:30,530 --> 00:51:36,530]  Well, as I stated, we are looking to launch the 5G business in third quarter.\n",
            "[00:51:36,530 --> 00:51:42,530]  So, you know, the number we gave you is, you know, in line with that expectation.\n",
            "[00:51:42,530 --> 00:51:46,880]  Yeah, so, you know, did I answer your question?\n",
            "[00:51:46,880 --> 00:51:49,580]  Yes.\n",
            "[00:51:49,580 --> 00:51:56,580]  And does the amortization number somewhat factor in the second stage auction\n",
            "[00:51:56,580 --> 00:52:00,780]  result or has it not?\n",
            "[00:52:00,780 --> 00:52:02,070]  Yes.\n",
            "[00:52:02,070 --> 00:52:04,680]  It's all included.\n",
            "[00:52:04,680 --> 00:52:05,680]  It's a rough number.\n",
            "[00:52:06,680 --> 00:52:11,680]  So, you know, and then because the second stage is not known yet,\n",
            "[00:52:11,680 --> 00:52:14,680]  so we just use a rough number.\n",
            "[00:52:14,680 --> 00:52:16,680]  But then I think it's close enough.\n",
            "[00:52:16,680 --> 00:52:18,740]  Okay, good.\n",
            "[00:52:18,740 --> 00:52:19,740]  Got it.\n",
            "[00:52:19,740 --> 00:52:21,220]  Thank you so much.\n",
            "[00:52:21,220 --> 00:52:25,770]  Sure.\n",
            "[00:52:25,770 --> 00:52:28,770]  And the next question is coming from Billy Lee of Credit Suisse.\n",
            "[00:52:28,770 --> 00:52:29,770]  Go ahead, please.\n",
            "[00:52:29,770 --> 00:52:31,380]  Hi, management.\n",
            "[00:52:31,380 --> 00:52:33,380]  Sorry, I've got two more questions.\n",
            "[00:52:33,380 --> 00:52:34,380]  The first one.\n",
            "[00:52:34,380 --> 00:52:35,380]  No problem.\n",
            "[00:52:36,380 --> 00:52:43,380]  Yes, the first one is that so in your revenue guidance for 2020,\n",
            "[00:52:43,380 --> 00:52:48,380]  you talk about 3.4% and you say it's a combination of enterprise,\n",
            "[00:52:48,380 --> 00:52:51,380]  customer and consumer side of business growth.\n",
            "[00:52:51,380 --> 00:52:56,380]  So I want to understand a little bit further on your expectation on the consumer side.\n",
            "[00:52:56,380 --> 00:53:02,380]  So does that imply that you are expecting competition in the consumer mobile business side\n",
            "[00:53:02,380 --> 00:53:09,050]  to see a stabilization after the disruption that we've seen in the past few years?\n",
            "[00:53:09,050 --> 00:53:14,050]  Yes, I think you can say that because, after all, in the 5G business,\n",
            "[00:53:14,050 --> 00:53:20,050]  we really just have four telcos, right, competing in 5G.\n",
            "[00:53:20,050 --> 00:53:28,050]  And then even our peer, the smallest one, right, they pay big dollars as well.\n",
            "[00:53:28,050 --> 00:53:32,050]  So I think, relatively speaking, they probably feel even more pain.\n",
            "[00:53:32,050 --> 00:53:41,050]  So the disruptive kind of behavior in the past, I would expect that to be more reserved in 5G.\n",
            "[00:53:41,050 --> 00:53:49,050]  And then also, as you can see from the 2019 data, the competition definitely has cooled down.\n",
            "[00:53:49,050 --> 00:53:54,050]  And then we hope 5G, with the big cost we all have paid for,\n",
            "[00:53:54,050 --> 00:54:01,050]  and everybody just focus on fair and clean competition.\n",
            "[00:54:02,050 --> 00:54:06,040]  And I think that will likely to be the case.\n",
            "[00:54:06,040 --> 00:54:08,040]  Okay, got it. Thank you.\n",
            "[00:54:08,040 --> 00:54:13,040]  And then the second question is a little bit further on the dividend.\n",
            "[00:54:13,040 --> 00:54:22,040]  So, yeah, I know 120% and 1% dividend payout is a pretty generous number.\n",
            "[00:54:22,040 --> 00:54:27,040]  But considering your gearing level, it looks like it's actually acceptable for you guys\n",
            "[00:54:27,040 --> 00:54:32,070]  to just borrow a little bit more to maintain the absolute dividend payment.\n",
            "[00:54:32,070 --> 00:54:38,070]  How would you see that situation, like that kind of balance between gearing and dividend?\n",
            "[00:54:38,070 --> 00:54:41,860]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:54:41,860 --> 00:54:43,860]  Between what in the dividend?\n",
            "[00:54:43,860 --> 00:54:49,900]  Between borrowing and maintaining absolute dividend payment.\n",
            "[00:54:49,900 --> 00:54:53,380]  Yeah, I think it's fine, right?\n",
            "[00:54:53,380 --> 00:54:56,380]  Even Apple, with lots of cash, they borrow.\n",
            "[00:54:56,380 --> 00:55:01,380]  And not to mention the interest rate here in Taiwan is very low.\n",
            "[00:55:01,380 --> 00:55:06,380]  And we do take into consideration our debt ratio and our cash flow and all that,\n",
            "[00:55:06,380 --> 00:55:14,380]  and also our shareholders, their interest.\n",
            "[00:55:14,380 --> 00:55:18,380]  And then at the same time, our ability to continue to invest.\n",
            "[00:55:18,380 --> 00:55:21,380]  So this is all kind of considered.\n",
            "[00:55:21,380 --> 00:55:26,380]  And so we came up with 3.25, which we're fine.\n",
            "[00:55:26,380 --> 00:55:28,380]  Yes, we're fine with, totally.\n",
            "[00:55:28,380 --> 00:55:36,520]  Okay, thank you.\n",
            "[00:55:36,520 --> 00:55:38,520]  We're now in question and answer session.\n",
            "[00:55:38,520 --> 00:55:42,520]  If you would like to ask a question, please press 01 on your telephone keypad.\n",
            "[00:55:42,520 --> 00:55:47,110]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:55:47,110 --> 00:55:48,110]  There are currently no questions.\n",
            "[00:55:48,110 --> 00:55:50,110]  I'll pass the call back to Mr. Gary Lai.\n",
            "[00:55:50,110 --> 00:55:52,110]  And, Gary, please proceed.\n",
            "[00:55:52,110 --> 00:55:59,300]  Okay, thank you, everybody, to attend our fourth quarter 2019 without conference call.\n",
            "[00:56:00,300 --> 00:56:01,300]  See you next quarter.\n",
            "[00:56:01,300 --> 00:56:06,300]  And if there are any more questions that didn't get answered or didn't get asked,\n",
            "[00:56:06,300 --> 00:56:09,300]  we can always have some follow-up calls or visits\n",
            "[00:56:09,300 --> 00:56:12,300]  when people feel free to travel these days.\n",
            "[00:56:12,300 --> 00:56:14,300]  So, yeah, we'll be here.\n",
            "[00:56:14,300 --> 00:56:16,300]  So if you have questions that we didn't get to answer,\n",
            "[00:56:16,300 --> 00:56:20,300]  please do not hesitate to contact us and contact Gary.\n",
            "[00:56:20,300 --> 00:56:21,300]  Thank you very much.\n",
            "[00:56:21,300 --> 00:56:22,300]  Thank you all.\n",

            "[00:00:31,030 --> 00:00:36,030]  And now I would like to introduce Mr. Gary Lai, the IR Officer.\n",
            "[00:00:36,030 --> 00:00:38,030]  And Gary, please begin.\n",
            "[00:00:38,030 --> 00:00:45,450]  Good afternoon everyone. Welcome to participate FireEastone's 3rd Quarter 2019 Results Conference Call.\n",
            "[00:00:45,450 --> 00:00:51,450]  Both our President Qi and CFO Sherman are here on the call with us today.\n",
            "[00:00:52,450 --> 00:00:56,450]  Before starting our President Qi's brief presentation,\n",
            "[00:00:56,450 --> 00:01:00,450]  please pay attention to our safe harbor statement on the first page.\n",
            "[00:01:00,450 --> 00:01:02,450]  Let me pass to Qi, please.\n",
            "[00:01:02,450 --> 00:01:05,990]  Okay, good afternoon everyone. Thank you for coming.\n",
            "[00:01:05,990 --> 00:01:13,990]  I would just quickly go over our 3rd Quarter operational performance and let's start with the mobile market in Taiwan.\n",
            "[00:01:13,990 --> 00:01:20,990]  As you could tell from the chart we shared here, on the left-hand side it is the market mobile revenue.\n",
            "[00:01:20,990 --> 00:01:24,990]  It is not to anybody's surprise that it is still declining.\n",
            "[00:01:24,990 --> 00:01:29,990]  However, the silver lining is the revenue decline did improve.\n",
            "[00:01:29,990 --> 00:01:31,990]  So it is slowing down.\n",
            "[00:01:31,990 --> 00:01:35,990]  So compared year-over-year for the 3rd Quarter,\n",
            "[00:01:35,990 --> 00:01:44,990]  then we are looking at minus 5.1% versus 15.6 last quarter and then the quarters before.\n",
            "[00:01:44,990 --> 00:01:46,990]  So that is a good thing.\n",
            "[00:01:46,990 --> 00:01:50,990]  Then on the right-hand side we show the mobile number portability,\n",
            "[00:01:50,990 --> 00:01:57,990]  which indicates the churns, the customers that traverse between the carriers.\n",
            "[00:01:57,990 --> 00:02:02,990]  As you can tell, the numbers have come down and then stabilized.\n",
            "[00:02:02,990 --> 00:02:11,990]  So in terms of the competition amount, in the MP category in particular, it is cooling down,\n",
            "[00:02:11,990 --> 00:02:15,990]  which is healthier as far as we are concerned.\n",
            "[00:02:15,990 --> 00:02:22,990]  In terms of Far East Zone's operational performance, if you look at our post-phase subscriptions,\n",
            "[00:02:22,990 --> 00:02:28,990]  it has been continuing to grow and then actually it is like 5 quarters in a row.\n",
            "[00:02:28,990 --> 00:02:31,990]  This is very good performance.\n",
            "[00:02:31,990 --> 00:02:34,990]  I think the Far East Zone team has done a great job.\n",
            "[00:02:34,990 --> 00:02:41,990]  When we were looking at this last year and then we were forecasting at best this will be kind of staying flat,\n",
            "[00:02:41,990 --> 00:02:46,990]  if not decreasing slightly, but then it is against what we have expected.\n",
            "[00:02:46,990 --> 00:02:49,990]  It is definitely doing really, really well there.\n",
            "[00:02:49,990 --> 00:02:58,990]  In terms of the post-phase churn, it has been going down and then kind of stayed flat at a 1.4-ish percentage,\n",
            "[00:02:58,990 --> 00:03:01,990]  which is also very good.\n",
            "[00:03:01,990 --> 00:03:04,990]  That is in the telecom area.\n",
            "[00:03:04,990 --> 00:03:12,990]  When it comes to our new economy, especially in our enterprise sector, you can see from the four circles,\n",
            "[00:03:12,990 --> 00:03:20,990]  these are the kind of signature services our enterprise business unit has offered to our clients\n",
            "[00:03:20,990 --> 00:03:24,990]  and has been our focus of the business for the last two years.\n",
            "[00:03:24,990 --> 00:03:30,990]  On the cloud service revenue side, you see the increase is like more than five times.\n",
            "[00:03:30,990 --> 00:03:35,990]  Of course, this does include our acquisition of NextLink\n",
            "[00:03:35,990 --> 00:03:40,990]  and it reflected the addition of the revenue from that subsidiary.\n",
            "[00:03:40,990 --> 00:03:48,990]  However, even with that, the growth, including the growth of the subsidiary, is very impressive.\n",
            "[00:03:48,990 --> 00:03:56,990]  For the IoT revenue, it is almost two times, 200% of what we have year over year.\n",
            "[00:03:57,990 --> 00:04:03,990]  Then the security revenue, I remember I think probably the first investor call I had with you,\n",
            "[00:04:03,990 --> 00:04:07,990]  and the number on the security was about 43% increase.\n",
            "[00:04:07,990 --> 00:04:11,990]  Now we are looking at 65% year over year.\n",
            "[00:04:11,990 --> 00:04:19,990]  Then in terms of the SI, the ICT projects in general that are outside of these particular services we just mentioned,\n",
            "[00:04:19,990 --> 00:04:25,990]  the revenue growth there is also 64%.\n",
            "[00:04:26,990 --> 00:04:31,990]  We have very high expectations for this area\n",
            "[00:04:31,990 --> 00:04:35,990]  and we do consider new economy as our growth engine.\n",
            "[00:04:35,990 --> 00:04:41,280]  Then these areas are performing very well as we expected.\n",
            "[00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:47,280]  Now in terms of how we are doing in achieving our board of directors target,\n",
            "[00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:52,280]  this chart just gives you a brief kind of glance.\n",
            "[00:04:52,280 --> 00:05:00,280]  When it comes to the total revenue, for the third quarter we are meeting our board expectation.\n",
            "[00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:02,280]  We achieved the target.\n",
            "[00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:07,850]  Then on the EPSI, it's 103%.\n",
            "[00:05:07,850 --> 00:05:13,850]  With that, I'm going to have Sherman, our CFO, to share more financial details with you all.\n",
            "[00:05:13,850 --> 00:05:15,850]  Good afternoon.\n",
            "[00:05:15,850 --> 00:05:23,010]  The EBITDA margin for the third quarter is $7.191 billion.\n",
            "[00:05:23,010 --> 00:05:27,010]  The margin is 33.6%.\n",
            "[00:05:27,010 --> 00:05:32,010]  However, I want to remind you that this is based on IFRS 16,\n",
            "[00:05:32,010 --> 00:05:36,010]  which treats rental and other lease contracts as assets.\n",
            "[00:05:36,010 --> 00:05:41,010]  If we really want to compare against last year on the Apple to Apple basis,\n",
            "[00:05:41,010 --> 00:05:43,010]  so-called pre-IFRS 16,\n",
            "[00:05:43,010 --> 00:05:53,390]  then the EBITDA margin will be better than the fourth quarter last year,\n",
            "[00:05:53,390 --> 00:05:55,390]  but worse than the third quarter last year.\n",
            "[00:05:55,390 --> 00:06:03,390]  The net income for this year, for third quarter, is stabilized at $2.195 billion.\n",
            "[00:06:03,390 --> 00:06:07,390]  So you can see that actually the three quarters this year,\n",
            "[00:06:07,390 --> 00:06:13,390]  the net income has been pretty stable, around $2.2 billion plus and minus.\n",
            "[00:06:13,390 --> 00:06:16,390]  So we're running at a stable pace.\n",
            "[00:06:16,390 --> 00:06:21,550]  Next page, if we look at a consolidated financial result,\n",
            "[00:06:22,550 --> 00:06:27,550]  the first column is the result for the third quarter this year.\n",
            "[00:06:27,550 --> 00:06:30,550]  The total revenue is $21.4 billion.\n",
            "[00:06:30,550 --> 00:06:35,550]  Against the guidance, we're at 100% achievement rate.\n",
            "[00:06:35,550 --> 00:06:42,550]  For the first three quarters this year, the total revenue is $62.65 billion,\n",
            "[00:06:42,550 --> 00:06:45,710]  which is 3% higher than the guidance.\n",
            "[00:06:46,710 --> 00:06:51,710]  For operating expense, the third quarter is $3.657 billion,\n",
            "[00:06:51,710 --> 00:06:56,830]  which is lower than the guidance by 6%.\n",
            "[00:06:56,830 --> 00:07:02,830]  The nine months of this year, the total operating expense is $10.938 billion,\n",
            "[00:07:02,830 --> 00:07:06,440]  which is 4% lower than the guidance.\n",
            "[00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:14,440]  The EBITDA, which is IFRS 16, is $7.191 billion, 100% achievement rate.\n",
            "[00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:19,540]  And then for the three quarters is $22.06 billion,\n",
            "[00:07:19,540 --> 00:07:22,540]  which is 2% higher than the guidance.\n",
            "[00:07:22,540 --> 00:07:26,540]  And the net income for the third quarter is $2.195 billion,\n",
            "[00:07:26,540 --> 00:07:28,540]  3% higher than guidance.\n",
            "[00:07:28,540 --> 00:07:31,540]  And the three quarters together is $6.6 billion,\n",
            "[00:07:31,540 --> 00:07:35,540]  which is 4% higher than the guidance.\n",
            "[00:07:35,540 --> 00:07:39,540]  So the EPS for third quarter is $0.67.\n",
            "[00:07:39,540 --> 00:07:43,540]  For the first nine months is $2.03.\n",
            "[00:07:43,540 --> 00:07:51,140]  The next page is talking about the balance sheet and some other cash flow.\n",
            "[00:07:51,140 --> 00:07:56,140]  So the cash on hand at the end of third quarter is $5.16 billion,\n",
            "[00:07:56,140 --> 00:08:00,140]  which is lower than the second quarter because the dividend payout,\n",
            "[00:08:00,140 --> 00:08:02,140]  $12 billion during third quarters.\n",
            "[00:08:02,140 --> 00:08:04,140]  And the total borrowing,\n",
            "[00:08:04,140 --> 00:08:08,140]  the net debt increased from $19 billion at the end of second quarter\n",
            "[00:08:09,140 --> 00:08:14,140]  to the third quarter because of the dividend payout.\n",
            "[00:08:14,140 --> 00:08:19,140]  And the shareholder's equity, right now we stand at $68.44 billion.\n",
            "[00:08:19,140 --> 00:08:26,370]  And net debt to EBITDA is $1.08 times EBITDA,\n",
            "[00:08:26,370 --> 00:08:30,370]  which is within the normal range of iteration.\n",
            "[00:08:30,370 --> 00:08:36,370]  And the free cash flow for year to date is $10.8 billion.\n",
            "[00:08:36,370 --> 00:08:38,370]  But there's a footnote.\n",
            "[00:08:38,370 --> 00:08:43,370]  The end of September, the last working day of September,\n",
            "[00:08:43,370 --> 00:08:45,370]  which actually there was a typhoon,\n",
            "[00:08:45,370 --> 00:08:50,370]  and so there was $1.8 billion payable,\n",
            "[00:08:50,370 --> 00:08:53,370]  including tax and some other payable that didn't happen.\n",
            "[00:08:53,370 --> 00:08:58,370]  And that makes the free cash flow inflated by $1.8 billion.\n",
            "[00:08:58,370 --> 00:09:03,370]  But that $1.8 billion will be paid in the fourth quarter.\n",
            "[00:09:03,370 --> 00:09:10,530]  And the cash base, the capex, for the three quarters together is $4.296 billion.\n",
            "[00:09:10,530 --> 00:09:14,530]  And then the EPS that we set is $2.33.\n",
            "[00:09:14,530 --> 00:09:18,930]  That concludes my financial updates.\n",
            "[00:09:18,930 --> 00:09:21,930]  So I will turn this back to Chi.\n",
            "[00:09:21,930 --> 00:09:22,930]  Okay.\n",
            "[00:09:22,930 --> 00:09:27,930]  Just a few management highlights for what we have accomplished in the third quarter.\n",
            "[00:09:27,930 --> 00:09:31,930]  In particular, these are some awards that we have received\n",
            "[00:09:31,930 --> 00:09:33,930]  or recognition we have received,\n",
            "[00:09:33,930 --> 00:09:38,930]  which reflect the Far Eastern team's accomplishments in general.\n",
            "[00:09:38,930 --> 00:09:42,930]  For example, we have been very focusing on the customer satisfaction,\n",
            "[00:09:42,930 --> 00:09:43,930]  customer service.\n",
            "[00:09:43,930 --> 00:09:49,930]  So I'm happy to report that we actually won the 2019 Customer Service Excellence Award\n",
            "[00:09:49,930 --> 00:09:54,930]  from Taiwan Contact Center Development Association, which is a big award.\n",
            "[00:09:54,930 --> 00:10:01,930]  And we conceded this as one of the primary awards that indicates the service level.\n",
            "[00:10:01,930 --> 00:10:03,930]  So that is a great honor.\n",
            "[00:10:03,930 --> 00:10:08,930]  And then we were also honored as the best telecom operator against the scammers.\n",
            "[00:10:08,930 --> 00:10:16,150]  And we actually received a recognition from our Criminal Investigation Bureau.\n",
            "[00:10:16,150 --> 00:10:23,150]  And then because we used big data and AI machine learning to actually help capture the fraud cases,\n",
            "[00:10:23,150 --> 00:10:26,310]  the fraudulent calls, and then the callers.\n",
            "[00:10:26,310 --> 00:10:32,910]  So that was something we got to our community, our society on the side.\n",
            "[00:10:32,910 --> 00:10:36,910]  And then when it comes to innovation, as you all know,\n",
            "[00:10:36,910 --> 00:10:42,910]  we have been focusing on software development and then also our capabilities in big data,\n",
            "[00:10:42,910 --> 00:10:44,910]  AI, and IoT.\n",
            "[00:10:44,910 --> 00:10:48,910]  And then when we created the Transformation Office last year,\n",
            "[00:10:48,910 --> 00:10:53,910]  we have a team that is focusing on these technology-related applications,\n",
            "[00:10:53,910 --> 00:10:55,910]  development, and all that.\n",
            "[00:10:55,910 --> 00:11:01,910]  And the team received the Red Hat APAC Innovation Award for the digital transformation\n",
            "[00:11:01,910 --> 00:11:04,910]  and the DevOps model that we have implemented.\n",
            "[00:11:04,910 --> 00:11:09,910]  And then also we created this application enablement platform,\n",
            "[00:11:09,910 --> 00:11:13,910]  which we call CAD that connects all things for our IoT applications,\n",
            "[00:11:13,910 --> 00:11:15,910]  which is already monetized.\n",
            "[00:11:15,910 --> 00:11:20,910]  And we have commercial services put on the platform.\n",
            "[00:11:20,910 --> 00:11:24,140]  And then we also cooperated with Taipei City\n",
            "[00:11:25,140 --> 00:11:29,140]  and then created this Taiwan's first proof of business,\n",
            "[00:11:29,140 --> 00:11:33,140]  DOB, Field Experiment Center for 5G.\n",
            "[00:11:33,140 --> 00:11:38,140]  And this is where we already have 35 companies that came in.\n",
            "[00:11:38,140 --> 00:11:44,140]  That includes government agencies and device makers, you know, PC makers, you name it,\n",
            "[00:11:44,140 --> 00:11:50,140]  quite a few manufacturers in the different domains that will use the 5G connectivity.\n",
            "[00:11:50,140 --> 00:11:55,140]  And then so a lot of testing and experiments are going on in the lab.\n",
            "[00:11:55,140 --> 00:12:00,140]  And so far we already have 35 companies that came in.\n",
            "[00:12:00,140 --> 00:12:03,140]  And then we also launched the first online collapse\n",
            "[00:12:03,140 --> 00:12:06,140]  and turbidity forecast system in Taiwan.\n",
            "[00:12:06,140 --> 00:12:12,140]  And then this is one of the IoT applications we collaborated with our partners\n",
            "[00:12:12,140 --> 00:12:15,300]  and for our government agency.\n",
            "[00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:20,300]  And then also, and we are happy to report that,\n",
            "[00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:28,300]  we were awarded most outstanding company in Taiwan in the telecom service sector by Asia Money.\n",
            "[00:12:28,300 --> 00:12:34,300]  And then we also, this is the first time we were accepted by Dow Jones Sustainability\n",
            "[00:12:34,300 --> 00:12:39,300]  and we actually entered a world index, which is really a great achievement.\n",
            "[00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:43,300]  And then we have several CSR recognitions.\n",
            "[00:12:43,300 --> 00:12:48,300]  So this is just something we continue to do and then we take it really seriously that, you know,\n",
            "[00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:54,300]  this is our corporate responsibility and social responsibility for our community.\n",
            "[00:12:54,300 --> 00:12:56,300]  So we'll continue to do that.\n",
            "[00:12:56,300 --> 00:13:03,300]  And as far as our fourth quarter focus is concerned, as all we know, right,\n",
            "[00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:07,300]  and then this is the 5G auction is heated up.\n",
            "[00:13:07,300 --> 00:13:13,300]  So very soon we're going to have the auction starts on the 10th of December.\n",
            "[00:13:13,300 --> 00:13:20,300]  And next week we're going to have an interview with our NCC so they can just, you know,\n",
            "[00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:25,300]  that is a prerequisite for those qualified bidders, right.\n",
            "[00:13:25,300 --> 00:13:29,300]  This is one step closer to the bidding.\n",
            "[00:13:29,300 --> 00:13:31,300]  So we will have that next week.\n",
            "[00:13:31,300 --> 00:13:35,300]  And then so we have been preparing for the 5G deployment.\n",
            "[00:13:35,300 --> 00:13:40,300]  A lot of the, you know, network upgrade and all that is ongoing and site surveys and all that.\n",
            "[00:13:40,300 --> 00:13:45,300]  So that is something we will continue to focus on.\n",
            "[00:13:45,300 --> 00:13:54,300]  And then also in the new economy area, you know, with 5G or not, this has been our focus.\n",
            "[00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:58,300]  But then 5G will also help boost, you know, the business in that area as well.\n",
            "[00:13:58,300 --> 00:14:02,300]  So we will continue our focus in those areas as well.\n",
            "[00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:08,300]  And then with 5G, and actually when we started the IOT business,\n",
            "[00:14:08,300 --> 00:14:15,300]  we already see the need, the critical needs for having the good partners and then having an ecosystem.\n",
            "[00:14:15,300 --> 00:14:20,300]  So we will continue to expand and strengthen our cross-field, cross-industry partnership.\n",
            "[00:14:20,300 --> 00:14:25,300]  And also, of course, we will continue to drive down operations costs,\n",
            "[00:14:25,300 --> 00:14:31,300]  especially when growing revenue is really, really hard on the mobile service sector.\n",
            "[00:14:31,300 --> 00:14:38,300]  So driving the cost down with AI, with automation is something we will continue to do internally.\n",
            "[00:14:38,300 --> 00:14:47,460]  And last but not least, we will continue to improve our employees as well as the customer satisfaction.\n",
            "[00:14:47,460 --> 00:14:49,460]  So we always say customer first.\n",
            "[00:14:49,460 --> 00:14:52,460]  But then, you know, employees are our biggest customers ourselves.\n",
            "[00:14:52,460 --> 00:14:54,460]  So we will need to take care of people.\n",
            "[00:14:54,460 --> 00:14:58,460]  So this is something we'll continue to improve and do better.\n",
            "[00:14:59,550 --> 00:15:02,550]  Okay, with that, I think we are ready for Q&A.\n",
            "[00:15:02,550 --> 00:15:04,550]  Gary, back to you.\n",
            "[00:15:04,550 --> 00:15:09,020]  We'll start Q&A session, please.\n",
            "[00:15:09,020 --> 00:15:10,020]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:15:10,020 --> 00:15:14,020]  And ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin our question and answer session.\n",
            "[00:15:14,020 --> 00:15:20,020]  If you have a question for any of today's speakers, please press 01 on your telephone keypad,\n",
            "[00:15:20,020 --> 00:15:22,020]  and you will enter the queue.\n",
            "[00:15:22,020 --> 00:15:25,020]  After you are announced, please ask your question.\n",
            "[00:15:25,020 --> 00:15:30,020]  If you find that your question has been answered before it is your turn to speak,\n",
            "[00:15:30,020 --> 00:15:33,020]  please press 02 to cancel the question.\n",
            "[00:15:33,020 --> 00:15:34,630]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:15:34,630 --> 00:15:39,630]  Now please press 01 on your telephone keypad if you would like to ask a question.\n",
            "[00:15:39,630 --> 00:15:41,620]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:15:41,620 --> 00:15:43,620]  We are now in question and answer session.\n",
            "[00:15:43,620 --> 00:15:48,620]  If you would like to ask a question, please press 01 on your telephone keypad.\n",
            "[00:15:48,620 --> 00:15:49,620]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:15:49,620 --> 00:15:54,300]  And the first question is coming from Gary E. of Morgan Stanley.\n",
            "[00:15:54,300 --> 00:15:56,780]  Go ahead, please.\n",
            "[00:15:56,780 --> 00:15:57,780]  Hi.\n",
            "[00:15:57,780 --> 00:15:58,780]  Thank you for the opportunity to ask questions.\n",
            "[00:15:58,780 --> 00:16:03,780]  I just have one question on some early outlook in 2020.\n",
            "[00:16:03,780 --> 00:16:12,780]  Given the potential impact from early 5G options and also there are some early signs of stabilization\n",
            "[00:16:12,780 --> 00:16:18,780]  in the mobile competition in recent months, should we expect the mobile revenue to return\n",
            "[00:16:18,780 --> 00:16:21,780]  to positive growth when we go into 2020?\n",
            "[00:16:21,780 --> 00:16:24,580]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:16:25,580 --> 00:16:31,580]  Well, so with 5G, we do expect that, you know, like the price uplifts.\n",
            "[00:16:31,580 --> 00:16:34,580]  But then, as you know, the adoption will take time.\n",
            "[00:16:34,580 --> 00:16:41,580]  And the loss on the mobile revenue by 499 is huge.\n",
            "[00:16:41,580 --> 00:16:47,580]  So we do not expect, even though we are hopeful, but then I definitely would not expect this\n",
            "[00:16:47,580 --> 00:16:49,580]  is something that will turn around in a year.\n",
            "[00:16:49,580 --> 00:16:54,580]  But then maybe to three to four years, we will see, you know, the positive turn.\n",
            "[00:16:54,580 --> 00:16:58,580]  But then in the meantime, it will improve the situation.\n",
            "[00:16:58,580 --> 00:17:03,580]  But then to see a real, you know, to turn it around totally, I think it should take\n",
            "[00:17:03,580 --> 00:17:07,580]  three to four years, given 5G is still kind of relatively new.\n",
            "[00:17:07,580 --> 00:17:11,580]  And then the services that will mature and then, you know, that will be well received\n",
            "[00:17:11,580 --> 00:17:14,580]  by the public, that will take some time to warm up.\n",
            "[00:17:14,580 --> 00:17:15,580]  Okay.\n",
            "[00:17:15,580 --> 00:17:16,580]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:17:16,580 --> 00:17:17,580]  Sure.\n",
            "[00:17:17,580 --> 00:17:21,580]  And the next question is coming from Gary Lee of Credit Suisse.\n",
            "[00:17:21,580 --> 00:17:22,580]  Go ahead, please.\n",
            "[00:17:22,580 --> 00:17:24,570]  Hi.\n",
            "[00:17:24,570 --> 00:17:26,730]  Thanks, management, for the presentation.\n",
            "[00:17:26,730 --> 00:17:27,730]  I have one question.\n",
            "[00:17:27,730 --> 00:17:28,730]  Sure.\n",
            "[00:17:28,730 --> 00:17:30,730]  On the new business.\n",
            "[00:17:30,730 --> 00:17:37,620]  So Chung-Hua talked about intensive society.\n",
            "[00:17:37,620 --> 00:17:45,180]  Just wondering, like, on your side, do you see that happening?\n",
            "[00:17:45,180 --> 00:17:50,180]  And could you also talk about the general margin profile?\n",
            "[00:17:50,180 --> 00:17:52,740]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:17:52,740 --> 00:17:53,740]  Okay.\n",
            "[00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:55,740]  All right.\n",
            "[00:17:55,740 --> 00:18:00,740]  Yeah, we did see that statement made by our peer, you know, Chung-Hua.\n",
            "[00:18:00,740 --> 00:18:05,740]  And, you know, I have to say, I think we probably were guilty to that.\n",
            "[00:18:05,740 --> 00:18:10,740]  So while they are saying, you know, there's competition, and then there is definitely\n",
            "[00:18:10,740 --> 00:18:11,740]  competition.\n",
            "[00:18:11,740 --> 00:18:15,740]  As you know, Chung-Hua, you know, historically was government-owned.\n",
            "[00:18:15,740 --> 00:18:20,740]  So in the government sector, they do have the almost like an incumbent, you know,\n",
            "[00:18:20,740 --> 00:18:21,740]  advantage.\n",
            "[00:18:21,740 --> 00:18:24,740]  So for us, it was fierce competition.\n",
            "[00:18:24,740 --> 00:18:26,740]  But then we did win a few cases.\n",
            "[00:18:26,740 --> 00:18:28,740]  So that's what I saw.\n",
            "[00:18:28,740 --> 00:18:32,740]  But then, as you know, I conceded them the incumbent.\n",
            "[00:18:32,740 --> 00:18:37,740]  So for Far Eastern to make more progress, and then we just have to do better and\n",
            "[00:18:37,740 --> 00:18:40,740]  we have to work even harder.\n",
            "[00:18:40,740 --> 00:18:41,740]  Okay.\n",
            "[00:18:41,740 --> 00:18:46,740]  Now, in terms of a margin, you know, the margin is okay.\n",
            "[00:18:46,740 --> 00:18:50,740]  But then I would like, you know, because at the beginning, you know, just\n",
            "[00:18:50,740 --> 00:18:55,740]  especially with a competition like Chung-Hua, it's almost like a force that's\n",
            "[00:18:55,740 --> 00:18:57,740]  not be able to be very choosy.\n",
            "[00:18:57,740 --> 00:18:59,740]  We cannot really pick and choose.\n",
            "[00:18:59,740 --> 00:19:00,740]  Right?\n",
            "[00:19:00,740 --> 00:19:02,740]  So anytime we have an opportunity, we like to grab it.\n",
            "[00:19:02,740 --> 00:19:07,740]  And then this is how we can increase our market share and our influence, right,\n",
            "[00:19:07,740 --> 00:19:08,740]  our position.\n",
            "[00:19:08,740 --> 00:19:11,740]  But then I think, you know, after a year or two, you know, the team has really\n",
            "[00:19:11,740 --> 00:19:16,740]  done very well, right, even Chung-Hua still some competition.\n",
            "[00:19:17,740 --> 00:19:21,740]  And then so I think, you know, in the year going forward, I would like our team\n",
            "[00:19:21,740 --> 00:19:23,740]  to be more selective.\n",
            "[00:19:23,740 --> 00:19:27,740]  And then so we can, you know, we can have the margin, we can, you know,\n",
            "[00:19:27,740 --> 00:19:29,740]  improve the margin more.\n",
            "[00:19:29,740 --> 00:19:36,740]  And then with more efficient efforts, I guess, the effectiveness can even\n",
            "[00:19:36,740 --> 00:19:37,740]  increase.\n",
            "[00:19:37,740 --> 00:19:41,740]  But then for what we have, because we always have our criteria for what kind\n",
            "[00:19:41,740 --> 00:19:45,740]  of, you know, cases we will work on.\n",
            "[00:19:45,740 --> 00:19:46,740]  So it is okay.\n",
            "[00:19:46,740 --> 00:19:48,740]  But then I always like it better.\n",
            "[00:19:48,740 --> 00:19:49,740]  There's not best.\n",
            "[00:19:49,740 --> 00:19:51,740]  It's only better.\n",
            "[00:19:51,740 --> 00:19:52,740]  Right.\n",
            "[00:19:52,740 --> 00:19:55,960]  But do you have a rough number on the numbers?\n",
            "[00:19:55,960 --> 00:20:00,620]  I just want to have that.\n",
            "[00:20:00,620 --> 00:20:02,030]  Let me see.\n",
            "[00:20:02,030 --> 00:20:06,030]  Let me check with my ‚Äì I didn't really get a latest number on that.\n",
            "[00:20:06,030 --> 00:20:07,030]  Yes.\n",
            "[00:20:07,030 --> 00:20:12,030]  I mean, the general rule is that we won't do any project lower than 10%.\n",
            "[00:20:12,030 --> 00:20:18,920]  So our average range will be range from 10% to 15% on this.\n",
            "[00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:19,920]  Right.\n",
            "[00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:23,920]  And then, you know, and also, as you know, we have had some huge, you know,\n",
            "[00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:27,920]  cases, and we are talking about billions of the revenue amount.\n",
            "[00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:30,920]  So then that's where you need to bend the rule a little bit.\n",
            "[00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:34,920]  But then in general, what Sherman just said, that's about right.\n",
            "[00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:36,980]  That's helpful.\n",
            "[00:20:36,980 --> 00:20:38,390]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:20:38,390 --> 00:20:39,390]  Sure.\n",
            "[00:20:39,390 --> 00:20:46,690]  If you would like to ask a question, please press 01 on your telephone keypad.\n",
            "[00:20:46,690 --> 00:20:47,690]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:20:47,690 --> 00:20:53,130]  And the next question we have, Amber Lee of Yuen Da.\n",
            "[00:20:53,130 --> 00:20:54,130]  Go ahead, please.\n",
            "[00:20:54,130 --> 00:20:56,700]  Hi.\n",
            "[00:20:56,700 --> 00:20:59,700]  I have a question about a new economy business.\n",
            "[00:20:59,700 --> 00:21:07,700]  So overall, in third quarter, what's the growth rate in this business on worldwide basis?\n",
            "[00:21:07,700 --> 00:21:14,700]  And also, Benjamin mentioned that Farmingstone took some shares from Zonghua,\n",
            "[00:21:14,700 --> 00:21:19,700]  and which categories that can be seen in the slides?\n",
            "[00:21:19,700 --> 00:21:27,670]  Well, which slide are we referring to, the one I have in the four circles?\n",
            "[00:21:28,670 --> 00:21:36,370]  So I think a high percentage of our ICT business, right, last year,\n",
            "[00:21:36,370 --> 00:21:40,370]  that includes some IoT security as well.\n",
            "[00:21:40,370 --> 00:21:46,370]  So a big part of it came from the government sector.\n",
            "[00:21:46,370 --> 00:21:52,370]  So government sector definitely is where we will meet Zonghua as one of the bidders, right?\n",
            "[00:21:52,370 --> 00:21:54,370]  So that definitely is one area.\n",
            "[00:21:54,370 --> 00:22:00,370]  And in the other areas, you know, big and small, I don't really have all those data in front of us,\n",
            "[00:22:00,370 --> 00:22:07,370]  but then I think it's safe to say in this government sector where Zonghua used to be the provider\n",
            "[00:22:07,370 --> 00:22:16,660]  and now they start to meet some competition, including Far Eastern.\n",
            "[00:22:16,660 --> 00:22:22,660]  Our overall new economy growth, 17% year on year, I mean year to date.\n",
            "[00:22:22,660 --> 00:22:30,260]  Okay, then what about a sales percentage in third quarter or YTD basis?\n",
            "[00:22:30,260 --> 00:22:42,350]  Right now it's up at 12% over the total revenue.\n",
            "[00:22:42,350 --> 00:22:47,240]  On track to the annual target?\n",
            "[00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:50,640]  Okay, thank you.\n",
            "[00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:55,020]  We are now in question and answer session.\n",
            "[00:22:55,020 --> 00:22:59,020]  If you would like to ask a question, please press 01 on your telephone keypad.\n",
            "[00:22:59,020 --> 00:23:00,020]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:23:00,020 --> 00:23:05,650]  And the next question is coming from Shai Luo of HSBC.\n",
            "[00:23:05,650 --> 00:23:06,650]  Go ahead, please.\n",
            "[00:23:06,650 --> 00:23:10,660]  Ms. Luo, you are on the line?\n",
            "[00:23:10,660 --> 00:23:11,950]  Yeah, hi.\n",
            "[00:23:11,950 --> 00:23:17,950]  I would like to ask you about the contribution of new economy services to the overall service revenues.\n",
            "[00:23:17,950 --> 00:23:19,950]  Sorry, I didn't get that part earlier.\n",
            "[00:23:19,950 --> 00:23:20,950]  I'm sorry.\n",
            "[00:23:20,950 --> 00:23:25,330]  Could you repeat that and slow down a little bit?\n",
            "[00:23:25,330 --> 00:23:28,000]  Yeah.\n",
            "[00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:34,000]  What is the contribution of new economy services to the total service revenue?\n",
            "[00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:37,740]  That's the answer we just gave.\n",
            "[00:23:37,740 --> 00:23:40,740]  You know, it's about 12% right now, year to date.\n",
            "[00:23:40,740 --> 00:23:42,740]  Yeah, 12%.\n",
            "[00:23:42,740 --> 00:23:43,740]  Yeah, 12%.\n",
            "[00:23:43,740 --> 00:23:44,740]  Okay, got it.\n",
            "[00:23:44,740 --> 00:23:45,830]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:23:45,830 --> 00:23:48,830]  And the next question is coming from Gary Lee of Credit Suisse.\n",
            "[00:23:48,830 --> 00:23:49,830]  Go ahead, please.\n",
            "[00:23:49,830 --> 00:23:52,890]  Hi, it's Billy again.\n",
            "[00:23:52,890 --> 00:23:54,890]  I have two more questions.\n",
            "[00:23:54,890 --> 00:23:56,890]  First one is on CapEx guidance.\n",
            "[00:23:56,890 --> 00:23:59,890]  I noticed you earlier gave a guidance.\n",
            "[00:23:59,890 --> 00:24:01,890]  Gary, would you speak up a little bit?\n",
            "[00:24:01,890 --> 00:24:04,890]  You came in really soft and it's a little bit hard to hear.\n",
            "[00:24:04,890 --> 00:24:06,890]  Oh, sure, sure.\n",
            "[00:24:06,890 --> 00:24:12,890]  Yeah, earlier I noticed that you gave a CapEx guidance of $8 billion.\n",
            "[00:24:12,890 --> 00:24:17,890]  So, I'm wondering, given that now nine months, year to date,\n",
            "[00:24:17,890 --> 00:24:20,890]  you're spending only $4.3 billion.\n",
            "[00:24:20,890 --> 00:24:23,890]  Are you still maintaining the guidance on CapEx?\n",
            "[00:24:23,890 --> 00:24:24,890]  That's the first question.\n",
            "[00:24:24,890 --> 00:24:26,620]  Yes.\n",
            "[00:24:26,620 --> 00:24:32,620]  We still intend to maintain the CapEx spending by the end of this year.\n",
            "[00:24:32,620 --> 00:24:37,550]  And I think there was a delay of the TPP payment, right?\n",
            "[00:24:37,550 --> 00:24:40,550]  Yeah, there's some delay of the CapEx spending,\n",
            "[00:24:40,550 --> 00:24:43,550]  but I think we're going to catch up on the first quarter.\n",
            "[00:24:43,550 --> 00:24:45,610]  Okay, got it.\n",
            "[00:24:45,610 --> 00:24:53,800]  And then another question is on the impact of the launch of iPhone 11.\n",
            "[00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:57,960]  I'm wondering how does it impact,\n",
            "[00:24:57,960 --> 00:25:04,960]  what do you see the impact of that launch on your service revenue bundling effect?\n",
            "[00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:15,330]  Okay, so the iPhone has done very well, the iPhone 11.\n",
            "[00:25:15,330 --> 00:25:19,330]  So, it definitely helped us with the service,\n",
            "[00:25:19,330 --> 00:25:23,330]  the number of subscribers that we were able to add or renew.\n",
            "[00:25:23,330 --> 00:25:25,330]  So, it was all very positive.\n",
            "[00:25:25,330 --> 00:25:29,550]  And then also from a subsidy perspective,\n",
            "[00:25:29,550 --> 00:25:34,550]  this time it wasn't cut really deep because of our competitors.\n",
            "[00:25:34,550 --> 00:25:41,550]  So, I think it was a pretty healthy promotion, and it has done very well.\n",
            "[00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:51,640]  Now, please press 01 on your keypad if you would like to ask a question.\n",
            "[00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:57,340]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:25:57,340 --> 00:26:00,340]  Ladies and gentlemen, if you would like to ask a question,\n",
            "[00:26:00,340 --> 00:26:03,340]  please press 01 on your telephone keypad.\n",
            "[00:26:03,340 --> 00:26:08,410]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:26:08,410 --> 00:26:11,410]  And the next one is coming from Amber Lee of Yuanda.\n",
            "[00:26:11,410 --> 00:26:15,000]  Go ahead, please.\n",
            "[00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:18,000]  I just want to follow up on the CapEx question.\n",
            "[00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:23,000]  Last quarter, I think we didn't really have a lot of color on the CapEx outlook.\n",
            "[00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:24,000]  How about now?\n",
            "[00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:28,000]  Do we have more visibility on CapEx for next year or going forward,\n",
            "[00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:33,000]  especially regarding the investment of 5G infrastructure?\n",
            "[00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:36,270]  Yeah.\n",
            "[00:26:36,270 --> 00:26:41,270]  So, if you're asking if we will disclose more of that information in our next call,\n",
            "[00:26:41,270 --> 00:26:43,270]  I think, yeah, if you request.\n",
            "[00:26:43,270 --> 00:26:49,270]  Because, of course, 5G is going to, you know, a major CapEx driver.\n",
            "[00:26:49,270 --> 00:26:52,270]  So, we certainly will be happy to share that.\n",
            "[00:26:52,270 --> 00:27:00,420]  And this year is more like a business as usual, you know,\n",
            "[00:27:00,420 --> 00:27:03,420]  just plus some TPKC construction, right?\n",
            "[00:27:03,420 --> 00:27:06,420]  But then next year, yeah, sure, certainly.\n",
            "[00:27:06,420 --> 00:27:20,860]  Now, please press 01 on your telephone keypad if you would like to ask a question.\n",

            "[00:27:31,860 --> 00:27:36,590]  There are currently no questions, and I'll pass the call back to Mr. Gary Lai.\n",
            "[00:27:36,590 --> 00:27:38,590]  Gary, please proceed.\n",
            "[00:27:38,590 --> 00:27:43,820]  So, thank you, everybody, again, to attend our quarterly conference call.\n",

            "[00:00:24,870 --> 00:00:32,900]  Please visit www.fareastone.com.tw under the Investor Relations section.\n",
            "[00:00:32,900 --> 00:00:36,900]  And now, I would like to introduce Mr. Gary Lai, the IR Officer.\n",
            "[00:00:36,900 --> 00:00:38,900]  And, Gary, please begin.\n",
            "[00:00:38,900 --> 00:00:45,190]  Good afternoon, everyone, to attend Far Eastone's Second Quarter 2019 Results Conference Call.\n",
            "[00:00:45,190 --> 00:00:51,190]  Both our President, Chi, and CFO, Sherman, are here with us today.\n",
            "[00:00:51,190 --> 00:01:01,190]  Before I start Chi's presentation, please pay attention to the safe harbor statement at the first disclaimer page.\n",
            "[00:01:01,190 --> 00:01:03,190]  Let me turn to Chi, please.\n",
            "[00:01:03,190 --> 00:01:05,670]  Thank you, Gary.\n",
            "[00:01:05,670 --> 00:01:06,670]  Good afternoon, everyone.\n",
            "[00:01:06,670 --> 00:01:10,700]  Thank you for joining us for the Second Quarter Performance Update.\n",
            "[00:01:10,700 --> 00:01:15,700]  I'd like to start with the Taiwan telecom market situation.\n",
            "[00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:20,700]  And I think it is not a great news, but definitely a positive news\n",
            "[00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:23,700]  because the revenue decline is slowing down.\n",
            "[00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:27,700]  As you can see on the left-hand side, the market mobile revenue,\n",
            "[00:01:27,700 --> 00:01:34,730]  if we compare the first half to the second half last year, it was a 9.5% decrease.\n",
            "[00:01:34,730 --> 00:01:41,730]  But then from the second half last year to the first half this year, we are looking at a 3.4% decrease.\n",
            "[00:01:41,730 --> 00:01:44,730]  So the declining is slowing down.\n",
            "[00:01:44,730 --> 00:01:48,730]  And then on the right-hand side, it's indicating the churning of the market, right,\n",
            "[00:01:48,730 --> 00:01:55,730]  in terms of the number of portability and how many subscribers are moving around amount operators.\n",
            "[00:01:55,730 --> 00:01:59,730]  So if you look at from first half last year to second half last year,\n",
            "[00:01:59,730 --> 00:02:05,730]  we are looking at 3.6, 3.7 million subscribers moving around.\n",
            "[00:02:05,730 --> 00:02:13,730]  And to this first half, we are looking at like less than half of it, which is 1.6 million or so.\n",
            "[00:02:13,730 --> 00:02:16,730]  So the market, the churning, is slowing down.\n",
            "[00:02:16,730 --> 00:02:22,730]  But it's also encouraging because even though the price war seems to still be happening,\n",
            "[00:02:22,730 --> 00:02:26,730]  but then the consumers' reaction to those low price\n",
            "[00:02:26,730 --> 00:02:30,730]  and are definitely not as aggressive as they were\n",
            "[00:02:30,730 --> 00:02:36,730]  or they were just not as attracted to these low price offerings like they were before.\n",
            "[00:02:36,730 --> 00:02:37,730]  Okay.\n",
            "[00:02:37,730 --> 00:02:44,730]  And then now turning the focus to Far Eastern ourselves, in terms of our operational performance,\n",
            "[00:02:44,730 --> 00:02:50,730]  on the post-pay customers, even though last year we kind of anticipated number may be declining,\n",
            "[00:02:50,730 --> 00:02:58,940]  but then as you can see from the chart that our post-pay number of customers trained.\n",
            "[00:02:58,940 --> 00:03:10,000]  So we are very pleased to report we are beating our forecast by more than 80,000 subscribers.\n",
            "[00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,000]  And then on the right-hand side, the churn rate,\n",
            "[00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:19,000]  we have continued to manage the churn rate very, very well with our big data and AI analytics.\n",
            "[00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:28,000]  So every quarter we just kept hitting the all-time low as such that we are now at a 1.4%.\n",
            "[00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000]  Okay.\n",
            "[00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,730]  All right.\n",
            "[00:03:30,730 --> 00:03:35,730]  And in terms of our new economy growth areas, in the cloud service revenue,\n",
            "[00:03:35,730 --> 00:03:42,730]  we are looking at more than 600% increase year over year for the first half.\n",
            "[00:03:42,730 --> 00:03:43,830]  Okay.\n",
            "[00:03:43,830 --> 00:03:44,830]  For the second quarter.\n",
            "[00:03:44,830 --> 00:03:50,830]  And then for the IOT revenue, we are also looking at more than 500% increase.\n",
            "[00:03:50,830 --> 00:03:58,920]  And then for the ICT contract amount, and then again, this contract or how many contracts we have earned,\n",
            "[00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:02,920]  but then this is not the same as how much revenue that has been realized.\n",
            "[00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:04,920]  But then just look at a contract amount.\n",
            "[00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:07,920]  We are looking at almost 500% growth as well.\n",
            "[00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:10,920]  So the momentum is just very encouraging.\n",
            "[00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:16,080]  And then on the digital service side, the revenue has gone up 18%,\n",
            "[00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:19,080]  and we are not extremely happy about it.\n",
            "[00:04:19,080 --> 00:04:24,080]  And this is one area we will continue to boost the revenue in this area.\n",
            "[00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:25,120]  Okay.\n",
            "[00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:32,120]  If we compare ourselves with our competitors, the two major ones,\n",
            "[00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:39,120]  and for the second quarter, right, only FET has beaten both top-line and bottom-line guidance.\n",
            "[00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:44,120]  So if you look at Chunghwa, their achievement rate is under 100%,\n",
            "[00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:49,120]  and while Taiwan Mobile achieved one and overachieved the other one,\n",
            "[00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:51,120]  and one is underachieving actually.\n",
            "[00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:57,120]  And Far Eastone has overachieved in both EPS and the total revenue.\n",
            "[00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:05,070]  In the next section, I'm going to ask Sherman, our CFO, to speak in detail for everyone.\n",
            "[00:05:05,070 --> 00:05:06,070]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:05:06,070 --> 00:05:07,070]  Okay.\n",
            "[00:05:07,070 --> 00:05:08,070]  Hi, everyone.\n",
            "[00:05:08,070 --> 00:05:11,070]  So now we are on page nine.\n",
            "[00:05:11,070 --> 00:05:15,070]  Let's first look at EBITDA and margin.\n",
            "[00:05:15,070 --> 00:05:24,070]  Let me remind you that the EBITDA on 2019 is IFRS 16, so it looks higher than 2018.\n",
            "[00:05:24,070 --> 00:05:29,070]  But actually, if we use Apple to Apple, let's use pre-IFRS 16,\n",
            "[00:05:29,070 --> 00:05:35,070]  then we will see that our margin ratio on second quarter actually is 31.8%,\n",
            "[00:05:35,070 --> 00:05:42,070]  which is largely in line with what happened in 2018 first quarter.\n",
            "[00:05:42,070 --> 00:05:51,320]  And then the net income for 2019 second quarter is $2.174 billion.\n",
            "[00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:52,320]  Next page.\n",
            "[00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:57,350]  And then you can see that on the total revenue side,\n",
            "[00:05:57,350 --> 00:06:06,350]  the second quarter result is $24.425 billion, which is 102% of guidance.\n",
            "[00:06:06,350 --> 00:06:13,700]  And operating expense is $3.68 billion, which is 96% of guidance.\n",
            "[00:06:13,700 --> 00:06:16,700]  And EBITDA is 103% of guidance.\n",
            "[00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:24,000]  And then net income is 2.175% of guidance.\n",
            "[00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:29,000]  And the EPS for second quarter is $0.67 per share.\n",
            "[00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:32,000]  That is $0.03 higher than the guidance.\n",
            "[00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:42,000]  So for the first half of 2019, the total EPS achievement is $1.35,\n",
            "[00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,000]  which is also 5% higher than the guidance.\n",
            "[00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:54,470]  And it is also 52% of annual guidance, which is $2.60.\n",
            "[00:06:54,470 --> 00:07:00,330]  And then the financial result right now at the end of second quarter,\n",
            "[00:07:00,330 --> 00:07:04,330]  the cash on hand is $12.7 billion.\n",
            "[00:07:04,330 --> 00:07:11,810]  And the total net debt is $19.145 billion.\n",
            "[00:07:11,810 --> 00:07:16,810]  The shareholder's equity is $66.18 billion.\n",
            "[00:07:16,810 --> 00:07:23,840]  And the net debt is a healthy 0.74 times of EBITDA.\n",
            "[00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:33,480]  And the free cash flow of second quarter year-to-date is $5.2 billion.\n",
            "[00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:38,940]  The major reason is it didn't increase as much.\n",
            "[00:07:38,940 --> 00:07:52,050]  We have a significant payout, and as well as we return time mobile $0.9 billion\n",
            "[00:07:52,050 --> 00:07:54,050]  for legal dispute.\n",
            "[00:07:54,050 --> 00:08:02,490]  And because of that, so the second quarter cash is as high as the first quarter.\n",
            "[00:08:02,490 --> 00:08:14,650]  And we also spend $3.197 billion basically in network equipment procurement.\n",
            "[00:08:14,650 --> 00:08:20,460]  And that concludes my presentation.\n",
            "[00:08:20,460 --> 00:08:21,460]  All right.\n",
            "[00:08:21,460 --> 00:08:22,750]  Thank you, Sherman.\n",
            "[00:08:22,750 --> 00:08:23,750]  Okay.\n",
            "[00:08:23,750 --> 00:08:25,750]  If you turn to slide 13.\n",
            "[00:08:25,750 --> 00:08:26,750]  Okay.\n",
            "[00:08:26,750 --> 00:08:31,750]  Just a quick summary of our second quarter highlights for Far East Zone.\n",
            "[00:08:31,750 --> 00:08:36,750]  In terms of 5G readiness, and everybody probably already knows that we're going\n",
            "[00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:39,750]  to have the auctions on December 9th.\n",
            "[00:08:39,750 --> 00:08:43,750]  And then so we continue to be prepared for 5G.\n",
            "[00:08:43,750 --> 00:08:48,750]  And then we have been doing quite a bit of lab testing.\n",
            "[00:08:48,750 --> 00:08:52,750]  And then we also have completed 5G Life EPC trial.\n",
            "[00:08:52,750 --> 00:09:00,360]  And also we have completed the first packet switching call using 5G RAN.\n",
            "[00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:05,360]  On the software development part, which is one of the major focus areas since I joined\n",
            "[00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:11,360]  the FET, that is to strengthen, continue to build our software development capabilities\n",
            "[00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:12,360]  and team.\n",
            "[00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:16,360]  And then, you know, in our transformation office, we actually have launched the IOT\n",
            "[00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:19,360]  platform for enablement of applications.\n",
            "[00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:25,360]  And that is internally built, and it's already available for commercial use.\n",
            "[00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:31,030]  And then we've been in touch with our enterprise customers for the usage of it.\n",
            "[00:09:31,030 --> 00:09:35,030]  In the channel transformation, especially the digital transformation, we want to continue\n",
            "[00:09:35,030 --> 00:09:40,030]  to enhance our user experience, the digital user experience.\n",
            "[00:09:40,030 --> 00:09:43,030]  That includes how they will shop online and pick up offline.\n",
            "[00:09:43,030 --> 00:09:49,030]  And then also, you know, across different touch points across all channels, how we can\n",
            "[00:09:49,030 --> 00:09:51,030]  connect that together.\n",
            "[00:09:51,030 --> 00:09:54,030]  And this is an ongoing one-channel initiative.\n",
            "[00:09:54,030 --> 00:09:59,030]  That is one of the major initiatives we are undergoing in Far Eastern.\n",
            "[00:09:59,030 --> 00:10:07,030]  And also we have provided a real-time self-performance dashboard to our stores and the self-managers\n",
            "[00:10:07,030 --> 00:10:08,030]  as well.\n",
            "[00:10:08,030 --> 00:10:12,120]  And in the past it's not as real-time, but it's now real-time.\n",
            "[00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:18,120]  And then also in the growing ICT business area, the two recent wins that we have got,\n",
            "[00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:22,120]  one is Italian City Smart Street Link.\n",
            "[00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:26,120]  That is $2.4 billion worth of a contract that we have acquired.\n",
            "[00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:33,120]  And then also the other one of the significant wins that we got is Taipei Metro Station Monitoring\n",
            "[00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:38,480]  System, which is $142 million contract.\n",
            "[00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:42,480]  And then we also got many awards and recognitions.\n",
            "[00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:47,480]  Just to name a few, we listed four here that included we are one of the top five listed\n",
            "[00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:50,480]  companies for corporate governance evaluation.\n",
            "[00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:53,480]  And this was held by Taiwan Stock Exchange.\n",
            "[00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:57,480]  And this is our getting this award for five years in a row.\n",
            "[00:10:57,480 --> 00:11:04,570]  And also we got the best CSR award from Global Views Monthly for three years in a row.\n",
            "[00:11:04,570 --> 00:11:07,570]  And then we also earned the best service in Taiwan.\n",
            "[00:11:07,570 --> 00:11:10,570]  This is across all categories, not just telecom.\n",
            "[00:11:10,570 --> 00:11:12,570]  And that is eight years in a row.\n",
            "[00:11:13,570 --> 00:11:20,570]  And then all these is just indicating our consistently performing best service\n",
            "[00:11:20,570 --> 00:11:24,570]  and then doing our CSR responsibilities for the community.\n",
            "[00:11:24,570 --> 00:11:29,570]  And that is just, you know, part of our mission for Eastone.\n",
            "[00:11:29,570 --> 00:11:33,570]  And also we continue to work with our employees.\n",
            "[00:11:33,570 --> 00:11:39,570]  You know, we work on the open communications and then engagement of the employees.\n",
            "[00:11:39,570 --> 00:11:46,570]  And then so we are also recognized as the best companies to work for by two of the institutes.\n",
            "[00:11:46,570 --> 00:11:47,570]  Okay.\n",
            "[00:11:47,570 --> 00:11:54,800]  And then as far as the second half focus is concerned, and, of course, as I mentioned,\n",
            "[00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:56,800]  5G is on everybody's mind.\n",
            "[00:11:56,800 --> 00:12:01,800]  And that is definitely one of the major areas that we are focusing on.\n",
            "[00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:07,800]  And that is in terms of the auction strategy and our business plan across the years.\n",
            "[00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:13,800]  And also, you know, we will need to do that natural upgrade, which is already ongoing.\n",
            "[00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:14,890]  Okay.\n",
            "[00:12:14,890 --> 00:12:18,890]  And we'll continue to accelerate our digital service growth\n",
            "[00:12:18,890 --> 00:12:22,890]  and to improve our customer digital experience.\n",
            "[00:12:22,890 --> 00:12:27,890]  And also, even though our ICT is showing a great momentum in growing,\n",
            "[00:12:27,890 --> 00:12:30,890]  and we will continue to do it and continue to grow it.\n",
            "[00:12:31,890 --> 00:12:36,890]  And also, one of the major advantages we have at Far Eastone,\n",
            "[00:12:36,890 --> 00:12:40,890]  being one part of the Far Eastern group, the conglomerate,\n",
            "[00:12:40,890 --> 00:12:48,890]  that we want to speed up our synergy with the Far Eastern companies that we have identified.\n",
            "[00:12:48,890 --> 00:12:49,890]  Okay.\n",
            "[00:12:49,890 --> 00:12:55,890]  And then we'll continue to drive down our operation costs and optimize our capital investment,\n",
            "[00:12:55,890 --> 00:13:03,890]  utilizing agile, big data, and AI as our enablers to improve our capability in this area.\n",
            "[00:13:03,890 --> 00:13:08,890]  And also, we'll continue to develop our employees' core capabilities,\n",
            "[00:13:08,890 --> 00:13:15,890]  and then as that is what we consider our core capabilities for us to continue to grow with the new technology.\n",
            "[00:13:15,890 --> 00:13:20,890]  With that, and I will conclude my presentation, and I'll welcome questions.\n",
            "[00:13:20,890 --> 00:13:23,270]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:13:23,270 --> 00:13:27,270]  And ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin our question-and-answer session.\n",
            "[00:13:27,270 --> 00:13:33,270]  If you have a question for any of today's speakers, please press 01 on your telephone keypad,\n",
            "[00:13:33,270 --> 00:13:35,300]  and you will enter the queue.\n",
            "[00:13:35,300 --> 00:13:39,330]  After you are announced, please ask your question.\n",
            "[00:13:39,330 --> 00:13:43,330]  If you find that your question has been answered before it is your turn to speak,\n",
            "[00:13:43,330 --> 00:13:46,330]  please press 02 to cancel the question.\n",
            "[00:13:46,330 --> 00:13:52,480]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:56,480]  And the first question is coming from Neil Anderson of HSBC.\n",
            "[00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:57,480]  Go ahead, please.\n",
            "[00:13:57,480 --> 00:13:59,410]  Hi.\n",
            "[00:13:59,410 --> 00:14:00,410]  Good afternoon.\n",
            "[00:14:00,410 --> 00:14:01,410]  Two questions, please.\n",
            "[00:14:01,410 --> 00:14:05,410]  The first one relates to slide four on the chart on the market MFP customers.\n",
            "[00:14:05,410 --> 00:14:07,410]  It's such a dramatic reduction.\n",
            "[00:14:07,410 --> 00:14:11,410]  I wondered if you could explain what you think has changed this year.\n",
            "[00:14:11,410 --> 00:14:14,410]  Obviously, we have 499 in May of last year.\n",
            "[00:14:14,410 --> 00:14:18,410]  Is that the main factor, or are there others there?\n",
            "[00:14:18,410 --> 00:14:22,410]  The second question relates to the ICT contract growth,\n",
            "[00:14:23,410 --> 00:14:28,410]  and what I'd imagine is that each of the big three telcos has a particular focus\n",
            "[00:14:28,410 --> 00:14:32,410]  in terms of verticals or enterprise customers,\n",
            "[00:14:32,410 --> 00:14:38,410]  and I wondered if you could discuss a little bit about what you feel Far Eastern strength is in the ICT space.\n",
            "[00:14:38,410 --> 00:14:39,410]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:14:39,410 --> 00:14:41,530]  Okay.\n",
            "[00:14:41,530 --> 00:14:43,530]  Thank you for your question.\n",
            "[00:14:43,530 --> 00:14:51,530]  So for the first one, why this MNP, mobile number portability, has decreased so much.\n",
            "[00:14:51,530 --> 00:14:57,530]  Well, I think the anxiety and the fever, you know, that came with 499.\n",
            "[00:14:57,530 --> 00:15:00,530]  Certainly over time it died down a little bit.\n",
            "[00:15:00,530 --> 00:15:10,530]  But as far as Far Eastern is concerned, we were very ‚Äì we used a lot of big data analytics, right,\n",
            "[00:15:10,530 --> 00:15:13,530]  and predict the churns and all that.\n",
            "[00:15:13,530 --> 00:15:21,630]  And then I think our campaign and watching how our competitors react to the market\n",
            "[00:15:21,630 --> 00:15:25,630]  or they initiate some campaigns and how we respond.\n",
            "[00:15:25,630 --> 00:15:32,630]  You know, the three bigger telcos, in this case, I think we all kind of have learned, right?\n",
            "[00:15:32,630 --> 00:15:37,630]  Last year, with the 499, everybody was rushing into a price war,\n",
            "[00:15:37,630 --> 00:15:40,630]  and I think everybody now thinks clearer as well.\n",
            "[00:15:40,630 --> 00:15:41,630]  So I think that helped, too.\n",
            "[00:15:41,630 --> 00:15:47,630]  So even though we still see some price cuts here and there, but then they're all kind of like small ones\n",
            "[00:15:47,630 --> 00:15:50,630]  and then nothing major like last year.\n",
            "[00:15:50,630 --> 00:15:55,630]  So I think that also contributes to the stabilizing of the market.\n",
            "[00:15:55,630 --> 00:16:00,630]  That is really all I could say at this point, but then I think that's a very good question.\n",
            "[00:16:00,630 --> 00:16:04,630]  Maybe, you know, when we go back we can ask our big data team, too,\n",
            "[00:16:04,630 --> 00:16:12,160]  if there's any other reason for that that I didn't see.\n",
            "[00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:19,160]  Yeah, another reason is a lot of customers just lock in 499 or a similar contract.\n",
            "[00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:24,160]  So in the past three quarters, so right now a lot of customers are in contracts,\n",
            "[00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:27,030]  so the churns become very low.\n",
            "[00:16:27,030 --> 00:16:28,030]  That's true.\n",
            "[00:16:28,030 --> 00:16:34,030]  So right after 499 at that time, right, because the rate has been slashed so much,\n",
            "[00:16:34,030 --> 00:16:38,030]  so even with penalty, you know, people would move, right, would break the lease\n",
            "[00:16:38,030 --> 00:16:41,030]  and then pay the penalty, and it was still worth it.\n",
            "[00:16:41,030 --> 00:16:47,030]  But then once they do that, they are locked in for 24 months or, you know, 30 months even.\n",
            "[00:16:47,030 --> 00:16:51,570]  So that helped as well, yes, definitely.\n",
            "[00:16:51,570 --> 00:16:54,330]  Okay.\n",
            "[00:16:54,330 --> 00:16:58,330]  The second question is in the IT area, if I remember.\n",
            "[00:16:58,330 --> 00:17:06,330]  Yeah, so I would have to say, you know, because of its special incumbent kind of nature,\n",
            "[00:17:06,330 --> 00:17:09,330]  it started as being government-owned,\n",
            "[00:17:10,330 --> 00:17:16,330]  so they have been always kind of having the advantage in the government and industry side.\n",
            "[00:17:16,330 --> 00:17:19,330]  So they have been always doing pretty well.\n",
            "[00:17:19,330 --> 00:17:23,330]  I don't think Taiwan Mobile is doing as well in this area,\n",
            "[00:17:23,330 --> 00:17:31,330]  and I think Far Eastone definitely is closely approaching where Chunhua is.\n",
            "[00:17:31,330 --> 00:17:33,330]  Well, definitely that's our goal.\n",
            "[00:17:33,330 --> 00:17:43,330]  So, you know, for example, in the smart city, smart, you know, factory areas, right, in the IoT area,\n",
            "[00:17:43,330 --> 00:17:52,330]  even though in the past the government contracts usually are pretty much predominantly awarded to Chunhua,\n",
            "[00:17:52,330 --> 00:17:55,330]  but then we are already breaking into that,\n",
            "[00:17:55,330 --> 00:18:00,330]  and then we have been getting quite a few wins and then where we beat Chunhua.\n",
            "[00:18:00,330 --> 00:18:06,330]  So I definitely see our momentum in the IoT area that drives a lot of this.\n",
            "[00:18:06,330 --> 00:18:09,330]  And also another area is our cloud.\n",
            "[00:18:09,330 --> 00:18:14,330]  We are doing very well in cloud, and I think we even topped Chunhua in this, right.\n",
            "[00:18:14,330 --> 00:18:24,330]  We have like 280 certified employees that are qualified to work on cloud or to provide cloud services,\n",
            "[00:18:25,330 --> 00:18:29,330]  and Far Eastone is even awarded, you know, one of the four,\n",
            "[00:18:29,330 --> 00:18:35,330]  I think only four globally managed service providers for AWS.\n",
            "[00:18:35,330 --> 00:18:40,560]  So that tells you how strong we are in terms of providing the cloud service,\n",
            "[00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:47,950]  which is definitely a driving force in our growth.\n",
            "[00:18:47,950 --> 00:18:48,950]  Thank you very much.\n",
            "[00:18:48,950 --> 00:18:49,980]  Sure.\n",
            "[00:18:49,980 --> 00:18:57,340]  And the next one is from Billy Lee of Credit Suisse.\n",
            "[00:18:57,340 --> 00:18:58,880]  Go ahead, please.\n",
            "[00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:00,880]  Thank you for the opportunity.\n",
            "[00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:02,880]  I have two questions here.\n",
            "[00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:09,880]  The first question is you mentioned the passion for the 499 plan,\n",
            "[00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:14,880]  or in general the lower price point has died out a little bit.\n",
            "[00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:20,880]  If possible, would you be able to disclose the number of people on the network there on the 499 plan\n",
            "[00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:24,880]  in terms of the proportion of subscribers as of now?\n",
            "[00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:32,880]  And then the second question is, yeah, I also noticed on new economy side of business,\n",
            "[00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:37,880]  like the IoT and cloud side, they are showing very strong momentum.\n",
            "[00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:44,880]  Could you remind us what's the revenue amount from these revenues?\n",
            "[00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:50,880]  And also, could you also remind us where is it booked in terms of the revenue line?\n",
            "[00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:53,880]  Is it on the equipment and other revenue?\n",
            "[00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:55,040]  That's my question.\n",
            "[00:19:55,040 --> 00:20:03,990]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:20:03,990 --> 00:20:04,990]  Okay.\n",
            "[00:20:04,990 --> 00:20:05,990]  So, I'm sorry.\n",
            "[00:20:05,990 --> 00:20:08,990]  Your second question, you were in and out.\n",
            "[00:20:08,990 --> 00:20:09,990]  Your voice was low.\n",
            "[00:20:09,990 --> 00:20:11,990]  So, I think you were asking about ICT.\n",
            "[00:20:11,990 --> 00:20:16,990]  Were you asking about specifically in which areas we are doing very well?\n",
            "[00:20:16,990 --> 00:20:19,990]  Was that the question?\n",
            "[00:20:19,990 --> 00:20:20,990]  Sorry.\n",
            "[00:20:20,990 --> 00:20:27,150]  I mean, in general, the new economy, including ICT and cloud,\n",
            "[00:20:27,150 --> 00:20:29,150]  so everything excluding the mobile part.\n",
            "[00:20:29,150 --> 00:20:31,010]  Yes.\n",
            "[00:20:31,010 --> 00:20:32,010]  Right.\n",
            "[00:20:32,010 --> 00:20:36,010]  So, let me answer your second question first since we are on it.\n",
            "[00:20:36,010 --> 00:20:41,010]  So, there are really three major areas in terms of the ICT, right?\n",
            "[00:20:41,010 --> 00:20:50,010]  One is cloud, and we definitely see almost like four times the growth in the ICT area,\n",
            "[00:20:50,010 --> 00:20:54,010]  in the cloud area, and then the second area is in the security, right?\n",
            "[00:20:54,010 --> 00:21:00,010]  And then the third area is in IoT, although IoT is relatively smaller in terms of the revenue,\n",
            "[00:21:00,010 --> 00:21:03,010]  but it is definitely a new blue ocean.\n",
            "[00:21:03,010 --> 00:21:10,010]  And then I think the Taiwan market is awakening to this new technology, the IoT.\n",
            "[00:21:10,010 --> 00:21:15,010]  And then we also see with 5G that there will be more AIoT,\n",
            "[00:21:15,010 --> 00:21:18,010]  artificial intelligence IoT opportunities.\n",
            "[00:21:18,010 --> 00:21:22,010]  So, that is in the ICT or the new economy.\n",
            "[00:21:22,010 --> 00:21:28,010]  And also, if you look at the digital services, that's more on the consumer side.\n",
            "[00:21:28,010 --> 00:21:34,010]  But then I see the stronger momentum on the enterprise side with this ICT growth.\n",
            "[00:21:34,010 --> 00:21:35,170]  Okay.\n",
            "[00:21:35,170 --> 00:21:37,170]  I hope that answers your second question.\n",
            "[00:21:37,170 --> 00:21:38,170]  Sorry.\n",
            "[00:21:38,170 --> 00:21:43,170]  Do you have the number of the revenue figure for this business?\n",
            "[00:21:43,170 --> 00:21:48,520]  Well, you know, I personally buy that later on.\n",
            "[00:21:48,520 --> 00:21:51,520]  I don't have them offhand here, but then we certainly have breakdown.\n",
            "[00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:53,520]  That's how we can add up the revenue.\n",
            "[00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:55,520]  We can provide to you offline.\n",
            "[00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:56,520]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:21:56,520 --> 00:21:57,520]  Okay.\n",
            "[00:21:57,520 --> 00:21:58,610]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:21:58,610 --> 00:22:01,610]  For 499, I don't have the number here, but I can give you a reference.\n",
            "[00:22:01,610 --> 00:22:10,610]  499 is a SIM-only rep plan, and we only have 25% SIM-only customers,\n",
            "[00:22:10,610 --> 00:22:13,610]  and not all of them are 499.\n",
            "[00:22:13,610 --> 00:22:16,610]  So, the 499 should be much lower than 25%.\n",
            "[00:22:16,610 --> 00:22:17,840]  Right.\n",
            "[00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:25,840]  Just to clarify a little bit, right, in case folks are not as familiar with our telecom, you know, jargon.\n",
            "[00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:31,840]  So, you know, when we offer ‚Äì when people would pick 499, right, as the plan,\n",
            "[00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:34,840]  usually they come already with their device.\n",
            "[00:22:34,840 --> 00:22:36,840]  So, we call this SIM-only.\n",
            "[00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:39,840]  They only come for a SIM card, and then they get ‚Äì you know,\n",
            "[00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:42,840]  they pay 499 for no data usage limit, right?\n",
            "[00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:47,840]  But then we still have a lot of customers because we do offer, you know,\n",
            "[00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:53,840]  nice discounts on our devices, and then we have a variety of very high-end phones.\n",
            "[00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:54,840]  We still have a lot of customers.\n",
            "[00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:56,840]  They are loaning for that.\n",
            "[00:22:56,840 --> 00:23:00,840]  So, you know, the 499 is really just for SIM-only,\n",
            "[00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:04,840]  which accounts for about 25% of our post-pay profile.\n",
            "[00:23:04,840 --> 00:23:09,840]  And then the others, we still have a higher, you know, monthly fee for those that come,\n",
            "[00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:11,840]  you know, they get a bundled offer.\n",
            "[00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:13,840]  So, that's not just a SIM-only.\n",
            "[00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:19,840]  They will get device or other kind of, you know, house appliances, you know.\n",
            "[00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:22,840]  So, it's more than just a mobile device.\n",
            "[00:23:22,840 --> 00:23:23,840]  They can get other things as well.\n",
            "[00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:27,840]  That's through our variety we offer in our bundled program.\n",
            "[00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:30,960]  I hope that answers your question, sir.\n",
            "[00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:31,960]  That's very clear.\n",
            "[00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:32,960]  Thanks.\n",
            "[00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:34,440]  Sure.\n",
            "[00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:41,800]  And next, we'll have Danny Chu from Bank of America for questions.\n",
            "[00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:42,800]  Go ahead, please.\n",
            "[00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:43,800]  Hi.\n",
            "[00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:46,470]  Thanks for taking my questions.\n",
            "[00:23:46,470 --> 00:23:48,470]  Just two quick questions.\n",
            "[00:23:48,470 --> 00:23:56,470]  First, with regards to 5G, can I ask the management from a strategic standpoint,\n",
            "[00:23:57,470 --> 00:24:02,470]  down the road, if you have to so-called make a guesstimate,\n",
            "[00:24:02,470 --> 00:24:09,470]  roughly how much or percentage of the 5G revenue you expect coming from the consumer side\n",
            "[00:24:09,470 --> 00:24:15,470]  versus the 5G revenue coming from the enterprise, the corporate or the industrial customers,\n",
            "[00:24:15,470 --> 00:24:22,470]  which segment do you think will contribute a much bigger segment of the 5G revenue?\n",
            "[00:24:22,470 --> 00:24:24,470]  That would be my first question.\n",
            "[00:24:24,470 --> 00:24:29,470]  And then, the second question is actually related to the first one.\n",
            "[00:24:29,470 --> 00:24:35,470]  I'm sure the management is doing a lot of customer due diligence work on 5G.\n",
            "[00:24:35,470 --> 00:24:39,470]  Based on the preliminary studies so far,\n",
            "[00:24:39,470 --> 00:24:45,470]  among the initial services that you're going to launch with your 5G network,\n",
            "[00:24:45,470 --> 00:24:50,470]  which particular service do you think will be very popular with the consumers?\n",
            "[00:24:50,470 --> 00:24:55,720]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:24:55,720 --> 00:24:56,720]  Okay.\n",
            "[00:24:56,720 --> 00:25:04,720]  To answer your first question about, like, the 5G revenue breakdown between consumer and enterprise,\n",
            "[00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:10,720]  I don't really need a wild guess, you know, because I could use what we have now with 4G, right?\n",
            "[00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:19,720]  So today, for Far East Zone, the consumer side of revenue accounts for more than 80 percent,\n",
            "[00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:24,720]  and then about 17 percent is enterprise.\n",
            "[00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:31,720]  And I would say for 5G, that would be something we can start with or look for,\n",
            "[00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:36,720]  so nothing too wild or deviate from that.\n",
            "[00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:40,910]  We are looking at consumer, right, being a bigger volume.\n",
            "[00:25:40,910 --> 00:25:47,910]  However, given 5G is new, and then this is now, like, 5G replacing 4G,\n",
            "[00:25:47,910 --> 00:25:51,910]  so the adoption of 5G, it will take time, right?\n",
            "[00:25:51,910 --> 00:25:55,910]  So even for, like, South Korea, like, in the first three months,\n",
            "[00:25:55,910 --> 00:25:59,910]  and the whole government is proactively advocating for 5G,\n",
            "[00:25:59,910 --> 00:26:04,910]  and then the amount of the three telcos there that combine,\n",
            "[00:26:04,910 --> 00:26:09,910]  they just have got, like, 1.4 million subscribers.\n",
            "[00:26:09,910 --> 00:26:12,910]  So the number at the beginning will be small.\n",
            "[00:26:12,910 --> 00:26:18,910]  But then on the enterprise side, right, so this is, like, 5G, you know,\n",
            "[00:26:18,910 --> 00:26:21,910]  a lot of the IOT, like I mentioned, already we are doing it,\n",
            "[00:26:21,910 --> 00:26:27,910]  and that is doing it with 4G technology, like MBIOT, right, or LTEM.\n",
            "[00:26:27,910 --> 00:26:29,910]  So 4G already can do that.\n",
            "[00:26:29,910 --> 00:26:38,910]  And then if you need to, you really need to find those really advanced enterprise clients\n",
            "[00:26:38,910 --> 00:26:41,910]  or, you know, big factories that they may have special needs,\n",
            "[00:26:41,910 --> 00:26:46,910]  like even, like, private networks, or they need us to do some network slicing,\n",
            "[00:26:46,910 --> 00:26:51,910]  or they have some automation, you know, like using AIOT.\n",
            "[00:26:51,910 --> 00:26:58,910]  And actually, as a matter of fact, in one of our ‚Äì a couple of our Far Eastern groups\n",
            "[00:26:58,910 --> 00:27:02,910]  that we have already done POC on AIOT.\n",
            "[00:27:02,910 --> 00:27:06,910]  So there we see the application for doing 5G.\n",
            "[00:27:06,910 --> 00:27:11,910]  So to tell you from our region, the AT20 kind of thing from 4G,\n",
            "[00:27:11,910 --> 00:27:16,910]  now given 5G is not replacing 4G, but then kind of an add-on to 4G,\n",
            "[00:27:16,910 --> 00:27:19,910]  so that model would not be how we started with.\n",
            "[00:27:19,910 --> 00:27:23,910]  And I really don't know how to guess it, to be honest.\n",
            "[00:27:23,910 --> 00:27:28,910]  But then I could tell you with 5G being deployed, right,\n",
            "[00:27:28,910 --> 00:27:33,910]  and then we need to be very careful and smart about investment.\n",
            "[00:27:33,910 --> 00:27:39,910]  You were asking, like, what areas, what kind of services we will offer for 5G,\n",
            "[00:27:39,910 --> 00:27:41,910]  you know, on the consumer side.\n",
            "[00:27:41,910 --> 00:27:45,910]  Well, first of all, 5G provides the big bandwidth, right,\n",
            "[00:27:45,910 --> 00:27:48,910]  and then the fast speed and then also low latency.\n",
            "[00:27:48,910 --> 00:27:53,910]  So I think just as a pure enhancement of 4G experience,\n",
            "[00:27:53,910 --> 00:27:57,910]  that consumer that would sign up for 5G, they will get that.\n",
            "[00:27:57,910 --> 00:28:02,910]  And then now if they get the kind of device that would support, you know,\n",
            "[00:28:02,910 --> 00:28:05,910]  like a 4K, 8K kind of resolution,\n",
            "[00:28:05,910 --> 00:28:09,910]  then they certainly get that better entertainment experience as well.\n",
            "[00:28:09,910 --> 00:28:15,910]  So, you know, and then we still have a year or so before the 5G will be launched.\n",
            "[00:28:15,910 --> 00:28:20,910]  And then hopefully, you know, before that, there are some other, you know,\n",
            "[00:28:20,910 --> 00:28:25,910]  killer or killer-like applications that will be already developed.\n",
            "[00:28:25,910 --> 00:28:27,130]  We'll just see.\n",
            "[00:28:27,130 --> 00:28:32,130]  But then I think as Telco, the first thing we provide is connectivity, right,\n",
            "[00:28:32,130 --> 00:28:36,130]  and this is much enhanced connectivity from 5G to 4G.\n",
            "[00:28:36,130 --> 00:28:39,130]  But we are going to look at 4G plus 5G.\n",
            "[00:28:39,130 --> 00:28:42,130]  So I think consumer, even without any new services,\n",
            "[00:28:42,130 --> 00:28:44,130]  just their experience will be enhanced.\n",
            "[00:28:44,130 --> 00:28:50,130]  The question is if we can find some new services or, you know,\n",
            "[00:28:50,130 --> 00:28:55,130]  renewed services that because of the 5G technology that will actually\n",
            "[00:28:55,130 --> 00:28:59,130]  intrigue more users to adopt to 5G quicker,\n",
            "[00:28:59,130 --> 00:29:03,130]  then we can see our adoption rate to, you know, accelerate eventually.\n",
            "[00:29:03,130 --> 00:29:06,130]  But at first, I would say it will take some time,\n",
            "[00:29:06,130 --> 00:29:09,130]  just looking at South Korea as an example.\n",
            "[00:29:09,130 --> 00:29:13,130]  But then just because some of the, you know, countries are ahead of us,\n",
            "[00:29:13,130 --> 00:29:19,130]  so South Korea is nice to watch because by next year when we deploy, you know,\n",
            "[00:29:19,130 --> 00:29:23,130]  South Korea will not be still at 1.5 million.\n",
            "[00:29:24,130 --> 00:29:26,130]  So their success would help, you know,\n",
            "[00:29:26,130 --> 00:29:30,130]  the consumers here in Taiwan to see what 5G can do.\n",
            "[00:29:30,130 --> 00:29:35,130]  So this is one of the advantages not being the first, you know, adapter,\n",
            "[00:29:35,130 --> 00:29:40,130]  you know, so because you can see what others have done.\n",
            "[00:29:40,130 --> 00:29:45,570]  And then that is the advantage of the learning we can get.\n",
            "[00:29:45,570 --> 00:29:48,570]  If I may add a follow-up question.\n",
            "[00:29:48,570 --> 00:29:50,570]  Actually, like I mean,\n",
            "[00:29:50,570 --> 00:29:55,570]  when I looked at what's happened with the 5G service in Korea,\n",
            "[00:29:55,570 --> 00:30:01,570]  I believe the operators recently actually they have stepped up on their\n",
            "[00:30:01,570 --> 00:30:07,570]  handset subsidy just to so-called compete for 5G market share.\n",
            "[00:30:07,570 --> 00:30:11,570]  Are you worried that like when 5G get launched in Taiwan,\n",
            "[00:30:11,570 --> 00:30:17,570]  some of your peers may do the same in terms of offering very heavy\n",
            "[00:30:17,570 --> 00:30:22,570]  handset subsidy on 5G to compete for market share?\n",
            "[00:30:22,570 --> 00:30:27,570]  And if they do that, like I mean, how Firestone is going to respond?\n",
            "[00:30:27,570 --> 00:30:28,570]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:30:28,570 --> 00:30:30,880]  Okay.\n",
            "[00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:33,880]  Do I worry or do I think they will do that?\n",
            "[00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:36,880]  We certainly have seen someone on that like a 499, right?\n",
            "[00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:38,880]  So anything is possible.\n",
            "[00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:40,880]  And then when you have too many telcos,\n",
            "[00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:45,880]  I think the kind of price cut of subsidy is just not inevitable, right?\n",
            "[00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:46,880]  It's inevitable.\n",
            "[00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:55,430]  So I think but then one other thing is when we deploy 5G,\n",
            "[00:30:55,430 --> 00:30:59,430]  and then I believe that the price on the device will be already lower\n",
            "[00:30:59,430 --> 00:31:01,430]  than what it is now, right?\n",
            "[00:31:01,430 --> 00:31:09,430]  And then so hopefully the room for this additional subsidy will be smaller.\n",
            "[00:31:09,430 --> 00:31:13,430]  So even if the telcos want to compete on that,\n",
            "[00:31:13,430 --> 00:31:16,430]  it wouldn't be as harsh impact on the financial.\n",
            "[00:31:16,430 --> 00:31:20,430]  But we have to really do some calculation to see what's the best move\n",
            "[00:31:20,430 --> 00:31:23,430]  and then to react, right?\n",
            "[00:31:23,430 --> 00:31:28,430]  But then hopefully all our telcos, our peer telcos,\n",
            "[00:31:28,430 --> 00:31:34,430]  would all know the right thing to do, not to hurt everybody.\n",
            "[00:31:34,430 --> 00:31:35,430]  Okay.\n",
            "[00:31:35,430 --> 00:31:38,570]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:31:38,570 --> 00:31:39,990]  Sure.\n",
            "[00:31:39,990 --> 00:31:46,130]  As a reminder, please press 01 on your keypad\n",
            "[00:31:46,130 --> 00:31:48,130]  if you would like to ask a question.\n",
            "[00:31:48,130 --> 00:31:50,960]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:53,960]  And the next one is from Amber Lee of Yuanda.\n",
            "[00:31:53,960 --> 00:31:54,960]  Go ahead, please.\n",
            "[00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:56,630]  Hi.\n",
            "[00:31:56,630 --> 00:31:57,630]  I have two here.\n",
            "[00:31:57,630 --> 00:32:00,630]  So I think on the overall handset outlook,\n",
            "[00:32:00,630 --> 00:32:05,630]  recalling that earlier this year you expect a more sluggish performance\n",
            "[00:32:05,630 --> 00:32:10,630]  in terms of your equipment sales this year compared to 2018.\n",
            "[00:32:10,630 --> 00:32:15,630]  But as we approach into the high season of this segment,\n",
            "[00:32:15,630 --> 00:32:20,630]  how should we look at the equipment performance of this year?\n",
            "[00:32:21,850 --> 00:32:22,850]  And that's the first one.\n",
            "[00:32:22,850 --> 00:32:27,850]  And secondly, in terms of the percentage of revenue contribution\n",
            "[00:32:27,850 --> 00:32:32,850]  of your new economic business with the number to be provided later,\n",
            "[00:32:32,850 --> 00:32:37,850]  do you think the contribution will be greater than you previously expected,\n",
            "[00:32:37,850 --> 00:32:40,850]  13%, 14%?\n",
            "[00:32:40,850 --> 00:32:51,070]  Given that growth in the quarter seems to be pretty encouraging.\n",
            "[00:32:51,070 --> 00:32:52,070]  Okay.\n",
            "[00:32:52,070 --> 00:32:53,070]  Thank you for the question.\n",
            "[00:32:53,070 --> 00:32:56,070]  So on the first one, on the device revenue,\n",
            "[00:32:56,070 --> 00:33:01,070]  well I don't have the details that our IR person can provide later,\n",
            "[00:33:01,070 --> 00:33:06,070]  but then I certainly know our iPhone has been in hot sales, right,\n",
            "[00:33:06,070 --> 00:33:11,070]  because I just kept getting the purchase request orders from my team\n",
            "[00:33:11,070 --> 00:33:12,070]  and I had to ask them.\n",
            "[00:33:12,070 --> 00:33:16,070]  But then it has been selling really, really well.\n",
            "[00:33:16,070 --> 00:33:22,290]  And also I think another advantage that I would see is we are\n",
            "[00:33:22,290 --> 00:33:23,290]  partner vendors.\n",
            "[00:33:23,290 --> 00:33:29,290]  We know that they will have the 5G devices ready for like a fourth quarter\n",
            "[00:33:29,290 --> 00:33:30,290]  this year.\n",
            "[00:33:30,290 --> 00:33:35,290]  So we can also make those available for consumers because, you know,\n",
            "[00:33:35,290 --> 00:33:39,290]  for the early adopters I think we can offer some, you know,\n",
            "[00:33:39,290 --> 00:33:43,290]  discounts just for that and then to, you know, to boost up the interest.\n",
            "[00:33:43,290 --> 00:33:48,290]  Because with the 5G handset they can still support the 4G,\n",
            "[00:33:48,290 --> 00:33:50,290]  but then they will already, you know,\n",
            "[00:33:50,290 --> 00:33:53,290]  if they are at the time they need a new phone they might as well get one\n",
            "[00:33:53,290 --> 00:33:57,290]  that will support 5G and then they will be able to use it, you know,\n",
            "[00:33:57,290 --> 00:34:00,090]  in half a year or so.\n",
            "[00:34:00,090 --> 00:34:05,090]  We will have, you know, look at our device strategy,\n",
            "[00:34:05,090 --> 00:34:10,090]  but then devices is always a very strong area in Far East zone.\n",
            "[00:34:11,090 --> 00:34:14,090]  The device management here has been doing very well.\n",
            "[00:34:14,090 --> 00:34:17,090]  So we will continue to do well, you know,\n",
            "[00:34:17,090 --> 00:34:22,090]  when it comes to 5G with all these additional available devices\n",
            "[00:34:22,090 --> 00:34:23,090]  to work with.\n",
            "[00:34:23,090 --> 00:34:27,810]  Okay, that was one question.\n",
            "[00:34:27,810 --> 00:34:31,810]  And I'm sorry, I may have forgot your second question.\n",
            "[00:34:31,810 --> 00:34:33,810]  What was your second question?\n",
            "[00:34:33,810 --> 00:34:38,810]  Okay, so the contribution of the new business segment.\n",
            "[00:34:39,810 --> 00:34:44,420]  I think in the quarter the segment looks doing pretty well.\n",
            "[00:34:44,420 --> 00:34:50,450]  So, like, do you still expect the contribution of this segment to be\n",
            "[00:34:50,450 --> 00:34:56,190]  around 13%, 14% or go even higher for the whole year?\n",
            "[00:34:56,190 --> 00:35:05,990]  Our goal for this year is 14 point something, right, 13.4%, right?\n",
            "[00:35:05,990 --> 00:35:07,990]  So that is our goal.\n",
            "[00:35:07,990 --> 00:35:11,990]  And, of course, I would like my team to continue to build up.\n",
            "[00:35:11,990 --> 00:35:15,990]  We do have higher, our forecast for the second half is higher, right?\n",
            "[00:35:15,990 --> 00:35:17,990]  We actually, when we do the forecast,\n",
            "[00:35:17,990 --> 00:35:21,990]  we expect our second half to be more, revenue-wise,\n",
            "[00:35:21,990 --> 00:35:23,990]  to be more and higher than the first half.\n",
            "[00:35:23,990 --> 00:35:26,990]  So even though we are doing pretty well,\n",
            "[00:35:26,990 --> 00:35:29,990]  but then it's not quite where we are yet.\n",
            "[00:35:29,990 --> 00:35:36,430]  So I expect in the second half we will pick up the momentum even more.\n",
            "[00:35:36,430 --> 00:35:39,430]  And 13.4% is our goal for the year.\n",
            "[00:35:39,430 --> 00:35:43,230]  And I'd like to see that exceeded.\n",
            "[00:35:43,230 --> 00:35:44,230]  Okay, great, thank you.\n",
            "[00:35:44,230 --> 00:35:46,230]  And then I have one follow-up.\n",
            "[00:35:46,230 --> 00:35:56,060]  Can you give us some color on the guidance for KPACs in terms of 5G?\n",
            "[00:35:56,060 --> 00:36:01,060]  We don't have exact numbers, but then, you know,\n",
            "[00:36:01,060 --> 00:36:04,060]  kind of like in the past you could see, right, with the option\n",
            "[00:36:04,060 --> 00:36:07,060]  and then with the five telcos.\n",
            "[00:36:08,060 --> 00:36:12,060]  But the rules now, NCC has passed,\n",
            "[00:36:12,060 --> 00:36:16,060]  and hopefully that will bring some rationale into the bidding process.\n",
            "[00:36:16,060 --> 00:36:21,060]  So we are preparing for the worst, but then we are hoping for the best.\n",
            "[00:36:21,060 --> 00:36:30,560]  Okay, so will we be seeing the spike in 5G-related KPACs next year\n",
            "[00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:36,240]  or the year after, or even in 2022?\n",
            "[00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:40,240]  Okay, so in terms of a KPAC investment, right, you know,\n",
            "[00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:44,240]  if you just look at the obligation that NCC has for any bidder\n",
            "[00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:46,240]  or any bidder that walks away with spectrum,\n",
            "[00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:53,240]  we have five years to, you know, to build, to cover 50% of the population\n",
            "[00:36:53,240 --> 00:36:57,240]  and then to finish at least 1,000 stations, which is a small number actually.\n",
            "[00:36:57,240 --> 00:37:00,240]  So we do have five years to do that.\n",
            "[00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:03,240]  But then, you know, like I said, you know,\n",
            "[00:37:03,240 --> 00:37:07,240]  we have to look at the demand, right, at the time,\n",
            "[00:37:07,240 --> 00:37:13,240]  and also look at what other services may be available to offer.\n",
            "[00:37:13,240 --> 00:37:17,240]  So as we do, we will always be very careful,\n",
            "[00:37:17,240 --> 00:37:21,240]  and then we want to optimize our capital investment.\n",
            "[00:37:21,240 --> 00:37:26,240]  That is just whatever we do, so not just like on the 5G capital investment.\n",
            "[00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:30,240]  But we'll be very careful in our capital investment plan.\n",
            "[00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:32,240]  We certainly don't need to worry about the capital,\n",
            "[00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:34,240]  but we will optimize the investment\n",
            "[00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:38,240]  and then hopefully maximizing the benefit of it.\n",
            "[00:37:38,240 --> 00:37:41,740]  Okay, great. Thank you so much.\n",
            "[00:37:41,740 --> 00:37:42,840]  Sure.\n",
            "[00:37:42,840 --> 00:37:48,680]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are now in question and answer session.\n",
            "[00:37:48,680 --> 00:37:53,680]  If you would like to ask a question, please press 01 on your telephone keypad.\n",
            "[00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:54,680]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:37:54,680 --> 00:38:00,960]  And the next question is coming from Billy Lee of Credit Suisse.\n",
            "[00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:01,960]  Go ahead, please.\n",
            "[00:38:03,880 --> 00:38:07,880]  Hello. Thanks for the answer before.\n",
            "[00:38:07,880 --> 00:38:12,880]  I'm a little bit confused about the handset strategy that you talked about\n",
            "[00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:16,880]  because if I look at the equipment revenue in the second quarter,\n",
            "[00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:20,880]  it's down by 5.2%, whereas in the first quarter,\n",
            "[00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:23,880]  you're able to grow by 3.8%.\n",
            "[00:38:23,880 --> 00:38:27,880]  So could you explain a little bit about why the drop here\n",
            "[00:38:27,880 --> 00:38:30,880]  in terms of the equipment revenue?\n",
            "[00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:36,880]  And then my second question is on the 5G auctions,\n",
            "[00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:41,880]  the spectrum auction that you just touched on.\n",
            "[00:38:41,880 --> 00:38:51,880]  Could you help us to put a perspective on the competitiveness of the auction?\n",
            "[00:38:51,880 --> 00:38:56,880]  Do you expect a more aggressive competition this time versus the 4G?\n",
            "[00:38:56,880 --> 00:39:02,880]  And the third question is what's your latest dividend payout policy?\n",
            "[00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:03,880]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:39:03,880 --> 00:39:06,390]  Okay.\n",
            "[00:39:06,390 --> 00:39:09,390]  So my team is checking on the device that you were asking.\n",
            "[00:39:09,390 --> 00:39:12,390]  So let me answer the 5G first.\n",
            "[00:39:12,390 --> 00:39:16,390]  So in terms of the landscape, as you know, there are five telcos,\n",
            "[00:39:16,390 --> 00:39:23,390]  and all express their intention to participate in the auction.\n",
            "[00:39:23,390 --> 00:39:26,390]  So if you just look at the number of telcos, right,\n",
            "[00:39:26,390 --> 00:39:31,390]  and then so the competition is foreseeable.\n",
            "[00:39:31,390 --> 00:39:35,390]  If you want to compare to 4G, even though I wasn't here at the time,\n",
            "[00:39:35,390 --> 00:39:39,390]  but I do know when they were building for the 1800, right,\n",
            "[00:39:39,390 --> 00:39:42,390]  Chunghwa had to bid really wild price for that.\n",
            "[00:39:42,390 --> 00:39:46,390]  But then I think people all have learned some lesson from that.\n",
            "[00:39:46,390 --> 00:39:49,390]  So I don't think 5G will be as bad.\n",
            "[00:39:50,390 --> 00:39:57,390]  And also with the rules, well, first of all, the 3.5 gig spectrum\n",
            "[00:39:57,390 --> 00:40:05,390]  with only 270 MEC, right, for five companies to bid for.\n",
            "[00:40:05,390 --> 00:40:12,390]  And unlike 4G, right, 5G, to really take advantage of the technology,\n",
            "[00:40:12,390 --> 00:40:18,390]  you really need to have like 80 to 100 or so kind of bandwidth to really do its magic.\n",
            "[00:40:18,390 --> 00:40:25,390]  So, you know, with five telcos, if everybody is just like regardless at all costs\n",
            "[00:40:25,390 --> 00:40:32,390]  and then, you know, want to go in, and then, you know, you may get 10 or 20 or that.\n",
            "[00:40:32,390 --> 00:40:36,390]  Then if you look at it, what can you do with 10 or 20 or even 30, right?\n",
            "[00:40:36,390 --> 00:40:41,390]  So realistically speaking, it's not going to be cost effective to build a network,\n",
            "[00:40:41,390 --> 00:40:44,390]  you know, and then when you buy the equipment,\n",
            "[00:40:44,390 --> 00:40:49,390]  it is equipped for like 100 MEC bandwidth, right?\n",
            "[00:40:49,390 --> 00:40:53,390]  So you are underutilizing what you paid for to begin with.\n",
            "[00:40:53,390 --> 00:41:00,390]  And then you still have the same obligation as the other telcos that get 100 or 80 or 90, whatever.\n",
            "[00:41:00,390 --> 00:41:06,390]  So I just think, you know, if every telco does their really thorough thinking,\n",
            "[00:41:06,390 --> 00:41:13,390]  maybe going all the way for the spectrum is not really everybody's best strategy.\n",
            "[00:41:13,390 --> 00:41:21,390]  So, you know, with that in mind, I, you know, like I said, we are preparing for the worst,\n",
            "[00:41:21,390 --> 00:41:28,390]  but then on the other hand, I'm also hoping for the best because if every telco does their own analysis,\n",
            "[00:41:28,390 --> 00:41:32,390]  they should know that, you know, getting some spectrum is not the only option\n",

            "[00:01:47,090 --> 00:01:53,810]  the decline seems to have stabilized. So for two quarters in a row, right, we were dropping by one\n",
            "[00:01:54,290 --> 00:02:00,770]  and one billion. And then so that is about 2.6 percent drop quarter over quarter. So we would\n",

            "[00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:21,060]  increase. This is good because we were anticipating, you know, declining in this\n",
            "[00:02:21,060 --> 00:02:27,780]  area as well. But then for several quarters in a row, we actually are increasing. And then on\n",
            "[00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:33,780]  the other hand, for the post-phase churn, right, that is something we have been very closely\n",
            "[00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:41,780]  monitoring and managing. It has continued to go down and then we now reach our all-time low at\n",
            "[00:02:41,780 --> 00:02:48,900]  1.46 percent. And on the right-hand side, it is talking about our customer satisfaction.\n",
            "[00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:56,420]  As you can see from the chart, right, the line continues to go up. So we do have\n",
            "[00:02:56,420 --> 00:03:05,630]  happy customers that we serve. The next slide. So we have been talking about the new economy is our\n",

            "[00:03:12,590 --> 00:03:19,230]  for the ICT revenue growth for the year over year. And then we see a 38 percent increase\n",
            "[00:03:19,230 --> 00:03:27,150]  from last year. And then in terms of the contract amount, knowing this is not realized revenue yet,\n",
            "[00:03:27,150 --> 00:03:33,470]  but this does show the momentum, right, because what is in the pipeline, that is already committed.\n",
            "[00:03:34,110 --> 00:03:39,710]  And then we are looking at almost 200 percent increase. That means it has tripled what we had\n",
            "[00:03:39,710 --> 00:03:45,310]  a year ago in the first quarter. And then on the digital service revenue side, that is\n",
            "[00:03:45,310 --> 00:03:50,430]  more towards the consumer. And then we are showing a 15 percent growth as well,\n",
            "[00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:54,270]  which is all good news. And I have to say I cannot complain. With that,\n",
            "[00:03:54,270 --> 00:03:59,390]  I am going to give you Sherman to provide the details on the financials for you. Sherman.\n",
            "[00:03:59,390 --> 00:04:06,980]  Okay. Yes. Now, let's go to the financials. And on the left-hand side, the total revenue of our\n",
            "[00:04:06,980 --> 00:04:40,990]  firm in the first quarter basically fell with the previous quarter. But on the right-hand side,\n",
            "[00:04:41,070 --> 00:04:53,500]  our output continues to decline in the industry trend. But we foresee this to go okay.\n",
            "[00:04:55,020 --> 00:05:01,180]  So this demonstrates our EBITDA performance. And you can see that on the first quarter this year,\n",
            "[00:05:01,180 --> 00:05:12,300]  our EBITDA on pre-SIS 16 basis is $6.55 billion. That is 31.5 percent. And that matched the first\n",
            "[00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:21,760]  quarter last year. And so I would say that right now because of spending control and all the\n",
            "[00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:29,970]  efforts we are taking, right now we are back to 6. And so for the net income, the first quarter\n",
            "[00:05:29,970 --> 00:05:52,590]  this year, we achieved 2.2. And the next page shows our performance. We overachieved our budget.\n",
            "[00:05:52,590 --> 00:05:59,660]  And then our net income and EPS are 4 percent higher than our guidance. And so the first quarter\n",
            "[00:05:59,660 --> 00:06:18,670]  EPS is $0.68. And the next page shows our cash on hand in this quarter increased from $4.2 billion\n",
            "[00:06:18,670 --> 00:06:29,710]  to $6.4 billion. And then our net debt reduced from $23.9 billion to $18.6 billion. And our\n",
            "[00:06:29,710 --> 00:06:40,990]  shareholder equity of course increased by $2.3 billion. Our net debt ratio to EBITDA reduced.\n",
            "[00:06:40,990 --> 00:06:47,870]  And our free cash flow the first quarter is $5.7 billion. But I have to remind you that\n",
            "[00:06:47,870 --> 00:06:54,430]  our inventory reduced in the first quarter by $1.5 billion. That contributed a lot to the free cash\n",
            "[00:06:54,510 --> 00:07:07,470]  flow. And so far we can see that our cash flow actually confirmed with our guidance,\n",
            "[00:07:07,470 --> 00:07:13,820]  our internal projection. That concludes my part.\n",
            "[00:07:13,820 --> 00:07:25,360]  All right. I'd like to share with you all about some of our one, two or first quarter highlights\n",
            "[00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:40,640]  and then our TVC campaign. And we have launched it in March and finished it in April. We have\n",
            "[00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:48,240]  received a lot of viewership. And we got very good, very positive responses. And it is an effort\n",
            "[00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:56,720]  to let the consumers know or the consumers in Taiwan in general, both consumer and enterprise\n",
            "[00:07:56,720 --> 00:08:05,040]  actually, that Far East Zone is transforming from what is used to be a traditional telecom\n",
            "[00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:14,560]  to a telecom plus that we are into the digital services and also the IoT, AIoT, the advanced\n",
            "[00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:22,240]  enterprise solutions domain. And then so the video helped to depict that. And we were pleased\n",
            "[00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:29,360]  with the result we see so far. And then we also launched our first 5G new radio trial site. And\n",
            "[00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:36,800]  we actually did that at a Smart TV Summit that was in March. And then we also demoed 8K video\n",
            "[00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:44,000]  use of 5G and now we set up there. And in terms of the continuous effort on the\n",
            "[00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:51,040]  transformation side, for channel we have launched our first combo store with Louisa Coffee. This\n",
            "[00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:58,000]  is our first store. And this is our effort to make our store more versatile. And then\n",
            "[00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:04,500]  so we can attract more traffic into the store. And then this is our first launch. And then\n",
            "[00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:13,120]  we will have more in the months to come. And in the digital services area that is on\n",
            "[00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:17,840]  the consumer side, we actually have launched quite a few things such as the Mimi Smart\n",
            "[00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:27,700]  speakers, our CIoT device. And then we have the Friday and also we are relaunching our Friday\n",
            "[00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:41,970]  shopping plan. And then we continue to show, we continue to see a very good momentum with our\n",
            "[00:09:41,970 --> 00:09:49,890]  ICT business. Actually, in the first quarter, we were awarded a very big contract that involved\n",
            "[00:09:50,210 --> 00:09:58,610]  integrating a big system for a big insurance company. And so that was a big win. And then\n",
            "[00:09:58,610 --> 00:10:08,610]  we also launched the first green energy station with our CPC China Petroleum Company. And that\n",

            "[00:10:21,550 --> 00:10:27,950]  in the park. And why I would show as a highlight because this was internally developed by our\n",
            "[00:10:27,950 --> 00:10:36,270]  transformation office. As you know, we've been focusing on improving or adding more strength\n",

            "[00:10:49,890 --> 00:11:06,770]  result from the ‚Äì and then a few here and that is also the Asia's Best CFO and then also we won\n",

            "[00:11:14,370 --> 00:11:22,770]  not least, I need to highlight it although we wouldn't consider it as totally positive but that's\n",
            "[00:11:22,850 --> 00:11:29,970]  not under our control. That is the NCC has moved up the 5G spectrum auction target date. It was\n",
            "[00:11:29,970 --> 00:11:36,290]  going to be June next year but then they have decided to move it up and it's targeted before\n",
            "[00:11:36,290 --> 00:11:42,700]  the end of the year that the auction will ‚Äì and actually in August they will start receiving the\n",
            "[00:11:42,700 --> 00:11:48,620]  application. So we definitely are looking at a much shortened timeframe to work on it.\n",
            "[00:11:49,340 --> 00:11:58,460]  So with that, our second quarter focus, we will gear up for 5G and this will involve our work\n",
            "[00:11:58,460 --> 00:12:07,570]  for prepare for the spectrum auction and also our network. You have to ‚Äì our core network in order\n",
            "[00:12:07,570 --> 00:12:16,240]  for it to support the non-standard. So that is already ongoing with my team and then also we are\n",

            "[00:13:58,060 --> 00:14:04,540]  the continuous increase in that regard. So that is definitely a good thing. And then we will\n",

            "[00:14:24,780 --> 00:14:32,060]  to drive down our op cost and also optimize our investment. We wanted to be really, really lean\n",
            "[00:14:32,060 --> 00:14:38,220]  and then so while improving the revenue is itself a lot of effort and then we are also\n",
            "[00:14:38,220 --> 00:14:44,660]  not overlooking any opportunity to drive down our cost. Okay. With that and I think\n",

            "[00:15:49,070 --> 00:15:55,710]  I have a couple of questions regarding virus toll 5G strategy. First of all, you mentioned about\n",
            "[00:15:55,710 --> 00:16:02,750]  non-standalone and the need to upgrade our core network. As a company, have we decided to\n",
            "[00:16:03,950 --> 00:16:09,470]  go the non-standalone route out of 5G network? And if that's the case, what exactly we need to do\n",
            "[00:16:10,670 --> 00:16:14,670]  on the core network in order to be able to provide non-standalone service?\n",
            "[00:16:15,820 --> 00:16:21,580]  And a related question to that is, do we have any estimate on what kind of cat packs we need\n",
            "[00:16:22,140 --> 00:16:27,740]  on both the new radio equipment and also the upgrade of our core network?\n",
            "[00:16:28,780 --> 00:16:35,820]  And the second question I have is, given the current competitive pressure on 4G Apple,\n",
            "[00:16:35,820 --> 00:16:41,420]  how confident we are as a company that we can kind of have a decent return on investment for\n",
            "[00:16:41,420 --> 00:16:48,860]  the 5G cat packs? And in terms of revenue opportunity, where do we see the incremental\n",
            "[00:16:48,860 --> 00:16:54,700]  revenue coming from for both the consumer market and also the enterprise market?\n",
            "[00:16:55,920 --> 00:17:03,840]  And lastly, a question on spectrum. So, if I still have any preference in terms of\n",
            "[00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:11,680]  spectrum bandwidth between low, mid, and high frequency band, including mid-band and\n",
            "[00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:19,550]  the millimeter waves? Thank you. All right. That's three sets of questions. I'll answer\n",
            "[00:17:20,270 --> 00:17:26,270]  the first set first. So, you were asking about the non-standalone architecture. Yes. In order to,\n",
            "[00:17:27,070 --> 00:17:44,510]  well, first of all, because of the given timeframe. And then you were asking then\n",
            "[00:17:44,510 --> 00:17:50,910]  what kind of efforts would it involve, such as the upgrade of the core. So, for the core network,\n",
            "[00:17:50,910 --> 00:17:56,590]  in order for it to work with the new radio on the 5G side, there is software that needs to be\n",
            "[00:17:56,590 --> 00:18:02,030]  upgraded. And then our core network is with Ericsson. So, we are working, we've been working\n",
            "[00:18:02,030 --> 00:18:08,700]  with Ericsson on some of the testing and all that. And so, and then we have a plan, and then\n",
            "[00:18:15,180 --> 00:18:22,540]  first. So, that is undergoing. The cost on this is relatively small, if you were asking about\n",
            "[00:18:22,540 --> 00:18:28,380]  the cost. And there is some upgrade on the capacity, on the transport. That needs to be\n",
            "[00:18:28,380 --> 00:18:34,220]  planned out as well. But still, those costs, if you compare to the anticipated spectrum,\n",
            "[00:18:35,180 --> 00:18:43,020]  and then those are not as significant, I can tell you that. But then in terms of the exact numbers\n",
            "[00:18:43,020 --> 00:18:48,380]  and all that, that is still being worked out by my network department and the finance department.\n",
            "[00:18:48,380 --> 00:18:56,540]  So, I don't have any specific figures to share with you at this point. As to your second question,\n",
            "[00:18:56,540 --> 00:19:06,860]  that is about the 5G, the R pool, and the 4G. Okay. So, as you know, I think in 2014, that's\n",
            "[00:19:06,860 --> 00:19:15,100]  where the telcos in Taiwan launched the 4G, right? And then the license went for 15 years. So,\n",
            "[00:19:15,100 --> 00:19:22,460]  we are still only like five years or four years into the license. We still have like 11 more years\n",
            "[00:19:22,540 --> 00:19:29,420]  in terms of amortization, right, over the capital spending and all that. And so, that's 4G. And then\n",
            "[00:19:29,420 --> 00:19:36,060]  we already see all this price competition from the consumer side. So, that is not a pretty picture.\n",
            "[00:19:36,060 --> 00:19:44,780]  Now, how do I foresee what is going to happen with 5G? I think that's a million-dollar question.\n",
            "[00:19:45,340 --> 00:19:53,180]  And then so, on one hand, you know, even though our government wanted to kind of do the 5G as\n",
            "[00:19:53,180 --> 00:19:59,100]  fast as possible, we certainly are not among the first few, right, in the world, which is really\n",
            "[00:19:59,100 --> 00:20:07,820]  not a bad thing. And then so, we already have like AT&T, Verizon in the state. And then also Korea,\n",
            "[00:20:07,820 --> 00:20:17,100]  we have the SKT, right? So, we can look at how they are doing. And then so, we are hopefully\n",
            "[00:20:17,100 --> 00:20:23,740]  going to learn some lessons from them. But if you ask me now, I would say I would count on more\n",
            "[00:20:24,780 --> 00:20:32,220]  revenue from the enterprise side because we could see the advanced applications in the IoT area\n",
            "[00:20:32,220 --> 00:20:39,340]  that could take advantage of or benefit from 5G, more so than the consumer. Because right now,\n",
            "[00:20:39,340 --> 00:20:47,580]  our consumers are already very well served by the 4G, the kind of penetration that the five\n",
            "[00:20:47,580 --> 00:20:53,820]  telcos have collectively provided. Even any of us, you know, alone, it has pretty good ‚Äì the\n",
            "[00:20:53,820 --> 00:20:59,580]  big three, I should say, not all five. The big three all have very good coverage alone, right,\n",
            "[00:20:59,580 --> 00:21:08,370]  to serve us. And then so, right now, there are really not a single killer application that is\n",
            "[00:21:08,370 --> 00:21:18,210]  available yet anywhere that would drive the need for 5G on the consumer side. And also, it will\n",
            "[00:21:18,210 --> 00:21:24,050]  require the device, right? And then so, the handset device. So, the handset device is still just\n",
            "[00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:33,220]  starting. So, how willing are the consumers going to, you know, upgrade their handset device just\n",
            "[00:21:33,220 --> 00:21:41,460]  for 5G where they don't see anything much different or they already are very happy with what they get\n",
            "[00:21:41,460 --> 00:21:47,460]  as a service. So, would they want to pay a lot more for that before some applications are\n",
            "[00:21:48,180 --> 00:21:52,260]  available or justifiable? I doubt that. And I think it will take some time.\n",
            "[00:21:53,220 --> 00:21:58,900]  So, hopefully, by the time we deploy the network, let's say by the end of next year,\n",
            "[00:21:58,900 --> 00:22:04,340]  and then that's another year and a half from now, and then you never know, right? The software\n",
            "[00:22:04,340 --> 00:22:11,860]  doesn't take long to be deployed. But then the question is where will some people just have that\n",
            "[00:22:12,820 --> 00:22:20,820]  creative idea and just bring up some great, you know, new applications or new needs for the\n",
            "[00:22:20,820 --> 00:22:27,620]  consumers. So, we are hopeful something will happen. And then by the end of next year,\n",
            "[00:22:27,620 --> 00:22:31,620]  when we deploy the network, hopefully, there are more lessons learned from the other\n",
            "[00:22:33,380 --> 00:22:43,220]  telcos in the rest of the world that will help us more smartly make our investment to our network.\n",
            "[00:22:43,220 --> 00:22:49,380]  But one thing I would say, given where we are right now, our deployment strategy will be\n",
            "[00:22:50,460 --> 00:22:57,820]  right. So, we are not in any rush to quickly cover the whole island, you know, fully penetrated like\n",
            "[00:22:57,820 --> 00:23:05,340]  what we have with 4G. That took us only like three years. So, I think 5G, we will be cautious\n",
            "[00:23:05,980 --> 00:23:13,820]  in terms of investment. And then we will be closely watching, learning from the other telcos that are\n",
            "[00:23:13,820 --> 00:23:21,410]  ahead of us. Okay. So, I do not see the R pool to increase because of 5G in the next couple years.\n",
            "[00:23:22,370 --> 00:23:40,610]  But then, and then that is not just, but then I can't. Okay. The third question, I think you were\n",
            "[00:23:40,610 --> 00:23:47,170]  asking me if we had a preference on the mid band or the higher band, which is a 28G, right? Versus\n",
            "[00:23:47,170 --> 00:23:54,210]  the 3.5G. Well, in our, you know, I think this is like you can't just have either. You will need\n",
            "[00:23:54,210 --> 00:24:02,210]  both, right? So, we will definitely have presence in both bands. We will need both, if that answers\n",

            "[00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:41,520]  the telecom market we consider is still quite stable.\n",
            "[00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:46,520]  The competitive landscape, I think we compete with each other,\n",
            "[00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:50,520]  but I think overall it's still quite a rational market.\n",
            "[00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:54,520]  In terms of Far East Tongue's performance, our first three quarters,\n",
            "[00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:58,520]  our mobile service revenue is growing 3% on a year-on-year basis,\n",
            "[00:01:58,520 --> 00:02:02,520]  and our data revenue is 29% on a year-on-year basis.\n",
            "[00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:07,520]  You can see the main growth driver is still coming from the mobile broadband.\n",
            "[00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:11,520]  In terms of the service revenue share change,\n",
            "[00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:14,520]  comparing the first three quarters with the same period of last year,\n",
            "[00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:19,520]  our top-line growth is relatively flat.\n",
            "[00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:28,870]  The main reason is being that we start to see a rapid decline on our voice revenues.\n",
            "[00:02:28,870 --> 00:02:31,870]  On the right-hand side, which is the EBITDA growth\n",
            "[00:02:31,870 --> 00:02:34,870]  and the net income growth in the first three quarters\n",
            "[00:02:34,870 --> 00:02:36,870]  versus the same period of last year,\n",
            "[00:02:36,870 --> 00:02:43,870]  we are pleased to report that Far East Tongue actually performs the best in the industry\n",
            "[00:02:43,870 --> 00:02:48,870]  in terms of the EBITDA and the bottom-line growth.\n",
            "[00:02:48,870 --> 00:02:56,300]  With a very brief market update,\n",
            "[00:02:56,300 --> 00:03:01,300]  I'll move into the specific operational performances of Far East Tongue.\n",
            "[00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:05,300]  The first page is our subscribers.\n",
            "[00:03:05,300 --> 00:03:12,300]  This is the key for our growth, and we continue to report a growth,\n",
            "[00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:18,300]  and this is the 41 consecutive months that we continue to grow our customer base.\n",
            "[00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:23,300]  Year-on-year, we continue to manage our customer growth about 4%.\n",
            "[00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:26,300]  In terms of the traffic and our pool,\n",
            "[00:03:26,300 --> 00:03:29,300]  and on the post-pay overall traffic,\n",
            "[00:03:29,300 --> 00:03:35,300]  we are seeing a 5.4% drop on a year-on-year basis.\n",
            "[00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:40,300]  We believe this is because of the mobile broadband being picked up\n",
            "[00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:45,300]  and more and more usage has been transferred into the IP messaging.\n",
            "[00:03:45,300 --> 00:03:48,300]  Therefore, if you look at our pool,\n",
            "[00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:53,300]  you also see a slight decline about 2.5% on a year-on-year basis.\n",
            "[00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:59,990]  The majority is coming from the voice revenue decline.\n",
            "[00:03:59,990 --> 00:04:02,990]  Also, the mobile termination rate,\n",
            "[00:04:02,990 --> 00:04:10,990]  which this year we continue to have this government impose upon the mobile revenue decline.\n",
            "[00:04:10,990 --> 00:04:20,820]  On the consolidated revenue, our year-on-year growth is about 2%.\n",
            "[00:04:21,820 --> 00:04:23,820]  Actually, on the third quarter of this year,\n",
            "[00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:26,820]  it still maintains quite a healthy level,\n",
            "[00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:29,820]  and that's how we look at our overall top line.\n",
            "[00:04:29,820 --> 00:04:31,820]  In terms of mobile service revenue,\n",
            "[00:04:31,820 --> 00:04:35,820]  it's also a 2% growth on a year-on-year basis.\n",
            "[00:04:35,820 --> 00:04:42,940]  We continue to break the record of the top line growth.\n",
            "[00:04:42,940 --> 00:04:45,940]  In terms of the consolidated EBITDA,\n",
            "[00:04:45,940 --> 00:04:49,940]  we just shared with you on the first page that year-on-year,\n",
            "[00:04:49,940 --> 00:04:55,940]  our EBITDA has reached $6.7 billion in the third quarter.\n",
            "[00:04:55,940 --> 00:05:02,940]  It's actually the highest EBITDA we have ever seen in the past few years,\n",
            "[00:05:02,940 --> 00:05:06,940]  and year-on-year growth is about 4.7%.\n",
            "[00:05:06,940 --> 00:05:13,940]  Net income, this quarter we also reported quite a good net income result,\n",
            "[00:05:13,940 --> 00:05:15,940]  which is $3.2 billion.\n",
            "[00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:19,940]  Year-on-year is 4.4% growth.\n",
            "[00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:25,440]  As I just mentioned,\n",
            "[00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:30,440]  the mobile data growth continues to be the growth driver.\n",
            "[00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:32,440]  On a year-on-year basis,\n",
            "[00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:36,440]  our mobile data is still growing 29%.\n",
            "[00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:39,440]  By the end of the third quarter of this year,\n",
            "[00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:45,440]  the total data revenue represents close to 38% of our total service revenue.\n",
            "[00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:48,440]  In terms of data service subscriber growth,\n",
            "[00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:50,440]  it's even higher.\n",
            "[00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:54,440]  It's 34% on a year-on-year growth basis,\n",
            "[00:05:54,440 --> 00:06:00,440]  and we are reaching close to $2.9 million at the end of the third quarter.\n",
            "[00:06:02,110 --> 00:06:08,110]  Our consolidated financial achievement in the first three quarters,\n",
            "[00:06:08,110 --> 00:06:12,110]  I think all the way from the top line to the bottom line,\n",
            "[00:06:12,110 --> 00:06:18,110]  we have met our financial forecast,\n",
            "[00:06:18,110 --> 00:06:20,110]  except for the service revenue,\n",
            "[00:06:20,110 --> 00:06:24,110]  we're slightly behind our financial forecast.\n",
            "[00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:32,020]  Our balance sheet continues to be very, very strong.\n",
            "[00:06:32,020 --> 00:06:40,020]  We're still sitting with 18 billion cash at the end of the third quarter.\n",
            "[00:06:41,020 --> 00:06:47,020]  We're still, as a free cash flow positive,\n",
            "[00:06:47,020 --> 00:06:50,020]  about $7.6 billion,\n",
            "[00:06:50,020 --> 00:06:53,020]  and it's still a net cash position.\n",
            "[00:06:54,020 --> 00:07:00,380]  Moving into the business update,\n",
            "[00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:08,380]  basically the smart devices update continues to be very, very fast.\n",
            "[00:07:09,380 --> 00:07:14,380]  In the third quarter, our total new devices sold out\n",
            "[00:07:14,380 --> 00:07:20,380]  is essentially 97% of our total devices sold out,\n",
            "[00:07:20,380 --> 00:07:25,380]  and 57% of our postpaid subscribers are now holding smartphone devices,\n",
            "[00:07:25,380 --> 00:07:32,380]  while only 44% of the postpaid subscribers are actually with the data rate plan,\n",
            "[00:07:32,380 --> 00:07:39,380]  which means we continue to have room to continue to grow our top line data revenues.\n",
            "[00:07:39,380 --> 00:07:44,380]  Another good thing is although the penetration rate continues to grow,\n",
            "[00:07:44,380 --> 00:07:48,380]  but we also see our pool of the smartphone user\n",
            "[00:07:48,380 --> 00:07:52,380]  with the data rate plan is holding up quite nicely\n",
            "[00:07:52,380 --> 00:07:57,380]  at around $14,060 a month.\n",
            "[00:07:58,380 --> 00:08:04,820]  My last page, aside from all this financial and business update,\n",
            "[00:08:04,820 --> 00:08:08,820]  I just want to share with you all the good news.\n",
            "[00:08:08,820 --> 00:08:11,820]  The first thing is regarding service.\n",
            "[00:08:11,820 --> 00:08:17,820]  Bar Eastone has been very, very much emphasizing our service quality to our customers,\n",
            "[00:08:17,820 --> 00:08:24,820]  and in third quarter, we have two very, very important and renowned service awards here in Taiwan.\n",
            "[00:08:25,820 --> 00:08:30,820]  The first one is the gold medal award from the Commercial Times,\n",
            "[00:08:30,820 --> 00:08:35,820]  which is the second straight year that we have won these prizes.\n",
            "[00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:42,820]  The second one is the number one of the mobile and fixed communication sector\n",
            "[00:08:42,820 --> 00:08:44,820]  from the Next Media magazine.\n",
            "[00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:49,820]  Basically, we are being awarded the best service award for the telecom sector.\n",
            "[00:08:50,820 --> 00:08:57,820]  Another very, very good news is our regulatory NCC\n",
            "[00:08:57,820 --> 00:09:02,820]  just announced the network speed testing result in October,\n",
            "[00:09:02,820 --> 00:09:09,820]  and Bar Eastone is ranked number one after all these efforts\n",
            "[00:09:09,820 --> 00:09:14,820]  putting into to continue to improve our network qualities in Taiwan,\n",
            "[00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:21,820]  and this continues to prove that we are basically trying very, very hard,\n",
            "[00:09:21,820 --> 00:09:26,820]  and we have achieved good results trying to provide our end consumer\n",
            "[00:09:26,820 --> 00:09:31,820]  an end-to-end superior connectivity and all our service quality.\n",

            "[00:09:44,310 --> 00:09:47,310]  That's our Q&A session.\n",
            "[00:09:47,310 --> 00:09:48,410]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:09:48,410 --> 00:09:51,410]  We will now begin our question and answer session.\n",
            "[00:09:51,410 --> 00:09:54,410]  If you have a question for today of speakers,\n",

            "[00:09:58,410 --> 00:10:01,410]  After you are announced, please ask your question.\n",
            "[00:10:01,410 --> 00:10:06,410]  If you find that your question has been answered before it is your turn to speak,\n",

            "[00:10:09,410 --> 00:10:13,410]  Right now, please press 01 to ask question.\n",
            "[00:10:14,570 --> 00:10:21,000]  Our first question is from Barclays Arnold.\n",
            "[00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000]  Yes, hi, good afternoon.\n",
            "[00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:26,000]  This is Anand Ramachandran calling from Barclays.\n",
            "[00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,000]  Thank you so much for the call and congratulations on the good numbers.\n",
            "[00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000]  I have two questions.\n",
            "[00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:34,000]  First question, you know, I wanted to check with you\n",
            "[00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:43,000]  on how the current 4G bidding process may impact your thoughts on dividends\n",
            "[00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:47,000]  for 2013 or into 2014.\n",
            "[00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:50,000]  So any broad thoughts around that would be useful.\n",
            "[00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000]  That's question number one.\n",
            "[00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:58,000]  Question number two is from the smart device statistics slide.\n",
            "[00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:04,000]  You indicate your ARPU of average smartphone user with data rate plan is,\n",
            "[00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:11,000]  you know, 1,460 NT, and that's 44% of your post-paid subs.\n",
            "[00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:18,000]  But then you also indicate that your blended contract ARPU for third quarter is 875.\n",
            "[00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,000]  So if I just, you know, average the numbers out,\n",
            "[00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:26,000]  you know, people who don't own smartphones but are post-paid subscribers,\n",
            "[00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,000]  you know, they have an ARPU of $415.\n",
            "[00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:32,000]  At least that's what it tells me, right, if you just work the mathematics out.\n",
            "[00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,000]  Question I'm asking is, you know, why is the overall ARPU still not moving up\n",
            "[00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:41,000]  despite, you know, such a high proportion of subscribers being on data rate plan\n",
            "[00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000]  and having such a high ARPU?\n",
            "[00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,480]  Okay.\n",
            "[00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:48,480]  Thanks for the question.\n",
            "[00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:53,480]  Regarding the 4G, because it's still in the middle of the auctions,\n",
            "[00:11:53,480 --> 00:12:00,480]  and I'm sorry that today there will be no 4G-related question can be answered\n",
            "[00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:04,480]  because please wait until the auction is completed\n",
            "[00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:12,480]  and we will give every investor a very detailed update regarding the 4G-related questions.\n",
            "[00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:16,480]  Another question that is relating to the dividend policy.\n",
            "[00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:25,480]  The dividend policy, Far Eastone is always saying that we will maintain our dividend policy, no change,\n",
            "[00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:31,480]  which is at least we commit 100% of our earnings will be paid out in cash.\n",
            "[00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:37,480]  So even with whatever the 4G results coming out, we will not change our dividend policy.\n",
            "[00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:46,480]  Regarding your questions about ARPU, and I will ask our CFO to answer this question.\n",
            "[00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:55,640]  I think the key reason for the lowering of the ARPU for the non-smartphone user base\n",
            "[00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:59,640]  is driven by the reduction in the voice revenue as well.\n",
            "[00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:06,640]  Particularly for the contingent that is using the feature phone for the voice usage,\n",
            "[00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:11,640]  then our revenue, because the reduction in the MTR,\n",
            "[00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:15,640]  definitely the ARPU is going to be lower compared to a year ago.\n",
            "[00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:22,130]  Okay, thank you.\n",
            "[00:13:23,130 --> 00:13:25,630]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:13:25,630 --> 00:13:28,630]  Our next question is from Patty Swiss-Chapman.\n",
            "[00:13:30,630 --> 00:13:34,630]  Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for the opportunity to ask the questions.\n",
            "[00:13:34,630 --> 00:13:38,630]  The first question is regarding the smartphone subscriber you disclosed.\n",
            "[00:13:38,630 --> 00:13:43,630]  I understand that the real penetration is around 44% right now\n",
            "[00:13:43,630 --> 00:13:47,630]  compared to the overall cost of smartphone penetration of 57%.\n",
            "[00:13:47,630 --> 00:13:50,630]  In your opinion, what exactly caused that gap?\n",
            "[00:13:50,630 --> 00:13:54,630]  Why would someone hold a smartphone in their hands and not using data,\n",
            "[00:13:54,630 --> 00:13:56,630]  and what would make them actually start using data?\n",
            "[00:13:56,630 --> 00:14:02,630]  The second question is not directly related to 4G, so I hope you can answer this question.\n",
            "[00:14:02,630 --> 00:14:06,630]  But would you remind us again what would be your target gearing?\n",
            "[00:14:06,630 --> 00:14:11,630]  What's the level of gearing that you would not want to reach or you would be comfortable with?\n",
            "[00:14:11,630 --> 00:14:14,630]  The last question is regarding CAPEX.\n",
            "[00:14:14,630 --> 00:14:17,630]  Regarding CAPEX, I hope again it's not related to 4G,\n",
            "[00:14:17,630 --> 00:14:27,630]  but would you be able to discuss what we'd be looking at in terms of the CAPEX budget for next year?\n",
            "[00:14:27,630 --> 00:14:32,630]  Should we expect it to remain broadly the same, or should it be higher or lower?\n",
            "[00:14:32,630 --> 00:14:37,630]  Is there any clarity on that, or is it also contingent on the 4G option result?\n",
            "[00:14:37,630 --> 00:14:40,140]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:14:40,140 --> 00:14:44,140]  Okay, let me answer your second question and third question first.\n",
            "[00:14:44,140 --> 00:14:46,140]  Your second question concerning the gearing.\n",
            "[00:14:46,140 --> 00:14:53,140]  For FEP, actually we don't have a specific gearing target in mind.\n",
            "[00:14:53,140 --> 00:14:59,140]  But I can share with you that we have benchmarked the telcos throughout Asia Pacific,\n",
            "[00:14:59,140 --> 00:15:09,140]  and we found that the median gearing for Asia Pacific telco is somewhere between 55 and 60%.\n",
            "[00:15:09,140 --> 00:15:15,140]  So we believe there is a lot of room for FEP to gear if we choose to.\n",
            "[00:15:15,140 --> 00:15:19,140]  Of course, when we choose to gear up our balance sheet,\n",
            "[00:15:19,140 --> 00:15:24,140]  we definitely want to make sure that there is a good cost for us to spend the money.\n",
            "[00:15:24,140 --> 00:15:27,140]  And your third question on CAPEX.\n",
            "[00:15:27,140 --> 00:15:38,140]  Sorry, our general guidance to our CAPEX would be hovering around 10 to 12% of our total revenue at this point in time.\n",
            "[00:15:38,140 --> 00:15:43,140]  Although we started our planning process for CAPEX around 4G,\n",
            "[00:15:43,140 --> 00:15:48,140]  but definitely you will be contingent upon the result of which blocks that we are getting.\n",
            "[00:15:48,140 --> 00:15:53,140]  So at this point in time, I cannot share with you in greater detail.\n",
            "[00:15:53,140 --> 00:15:59,190]  Regarding your first question, why customers are having a smartphone\n",
            "[00:15:59,190 --> 00:16:03,190]  but not really attached with the data rates.\n",
            "[00:16:04,190 --> 00:16:16,700]  Maybe, or some of the customers, because they just have old phones and they buy new ones,\n",
            "[00:16:16,700 --> 00:16:25,700]  so that some of the old phones are probably being passed on to their family members to be used at home.\n",
            "[00:16:25,700 --> 00:16:31,700]  So I believe some of them are actually using the phone only with Wi-Fi\n",
            "[00:16:31,700 --> 00:16:35,700]  instead of attaching with the data services.\n",
            "[00:16:35,700 --> 00:16:43,700]  So these are the group of the customers which we will continue our marketing efforts,\n",
            "[00:16:43,700 --> 00:16:47,700]  trying to hook them up by a lighter data rate.\n",
            "[00:16:47,700 --> 00:16:55,700]  In fact, I think in the third quarter of this year, we have been seeing that due to this frontline effort,\n",
            "[00:16:55,700 --> 00:17:02,700]  we have seen that the people that actually take on the light data rate percentage has kept on increasing.\n",
            "[00:17:02,700 --> 00:17:08,700]  So I think this continues to be the segment that we need to put our sales efforts\n",
            "[00:17:08,700 --> 00:17:12,700]  and to actually make them actually sign up a light data rate.\n",
            "[00:17:12,700 --> 00:17:18,700]  Internally, this is an effort to continue to drive up the data revenue\n",
            "[00:17:18,700 --> 00:17:25,700]  and we also perceive this is an opportunity for further data revenue growth.\n",
            "[00:17:25,700 --> 00:17:30,700]  So that's the main reason we have found out from this group of customers.\n",
            "[00:17:30,700 --> 00:17:32,620]  That is great.\n",
            "[00:17:32,620 --> 00:17:37,620]  Just to follow up on my questions about this first thing we discussed,\n",
            "[00:17:37,620 --> 00:17:39,620]  would you be able to share with us two things?\n",
            "[00:17:39,620 --> 00:17:44,620]  Number one, the proportion of users among the 97% that take up smart devices,\n",
            "[00:17:44,620 --> 00:17:47,620]  the higher-end, medium-end, and lower-end,\n",
            "[00:17:47,620 --> 00:17:51,620]  and also some statistics regarding the average usage as well would be nice.\n",
            "[00:17:51,620 --> 00:17:54,420]  Thank you very much.\n",
            "[00:17:54,420 --> 00:17:56,420]  Okay.\n",
            "[00:17:56,420 --> 00:18:03,420]  On the third quarter, the high-end device, I think this is the news that we have to share with you.\n",
            "[00:18:03,420 --> 00:18:09,420]  I think we have already talked to you in the last quarter that we want to manage down our high-end device.\n",
            "[00:18:09,420 --> 00:18:17,420]  And we are happy to report that in third quarter that our high-end device ratio has been continuing trending down.\n",
            "[00:18:17,420 --> 00:18:24,420]  And right now our high-end is how much?\n",
            "[00:18:24,420 --> 00:18:26,420]  45%.\n",
            "[00:18:26,420 --> 00:18:32,420]  So comparing to the previous quarter, what we have shared is 50%.\n",
            "[00:18:32,420 --> 00:18:34,420]  We have managed out 5%.\n",
            "[00:18:35,420 --> 00:18:39,420]  So this is, I would say, our continuous efforts.\n",
            "[00:18:39,420 --> 00:18:45,420]  And our mid-tier right now is about 20%.\n",
            "[00:18:45,420 --> 00:18:50,420]  And our low-tier is about 35%.\n",
            "[00:18:50,420 --> 00:18:54,420]  So this is the ratio for third quarter.\n",
            "[00:18:54,420 --> 00:18:58,420]  So that's why if you look at our third quarter performances,\n",
            "[00:18:58,420 --> 00:19:02,420]  actually our EBITDA margin has improved a little bit.\n",
            "[00:19:02,420 --> 00:19:14,420]  It's mainly due to that we are very focused on driving on the mid-low-tier devices together with the light-tier kind of a data rate plan.\n",
            "[00:19:14,420 --> 00:19:21,420]  So this is the result that personally I'm very pleased to see that the company is driving towards this direction.\n",
            "[00:19:21,420 --> 00:19:27,420]  And we have seen some progress in this result.\n",
            "[00:19:27,420 --> 00:19:35,030]  Another question is regarding the traffic, right?\n",
            "[00:19:36,060 --> 00:19:39,060]  Yes, the average data usage, please.\n",
            "[00:19:39,060 --> 00:19:42,120]  Average data usage.\n",
            "[00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:45,120]  3G per month for smartphones.\n",
            "[00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:50,110]  3G per month for smartphones.\n",
            "[00:19:50,110 --> 00:19:56,720]  That is quite an escalation in usage compared to the last quarter.\n",
            "[00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:57,720]  Yes.\n",
            "[00:19:57,720 --> 00:19:58,720]  Okay, thank you.\n",
            "[00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:06,720]  Just one last question, if you do not mind, on your existing 2G spectrum in 900 and 1800.\n",
            "[00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:11,720]  I understand that it's being extended the usage right to 2017, correct?\n",
            "[00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:16,720]  Can you actually give us the specific date of which it would end?\n",
            "[00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:17,720]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:22,480]  Specific date.\n",
            "[00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:23,480]  Or month.\n",
            "[00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:28,960]  I think this lets our IR team to feed this information back to you.\n",
            "[00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:33,960]  I think we probably will not give you the specific date, but we will give you specific month.\n",
            "[00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:34,960]  Is that okay with you?\n",
            "[00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:36,960]  That is perfect, thank you.\n",
            "[00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:37,960]  Okay, yes.\n",
            "[00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:39,960]  Thank you very much.\n",
            "[00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:41,960]  No problem.\n",
            "[00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:43,120]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:47,120]  As a reminder, please press 01 to ask questions.\n",
            "[00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:51,120]  Our next question is from JP Morgan, Lucy Liu.\n",
            "[00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:53,120]  Hi, thank you.\n",
            "[00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:55,120]  I have three questions.\n",
            "[00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:57,120]  One is on your mobile service revenue.\n",
            "[00:20:57,120 --> 00:21:03,120]  I noticed that in third quarter, the growth still gets a little bit decelerated.\n",
            "[00:21:04,120 --> 00:21:08,120]  Can you comment a little bit on the market dynamics?\n",
            "[00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:15,120]  Why Chunhua and Telemobile are gaining the service revenue market share at expense of us?\n",
            "[00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:17,120]  So this is question number one.\n",
            "[00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:21,120]  Number two is on the margin outlook in fourth quarter.\n",
            "[00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:25,120]  I noticed that in the last year, the base was especially low due to iPhone.\n",
            "[00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:27,120]  This year, but we still have iPhone 5S.\n",
            "[00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:30,120]  How is the iPhone 5S going now?\n",
            "[00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:35,120]  And, you know, are we still going to meet the guidance as given earlier?\n",
            "[00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:37,120]  Lastly is new entrants.\n",
            "[00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:45,120]  So, you know, just wonder your thoughts about the potential competition after the new entrants come\n",
            "[00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:48,120]  and how do you think how competitive they are,\n",
            "[00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:54,120]  and also are we going to do some proactive action before the new entrants come,\n",
            "[00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:57,120]  let's say, in fourth quarter this year or early next year?\n",
            "[00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:58,120]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:21:58,120 --> 00:22:01,430]  Okay.\n",
            "[00:22:01,430 --> 00:22:03,430]  I hope I didn't miss any one of your questions.\n",
            "[00:22:03,430 --> 00:22:09,430]  Let me start with the data revenue, the revenue share performances.\n",
            "[00:22:09,430 --> 00:22:15,430]  I think Far Eastone is the revenue share is relatively flat this year.\n",
            "[00:22:15,430 --> 00:22:20,430]  The major reason, of course, I think I shouldn't really comment on our competitors.\n",
            "[00:22:20,430 --> 00:22:22,430]  You should find out the reason.\n",
            "[00:22:23,430 --> 00:22:27,430]  I think because last year they have actually, because of the network quality,\n",
            "[00:22:27,430 --> 00:22:33,430]  so they have more than a million subscriber, 20% discount on their data revenue.\n",
            "[00:22:33,430 --> 00:22:40,430]  So this year, from January onwards, they just resumed back to 100% data revenue.\n",
            "[00:22:40,430 --> 00:22:43,430]  So that's why I think one of the key reasons for Zhonghua Telecom,\n",
            "[00:22:43,430 --> 00:22:47,430]  the data revenue continues to grow nicely this year.\n",
            "[00:22:47,430 --> 00:22:50,430]  This is one of the major reasons.\n",
            "[00:22:50,430 --> 00:22:56,430]  For us, what we have seen, if you recall, that in the past two years,\n",
            "[00:22:56,430 --> 00:23:01,430]  that Far Eastone data revenue is actually growing the fastest among the big three.\n",
            "[00:23:01,430 --> 00:23:07,430]  But another thing is also because our portfolio is relatively younger\n",
            "[00:23:07,430 --> 00:23:10,430]  than Zhonghua Telecom and Taiwan Mobile.\n",
            "[00:23:10,430 --> 00:23:15,430]  So right now what we have seen is that this group of the users,\n",
            "[00:23:15,430 --> 00:23:17,430]  after they migrate onto the data,\n",
            "[00:23:17,430 --> 00:23:20,430]  then they start to use less and less on the voice revenue.\n",
            "[00:23:20,430 --> 00:23:26,430]  So this year, our service revenue drop rate actually is more,\n",
            "[00:23:26,430 --> 00:23:29,430]  a bit more than our two competitors.\n",
            "[00:23:29,430 --> 00:23:33,430]  We certainly believe while customers is moving on into the data,\n",
            "[00:23:33,430 --> 00:23:38,430]  on the voice revenue share percentage, then we will correspondingly drop down.\n",
            "[00:23:38,430 --> 00:23:43,430]  So I really don't want to forecast for the future,\n",
            "[00:23:43,430 --> 00:23:47,430]  but what we have seen that this is the portfolio.\n",
            "[00:23:47,430 --> 00:23:53,590]  So right now, I mean, I really don't want to forecast on the future,\n",
            "[00:23:53,590 --> 00:23:58,590]  but this is what Far Eastone has seen in our customer portfolio.\n",
            "[00:23:58,590 --> 00:24:00,590]  I certainly, I think to some stage,\n",
            "[00:24:00,590 --> 00:24:06,590]  I expect that in the competitor's portfolio we'll share the same situation.\n",
            "[00:24:06,590 --> 00:24:11,590]  So right now for us, the key thing is for those customers,\n",
            "[00:24:11,590 --> 00:24:13,590]  they have not signed up the data,\n",
            "[00:24:13,590 --> 00:24:18,590]  which essentially we call it the first time data users is our key focus\n",
            "[00:24:18,590 --> 00:24:24,590]  and trying to really push them up to take up a data rate frame.\n",
            "[00:24:24,590 --> 00:24:30,590]  So which I think for this quarter, we continue to see a good progress on this\n",
            "[00:24:30,590 --> 00:24:36,590]  and we just have to continue to do it to maintain our top line growth.\n",
            "[00:24:37,590 --> 00:24:40,590]  Actually, personally, it's very optimistic going forward\n",
            "[00:24:40,590 --> 00:24:45,590]  because while you see that the customer's behavior is being cultivated\n",
            "[00:24:45,590 --> 00:24:49,590]  and they use more and more data traffic while moving to the 4G,\n",
            "[00:24:49,590 --> 00:24:52,590]  if the tier data rate pricing can be introduced,\n",
            "[00:24:52,590 --> 00:24:58,590]  there will be certainly an upside going forward continuously on the data revenue growth.\n",
            "[00:24:59,940 --> 00:25:07,940]  Your second question is regarding the iPhone 5S and 5C,\n",
            "[00:25:07,940 --> 00:25:10,940]  whether it will impact our bottom line this year.\n",
            "[00:25:10,940 --> 00:25:13,940]  My straight answer is no.\n",
            "[00:25:13,940 --> 00:25:17,940]  Our bottom line target guidance for this year will be maintained\n",
            "[00:25:17,940 --> 00:25:21,940]  even though the iPhone 5S and the 5C has been introduced\n",
            "[00:25:21,940 --> 00:25:25,940]  about one and a half months earlier than we expected.\n",
            "[00:25:26,940 --> 00:25:31,940]  Your third question is regarding the new entrance.\n",
            "[00:25:31,940 --> 00:25:39,740]  As I just said, because it's during the auctions, a lot of things could happen.\n",
            "[00:25:39,740 --> 00:25:45,740]  We don't know what eventually that this 4G auctions results will be coming out.\n",
            "[00:25:45,740 --> 00:25:50,740]  So let's wait until this 4G auction is completed,\n",
            "[00:25:50,740 --> 00:25:53,740]  then I will provide you a more complete view\n",
            "[00:25:54,740 --> 00:25:56,740]  being Bar Ishton's own plan\n",
            "[00:25:56,740 --> 00:26:02,740]  and also our views on the potential of the 4G new entrance.\n",
            "[00:26:02,740 --> 00:26:03,740]  Thank you very much.\n",
            "[00:26:03,740 --> 00:26:06,740]  I just have one last question.\n",
            "[00:26:06,740 --> 00:26:10,740]  I remember before I think you mentioned that there's a likelihood for you guys\n",
            "[00:26:10,740 --> 00:26:15,740]  to think about doing tier pricing after going to 4G.\n",
            "[00:26:15,740 --> 00:26:18,740]  I think after penetration of smartphones going high,\n",
            "[00:26:18,740 --> 00:26:21,740]  the monetization of data is definitely the next driver.\n",
            "[00:26:21,740 --> 00:26:27,740]  So are we still thinking of the opportunity like before\n",
            "[00:26:27,740 --> 00:26:30,740]  or do you think in Taiwan, because of the regulatory\n",
            "[00:26:30,740 --> 00:26:35,740]  and the customer-friendly environment, there will be pressure on the price hike?\n",
            "[00:26:35,740 --> 00:26:36,740]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:26:36,740 --> 00:26:41,290]  I'm still, as I just said, personally still very optimistic\n",
            "[00:26:41,290 --> 00:26:45,290]  about the future introduction of the tier data rate plan.\n",
            "[00:26:45,290 --> 00:26:53,290]  I think it's much more healthy for the entire industry going forward.\n",
            "[00:26:53,290 --> 00:26:57,290]  Of course, I think the operation probably needs to help the government\n",
            "[00:26:57,290 --> 00:27:02,290]  to actually let everybody have a chance to hook on to the data network.\n",
            "[00:27:02,290 --> 00:27:05,290]  But we also need to do it more fairly\n",
            "[00:27:05,290 --> 00:27:09,290]  as whoever that use more, they actually have to pay more.\n",
            "[00:27:09,290 --> 00:27:17,290]  So this continues to be our guideline for designing our future 4G data rate plan.\n",
            "[00:27:17,290 --> 00:27:20,580]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:27:20,580 --> 00:27:22,570]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:27:22,570 --> 00:27:26,660]  Our next question is from Goldman Sachs.\n",
            "[00:27:26,660 --> 00:27:28,660]  Hi, thank you for the opportunity.\n",
            "[00:27:28,660 --> 00:27:31,660]  You talked about the reason why data revenue growth rate at Changhua\n",
            "[00:27:31,660 --> 00:27:34,660]  has picked up on the back of that discount going away.\n",
            "[00:27:34,660 --> 00:27:37,660]  Could you shed some light on what's going on with voice revenues\n",
            "[00:27:37,660 --> 00:27:42,660]  where your declines seem to be sharper than those of your competitors\n",
            "[00:27:42,660 --> 00:27:45,660]  in the third quarter in particular?\n",
            "[00:27:45,660 --> 00:27:49,660]  And the second question relates to looking at the earnings\n",
            "[00:27:49,660 --> 00:27:51,660]  in terms of what you've been able to deliver for the third quarter.\n",
            "[00:27:51,660 --> 00:27:55,660]  You're about 7% ahead of where you were thinking you'd be.\n",
            "[00:27:55,660 --> 00:27:57,660]  Could we expect that?\n",
            "[00:27:57,660 --> 00:28:01,660]  Could we forecast a number that's similar to that\n",
            "[00:28:01,660 --> 00:28:06,720]  in terms of where you would end up with a full year?\n",
            "[00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:07,720]  Okay.\n",
            "[00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:10,720]  Regarding your first question about the voice revenue,\n",
            "[00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:15,720]  I just explained that Far East Tone has actually seen ‚Äì\n",
            "[00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:18,720]  actually I think our voice revenue drop rate in the third quarter\n",
            "[00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:21,720]  or eventually if you look at month by month,\n",
            "[00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:24,720]  it's pretty similar to Donghua Telecom recently.\n",
            "[00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:29,720]  So that's why I'm saying that Far East Tone has experienced faster growth\n",
            "[00:28:29,720 --> 00:28:31,720]  on the data revenue.\n",
            "[00:28:31,720 --> 00:28:33,720]  And when customers, their behavior is more mature,\n",
            "[00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:36,720]  we start to see they use less and less voice.\n",
            "[00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:42,720]  I believe the same situation should happen to our competitors later on.\n",
            "[00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:46,720]  So I would not want to say that the Far East Tone,\n",
            "[00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:51,720]  that definitely has seen a serious drop on the voice revenue\n",
            "[00:28:51,720 --> 00:28:53,720]  compared to our competitor.\n",
            "[00:28:53,720 --> 00:28:57,720]  I think it's a different stage of customers who have gone to the data.\n",
            "[00:28:57,720 --> 00:29:01,720]  So this is my straight answer to your question.\n",
            "[00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:10,720]  Is that because it's a greater take-up of apps by your younger audience?\n",
            "[00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:12,720]  Yes, definitely.\n",
            "[00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:15,720]  Because white people are using the data.\n",
            "[00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:19,720]  I think in Taiwan, if you look at the line communication,\n",
            "[00:29:19,720 --> 00:29:22,720]  the user is more than 15 million already.\n",
            "[00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:26,720]  So essentially, no matter if it's young people or even the older people,\n",
            "[00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:29,720]  everybody hooked on to the IP communications.\n",
            "[00:29:29,720 --> 00:29:31,720]  It's just the younger generation,\n",
            "[00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:36,720]  they hook up to this IP communication earlier than whatever,\n",
            "[00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:42,720]  the middle age or the elders on this new communication mechanism.\n",
            "[00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:47,720]  So we certainly believe that from now on,\n",
            "[00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:51,720]  that we probably will continue to see some slight drop on the voice revenue.\n",
            "[00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:58,720]  And the voice revenue eventually will be there,\n",
            "[00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:02,720]  but I think on the monthly fee per se,\n",
            "[00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:07,720]  that the people will be very much used within their monthly fee\n",
            "[00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:09,720]  on the voice revenue part.\n",
            "[00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:11,720]  So this is how we see the future trends.\n",
            "[00:30:11,720 --> 00:30:16,720]  So that's why I think the data revenue will be the future growth driver.\n",
            "[00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:19,720]  So when you look at the combination of voice and data,\n",
            "[00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:21,720]  it's almost as if all the gains that you see in data\n",
            "[00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:24,720]  are getting washed away by losses on voice.\n",
            "[00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:27,720]  And if the mobile app trend continues, as you explain,\n",
            "[00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:29,720]  and it goes through all the age groups,\n",
            "[00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:33,720]  would it be at all possible to generate revenue growth rates\n",
            "[00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:36,720]  that are back the way it used to be, let's say, a year ago?\n",
            "[00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:42,720]  Or are we in a new paradigm with revenue growth rates between 1% and 2%?\n",
            "[00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:49,140]  I think the data growth rate,\n",
            "[00:30:49,140 --> 00:30:53,140]  certainly we are looking at when the 4G is introduced,\n",
            "[00:30:53,140 --> 00:30:55,140]  there will be tier data pricing.\n",
            "[00:30:55,140 --> 00:31:00,140]  So internally, while we are looking into the next three to five years,\n",
            "[00:31:00,140 --> 00:31:06,140]  the top-line growth will continue to be going up a little bit year on year\n",
            "[00:31:06,140 --> 00:31:09,140]  because I think the 4G revenue,\n",
            "[00:31:09,140 --> 00:31:12,140]  certainly when we model it in, it's a tier data pricing.\n",
            "[00:31:12,140 --> 00:31:17,140]  So actually, I keep on saying that I'm optimistic on the top-line growth\n",
            "[00:31:17,140 --> 00:31:22,140]  because the future will be data is the growth driver\n",
            "[00:31:22,140 --> 00:31:26,140]  and the tier pricing on data,\n",
            "[00:31:26,140 --> 00:31:31,140]  we still see that the government will support on this direction.\n",
            "[00:31:31,140 --> 00:31:34,140]  So this is what I'm saying on the data part.\n",
            "[00:31:34,140 --> 00:31:40,140]  But net, I think the top-line revenue will still continue to grow\n",
            "[00:31:40,140 --> 00:31:44,140]  even though that we have seen some drop on the voice revenue.\n",
            "[00:31:44,140 --> 00:31:48,140]  And the good thing is if you look at the Far East Tone's own portfolio,\n",
            "[00:31:48,140 --> 00:31:51,140]  what we have seen is the voice revenue,\n",
            "[00:31:51,140 --> 00:31:54,140]  their dropping trend has been slowing down,\n",
            "[00:31:54,140 --> 00:31:56,140]  which means up to a certain percentage\n",
            "[00:31:56,140 --> 00:32:01,140]  that the customer will still maintain a certain behavior on their voice usage.\n",
            "[00:32:02,140 --> 00:32:05,140]  So that's why in terms of overall picture,\n",
            "[00:32:05,140 --> 00:32:10,510]  I'm still very optimistic of the top-line going forward.\n",
            "[00:32:10,510 --> 00:32:19,590]  On your numbers, what is the third-quarter voice revenue decline year on year?\n",
            "[00:32:19,590 --> 00:32:21,590]  Eight to nine percent.\n",
            "[00:32:21,590 --> 00:32:23,590]  Nine percent, right.\n",
            "[00:32:23,590 --> 00:32:24,590]  Okay.\n",
            "[00:32:24,590 --> 00:32:26,590]  And you think this is going to narrow in the future\n",
            "[00:32:26,590 --> 00:32:30,590]  or can we expect this to be in the high single digits?\n",
            "[00:32:32,010 --> 00:32:35,010]  I think Yvonne just mentioned that it will stabilize.\n",
            "[00:32:35,010 --> 00:32:40,660]  All right, thanks.\n",
            "[00:32:40,660 --> 00:32:41,660]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:32:41,660 --> 00:32:44,660]  As a reminder, please press 01 to ask questions.\n",
            "[00:32:44,660 --> 00:32:49,660]  Our next question is from Standard Chartered Bank, even new.\n",
            "[00:32:49,660 --> 00:32:50,660]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:32:50,660 --> 00:32:51,660]  I have several questions.\n",
            "[00:32:51,660 --> 00:32:59,660]  First, regarding the current 2G and 3G coverage by population and number base station,\n",
            "[00:32:59,660 --> 00:33:04,660]  and in 4G I think maybe it's too early to give guidance on the coverage,\n",
            "[00:33:04,660 --> 00:33:10,660]  but I think can you give some idea about your rollout plan in the first year\n",
            "[00:33:10,660 --> 00:33:13,660]  with the population coverage in the 4G and the second year,\n",
            "[00:33:13,660 --> 00:33:16,660]  just some idea about the population coverage.\n",
            "[00:33:16,660 --> 00:33:23,660]  When we can see the 4G coverage reaching the level we see with the 3G or 2G?\n",
            "[00:33:23,660 --> 00:33:24,660]  That's first question.\n",
            "[00:33:24,660 --> 00:33:30,660]  Second, regarding the ‚Äì can you comment on the recently the new iPhone 5S sales\n",
            "[00:33:30,660 --> 00:33:33,660]  versus the previous iPhone model?\n",
            "[00:33:33,660 --> 00:33:43,660]  And how reliant, I mean, Taiwan telecom markets on the new smartphone like iPhone 5\n",
            "[00:33:43,660 --> 00:33:50,660]  or Samsung, iPhone, how reliant is the Taiwan markets on new subscriber upgrade,\n",
            "[00:33:51,660 --> 00:33:56,660]  I mean, to a certain extent we can see it's really, I mean,\n",
            "[00:33:56,660 --> 00:34:00,660]  it's very important for Taiwan market a new smartphone.\n",
            "[00:34:00,660 --> 00:34:05,660]  And the last question regarding the 2G,\n",
            "[00:34:05,660 --> 00:34:10,660]  do you have any plan to shut down the 2G network when you begin to roll out the 4G?\n",
            "[00:34:10,660 --> 00:34:13,660]  It's a good question.\n",
            "[00:34:13,660 --> 00:34:14,660]  Yes.\n",
            "[00:34:14,660 --> 00:34:15,660]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:34:15,660 --> 00:34:17,070]  Okay.\n",
            "[00:34:17,070 --> 00:34:20,070]  Your first question, I'm sorry that at this stage,\n",
            "[00:34:20,070 --> 00:34:24,070]  let me choose not to share with you on the population coverage.\n",
            "[00:34:24,070 --> 00:34:32,070]  And we do have our internal plan, but wait until the 4G option is finalized\n",
            "[00:34:32,070 --> 00:34:36,070]  because it will deviate a little bit based on contingent about ‚Äì\n",
            "[00:34:36,070 --> 00:34:39,070]  it may not deviate a lot, but it will have some deviation\n",
            "[00:34:39,070 --> 00:34:42,070]  based on which spectrum eventually we will get.\n",
            "[00:34:42,070 --> 00:34:43,070]  Okay.\n",
            "[00:34:43,070 --> 00:34:47,070]  So let me reserve that question until the 4G option is completed.\n",
            "[00:34:47,070 --> 00:34:51,070]  Your second question regarding the iPhone,\n",
            "[00:34:51,070 --> 00:34:59,070]  iPhone this year in terms of the pre-registration volume is certainly lower than before.\n",
            "[00:34:59,070 --> 00:35:02,070]  And not to mention that at this stage,\n",
            "[00:35:02,070 --> 00:35:07,070]  the first batch of the volume that operators received is very limited\n",
            "[00:35:07,070 --> 00:35:13,070]  because what we have seen is that people are at least like 85 percent people\n",
            "[00:35:13,070 --> 00:35:18,070]  registered for iPhone 5S and only 15 percent on the 5C.\n",
            "[00:35:18,070 --> 00:35:24,070]  But the volume we are being allocated by Apple in Taiwan is the other way around.\n",
            "[00:35:24,070 --> 00:35:28,070]  So I think at this stage it's still very difficult to judge\n",
            "[00:35:28,070 --> 00:35:31,070]  whether eventually the overall iPhone 5S series,\n",
            "[00:35:31,070 --> 00:35:36,070]  the sales volume compared to 5 will be eventually like what.\n",
            "[00:35:36,070 --> 00:35:42,070]  But I can only say at this stage the entire market is waiting for the iPhone 5S.\n",
            "[00:35:42,070 --> 00:35:49,070]  5C is being allocated a lot, but the volume being sold is still very, very minimal.\n",
            "[00:35:49,070 --> 00:35:52,070]  So that's the iPhone 5.\n",
            "[00:35:52,070 --> 00:35:55,070]  Your third question regarding the smartphone ‚Äì\n",
            "[00:35:55,070 --> 00:36:00,230]  No, before that there is another question.\n",
            "[00:36:00,230 --> 00:36:04,230]  After the iPhone you have another question, right?\n",
            "[00:36:04,230 --> 00:36:06,230]  Yeah, yeah.\n",
            "[00:36:06,230 --> 00:36:15,230]  How is the Taiwan market reliant on the new smartphones in driving the Apple custom upgrade?\n",
            "[00:36:15,230 --> 00:36:22,610]  This market we rely on the smartphone to drive up the data rate very, very much.\n",
            "[00:36:22,610 --> 00:36:28,610]  Essentially I think smartphone is key to actually drive up the data usage.\n",
            "[00:36:28,610 --> 00:36:31,410]  Is this your question?\n",
            "[00:36:31,410 --> 00:36:34,410]  Yeah, yeah, it's kind of, yeah.\n",
            "[00:36:35,410 --> 00:36:41,410]  And then your fourth question is regarding the sunset of the 2G.\n",
            "[00:36:41,410 --> 00:36:42,410]  Yeah, yeah.\n",
            "[00:36:42,410 --> 00:36:46,630]  I think this will depend on Phil,\n",
            "[00:36:46,630 --> 00:36:52,630]  and I have to say that let's wait, let's reserve this question until the 4G auction is completed\n",
            "[00:36:52,630 --> 00:36:57,630]  because it will also continue upon which spectrum I'm getting.\n",
            "[00:36:57,630 --> 00:37:02,630]  Then I can really finalize the entire 2G plan, all right?\n",
            "[00:37:02,630 --> 00:37:04,630]  Okay, thank you.\n",
            "[00:37:04,630 --> 00:37:06,620]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:37:06,620 --> 00:37:11,420]  Our next question is from Merrill Lynch, Wikileaks.\n",
            "[00:37:11,420 --> 00:37:14,420]  Hi, this is Sydney Zhang from Merrill Lynch.\n",
            "[00:37:14,420 --> 00:37:16,420]  I have two questions.\n",
            "[00:37:16,420 --> 00:37:23,420]  The first question is regarding your 3GB data usage on smartphone per month.\n",
            "[00:37:23,420 --> 00:37:28,420]  What are the most used applications that consume so much data,\n",
            "[00:37:28,420 --> 00:37:33,420]  which is much more than other telcos in the region?\n",
            "[00:37:34,420 --> 00:37:39,420]  The reason I'm asking that question is really when you roll out the tiered pricing,\n",
            "[00:37:39,420 --> 00:37:45,420]  will people really stick to their usage pattern after you increase the price?\n",
            "[00:37:45,420 --> 00:37:50,420]  My second question is on the voice revenue decline.\n",
            "[00:37:50,420 --> 00:37:56,420]  I just wonder what kind of measures you have taken to try to stabilize voice revenue.\n",
            "[00:37:56,420 --> 00:38:02,420]  Are you planning to roll out the flat voice pricing anytime soon?\n",
            "[00:38:02,420 --> 00:38:03,420]  Thanks.\n",
            "[00:38:03,420 --> 00:38:05,420]  Okay.\n",
            "[00:38:05,420 --> 00:38:10,420]  Regarding your first question, of course the top line usage is still on the video.\n",
            "[00:38:10,420 --> 00:38:18,420]  Video is still really driving the entire usage, which is the top line usage.\n",
            "[00:38:18,420 --> 00:38:25,420]  I don't believe that when the tiered pricing is being introduced\n",
            "[00:38:25,420 --> 00:38:28,420]  that the customer will start to use less.\n",
            "[00:38:28,420 --> 00:38:31,420]  I think people, of course, may be more cautious,\n",
            "[00:38:31,420 --> 00:38:34,420]  but because of the 4G speed, it's much better than 3G,\n",
            "[00:38:34,420 --> 00:38:38,420]  so people will tend to use this more.\n",
            "[00:38:38,420 --> 00:38:43,420]  We have to believe this is the nature of the 4G services.\n",
            "[00:38:43,420 --> 00:38:54,220]  I think we basically built our all business case based on the increased consumption\n",
            "[00:38:54,220 --> 00:38:57,220]  on the data usage, particularly onto the 4G.\n",
            "[00:38:57,220 --> 00:38:59,220]  It's also video related.\n",
            "[00:38:59,220 --> 00:39:02,220]  This is relating to your first question.\n",
            "[00:39:02,220 --> 00:39:08,220]  Your second question is relating to stabilizing the voice revenue.\n",
            "[00:39:08,220 --> 00:39:19,220]  As I just said, Forestone has taken action trying to review our overall pricing package at this stage.\n",
            "[00:39:19,220 --> 00:39:23,220]  That's why we have started seeing that in the third quarter,\n",
            "[00:39:23,220 --> 00:39:27,220]  the voice revenue dropping percentage has been stabilized.\n",
            "[00:39:28,220 --> 00:39:34,220]  We are very confident that because of this pricing rate plan review,\n",
            "[00:39:34,220 --> 00:39:43,220]  we have tried to instruct the front line sales to sell only a certain mix of the rate plan.\n",
            "[00:39:43,220 --> 00:39:47,220]  This is the action we are taking out immediately.\n",
            "[00:39:47,220 --> 00:39:51,220]  In terms of whether we are going to introduce the bucket plan,\n",
            "[00:39:51,220 --> 00:39:54,220]  I think the issue will be more complicated than this\n",
            "[00:39:54,220 --> 00:40:00,220]  because Taiwan, by all means, is still a country with a high interconnection rate.\n",
            "[00:40:02,220 --> 00:40:07,220]  That's why I think in Taiwan you haven't really seen any operator really introduce\n",
            "[00:40:07,220 --> 00:40:11,220]  the so-called bucket rate plans on the voice side.\n",
            "[00:40:11,220 --> 00:40:13,220]  It's because of this interconnection.\n",
            "[00:40:15,220 --> 00:40:19,220]  Certainly, this is a direction that we are still looking at.\n",
            "[00:40:20,220 --> 00:40:27,380]  Until a certain stage, I think Taiwan, you may be seeing some kind of a bucket rate plan,\n",
            "[00:40:27,380 --> 00:40:32,380]  but I cannot give you a definite answer at this point in time.\n",
            "[00:40:32,380 --> 00:40:35,380]  It certainly is under evaluation.\n",
            "[00:40:36,380 --> 00:40:39,210]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:40:39,210 --> 00:40:43,210]  Just to add to my first question, I have one additional question.\n",
            "[00:40:44,210 --> 00:40:51,210]  Would you worry about if a new entrant comes in and then just offers a data-owning plan\n",
            "[00:40:51,210 --> 00:40:53,210]  that bypasses the voice?\n",
            "[00:40:53,210 --> 00:41:00,210]  That would let users rely more on just data, lines, those applications.\n",
            "[00:41:00,210 --> 00:41:04,210]  Would that be very disruptive to your voice revenue?\n",
            "[00:41:08,100 --> 00:41:12,100]  Certainly, all these scenarios are being considered\n",
            "[00:41:12,100 --> 00:41:16,100]  when we are considering the potential new entrant move.\n",
            "[00:41:16,100 --> 00:41:21,100]  But I have to say it's also not very, very easy\n",
            "[00:41:21,100 --> 00:41:30,100]  because if you look at Taiwan, that is still like 60% of the revenue is coming from the voice.\n",
            "[00:41:30,100 --> 00:41:38,100]  Particularly on the business segment, people tend to still use the voice call.\n",
            "[00:41:39,100 --> 00:41:44,100]  I don't see that the voice revenue will certainly completely go away,\n",
            "[00:41:44,100 --> 00:41:51,100]  but certainly, I never rule out the possibility that a new entrant may use this very disruptively.\n",
            "[00:41:51,100 --> 00:41:58,100]  Essentially, we also think that in Japan that SoftBank is embracing this thing.\n",
            "[00:41:58,100 --> 00:42:03,100]  But the key thing is when people really move to that stage,\n",
            "[00:42:03,100 --> 00:42:08,100]  there are a few things I remind you to also consider.\n",
            "[00:42:08,100 --> 00:42:12,100]  If you think about the LTE deployment going forward,\n",
            "[00:42:12,100 --> 00:42:20,100]  there are still a bunch of customers that are using the 3G networks.\n",
            "[00:42:20,100 --> 00:42:25,100]  Essentially, people are using the DS4 back.\n",
            "[00:42:25,100 --> 00:42:29,100]  People need to have some kind of voice mechanism.\n",
            "[00:42:29,100 --> 00:42:36,100]  If they're just using the IP, which means they need to have a super coverage,\n",
            "[00:42:36,100 --> 00:42:39,100]  I don't know why, at the very, very beginning.\n",
            "[00:42:39,100 --> 00:42:44,100]  This is not very easy for the new entrant to do.\n",
            "[00:42:44,100 --> 00:42:49,100]  I think although this always will be one consideration\n",
            "[00:42:49,100 --> 00:42:56,190]  that we should not actually worry that much at this society in Taiwan\n",
            "[00:42:56,190 --> 00:43:05,190]  because still, unless the network rollout is tremendously quick to cover the island wide,\n",
            "[00:43:05,190 --> 00:43:12,740]  then the customer will face seriously a network quality issue\n",
            "[00:43:12,740 --> 00:43:16,740]  if they rely on every voice on the IP network.\n",
            "[00:43:16,740 --> 00:43:23,140]  It's not an easy thing.\n",
            "[00:43:23,140 --> 00:43:24,140]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:43:24,140 --> 00:43:26,140]  Yes.\n",
            "[00:43:26,140 --> 00:43:27,420]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:43:27,420 --> 00:43:31,420]  Our next question is from a query.\n",
            "[00:43:31,420 --> 00:43:35,610]  Thanks, Yvonne, and congratulations on the results.\n",
            "[00:43:35,610 --> 00:43:40,610]  It seems that you're doing very well on the EBITDA expansion side of things.\n",
            "[00:43:40,610 --> 00:43:42,610]  I just have two questions.\n",
            "[00:43:42,610 --> 00:43:46,610]  Actually, they're in a way related to the previous caller.\n",
            "[00:43:46,610 --> 00:43:50,610]  In your first regards on the data side,\n",
            "[00:43:50,610 --> 00:43:57,610]  are you seeing at the moment on 3G more or any trends of people moving to data-only plans already\n",
            "[00:43:57,610 --> 00:44:01,610]  that have already been on voice plans and have decided to cut the plans?\n",
            "[00:44:01,610 --> 00:44:04,610]  The reason I'm asking is I'm hearing more of the trend,\n",
            "[00:44:04,610 --> 00:44:09,610]  so I'm just curious how much impact are you seeing the trend among your own subscriber base?\n",
            "[00:44:09,610 --> 00:44:14,610]  And then the second one is a little bit digging deeper into the data trend that you mentioned.\n",
            "[00:44:14,610 --> 00:44:17,610]  With that sharp expansion being driven by video,\n",
            "[00:44:17,610 --> 00:44:23,610]  can you give a little bit more color on exactly what video we're talking about here in terms of driving?\n",
            "[00:44:23,610 --> 00:44:27,610]  Is this sort of the video coming over from the China servers\n",
            "[00:44:27,610 --> 00:44:31,610]  or is it stuff that is being produced locally and being consumed locally?\n",
            "[00:44:31,610 --> 00:44:33,610]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:44:33,610 --> 00:44:35,610]  Okay.\n",
            "[00:44:35,610 --> 00:44:39,610]  Your first question is we have not seen in our base a lot of 3G users.\n",
            "[00:44:39,610 --> 00:44:43,610]  They just stopped using the voice and just using the data.\n",
            "[00:44:43,610 --> 00:44:47,610]  I think the data-only user is more tablet users.\n",
            "[00:44:47,610 --> 00:44:51,610]  So to answer your question, it's very simple.\n",
            "[00:44:51,610 --> 00:44:54,610]  We really see very, very minimum users.\n",
            "[00:44:54,610 --> 00:45:00,610]  Essentially, I see it's never being addressed as one of the issues\n",
            "[00:45:00,610 --> 00:45:03,610]  because right now what we are seeing is the customer,\n",
            "[00:45:03,610 --> 00:45:07,610]  they use their 3G services for voice and data together for smartphone,\n",
            "[00:45:07,610 --> 00:45:09,610]  and tablet is data only.\n",
            "[00:45:09,610 --> 00:45:13,610]  So this is still the phenomenon we are seeing in this local market.\n",
            "[00:45:13,610 --> 00:45:16,610]  Regarding your second question for the video services,\n",
            "[00:45:16,610 --> 00:45:20,610]  I think that the video is half-half\n",
            "[00:45:20,610 --> 00:45:25,900]  because we also have our own video store services offered to our customers.\n",
            "[00:45:25,900 --> 00:45:30,900]  So some of the video, the half of the video is coming from Taiwan,\n",
            "[00:45:30,900 --> 00:45:37,900]  and Taiwan also has a certain video site that the customers are willing to hook onto.\n",
            "[00:45:37,900 --> 00:45:43,900]  For China, there is also a couple of the China video sites\n",
            "[00:45:43,900 --> 00:45:47,900]  that people are willing to see.\n",
            "[00:45:47,900 --> 00:45:50,900]  So on the network side, what we are doing is\n",
            "[00:45:50,900 --> 00:45:53,900]  we're trying to catch some of the service in Taiwan\n",
            "[00:45:53,900 --> 00:46:00,900]  so that it will not actually eat up a lot of the so-called international bandwidth\n",
            "[00:46:00,900 --> 00:46:05,530]  to provide the service to our customers.\n",
            "[00:46:05,530 --> 00:46:07,530]  This is very helpful. Thank you.\n",
            "[00:46:08,530 --> 00:46:14,460]  Thank you. As a reminder, please press 01 to ask questions.\n",
            "[00:46:14,460 --> 00:46:18,460]  Our next question is from HSBC, Leo Anderson.\n",
            "[00:46:18,460 --> 00:46:23,190]  Hi, good afternoon. Sorry, more questions on data.\n",
            "[00:46:23,190 --> 00:46:27,190]  Average usage of 3 gigabytes per month,\n",
            "[00:46:27,190 --> 00:46:30,190]  that's doubled since the fourth quarter of last year.\n",
            "[00:46:30,190 --> 00:46:33,190]  One question I had related to this is,\n",
            "[00:46:33,190 --> 00:46:38,190]  is this average distorted by a small number of very heavy users\n",
            "[00:46:38,190 --> 00:46:41,190]  taking advantage of the current flat rate data plans,\n",
            "[00:46:41,190 --> 00:46:43,190]  or is it more broad-based?\n",
            "[00:46:43,190 --> 00:46:45,190]  I remember in, say, some other markets,\n",
            "[00:46:45,190 --> 00:46:51,190]  operators commented that around 5% of users were generating 80%, 90% of traffic\n",
            "[00:46:51,190 --> 00:46:54,190]  before tiered pricing came in.\n",
            "[00:46:54,190 --> 00:46:56,190]  That was my first question.\n",
            "[00:46:56,190 --> 00:46:59,190]  A couple of questions relating to the network.\n",
            "[00:46:59,190 --> 00:47:02,190]  Again, back in the first quarter, you said you were planning to add,\n",
            "[00:47:02,190 --> 00:47:05,190]  I think, 1,000 new cell sites this year.\n",
            "[00:47:06,190 --> 00:47:10,190]  I just wondered if I could get an update on how you were tracking on that.\n",
            "[00:47:10,190 --> 00:47:15,190]  And finally, you mentioned previously that you felt your 3G capacity\n",
            "[00:47:15,190 --> 00:47:18,190]  was adequate until 2015.\n",
            "[00:47:18,190 --> 00:47:24,190]  Are you at all surprised by the rate of increase of the smartphone traffic,\n",
            "[00:47:24,190 --> 00:47:28,190]  and do you still feel comfortable with that 2015 capacity estimate?\n",
            "[00:47:28,190 --> 00:47:31,220]  Thanks very much.\n",
            "[00:47:31,220 --> 00:47:34,220]  Let me answer your first question.\n",
            "[00:47:34,220 --> 00:47:40,220]  Indeed, the per-user usage has increased significantly versus a year ago.\n",
            "[00:47:40,220 --> 00:47:43,220]  But we also did a lot of international benchmark,\n",
            "[00:47:43,220 --> 00:47:49,220]  and globally we are seeing a lot of operators who are experiencing\n",
            "[00:47:49,220 --> 00:47:52,220]  triple-digit data traffic growth.\n",
            "[00:47:52,220 --> 00:47:59,260]  In fact, GSMA organization forecast that for the next five years,\n",
            "[00:47:59,260 --> 00:48:03,260]  the data traffic is going to grow more than 15 times.\n",
            "[00:48:05,060 --> 00:48:14,350]  Related to this question, your other question is about whether we are seeing\n",
            "[00:48:14,350 --> 00:48:18,580]  5% of users using 80% or 90%.\n",
            "[00:48:18,580 --> 00:48:22,580]  Indeed, there are some users who use tremendously more.\n",
            "[00:48:22,580 --> 00:48:27,580]  But in our case, we believe the situation is more like 10% of the users\n",
            "[00:48:27,580 --> 00:48:31,580]  are using somewhere between 50% to 60%.\n",
            "[00:48:31,580 --> 00:48:37,100]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:48:37,100 --> 00:48:41,640]  And then on the network side.\n",
            "[00:48:41,640 --> 00:48:43,640]  Capacity.\n",
            "[00:48:43,640 --> 00:48:47,640]  We are confident our capacity is more than enough.\n",
            "[00:48:47,640 --> 00:48:50,640]  And as we shared in the presentation,\n",
            "[00:48:50,640 --> 00:48:57,640]  NCC commissioned an organization to do a speed test throughout Taiwan,\n",
            "[00:48:57,640 --> 00:49:00,640]  and FET overall came out on top.\n",
            "[00:49:00,640 --> 00:49:03,640]  So we are in good shape.\n",
            "[00:49:03,640 --> 00:49:11,140]  Okay, thank you.\n",
            "[00:49:11,140 --> 00:49:12,140]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:49:12,140 --> 00:49:14,140]  Our next question is from Morgan Stanley.\n",
            "[00:49:14,140 --> 00:49:16,140]  Gary Yu.\n",
            "[00:49:16,140 --> 00:49:17,300]  Hi, good afternoon.\n",
            "[00:49:17,300 --> 00:49:19,300]  Thank you for the opportunity to ask questions.\n",
            "[00:49:19,300 --> 00:49:23,300]  One follow-up question on your voice revenue decline.\n",
            "[00:49:23,300 --> 00:49:25,300]  You mentioned that going forward,\n",
            "[00:49:25,300 --> 00:49:29,300]  you expect customers will mainly pay for the monthly fee\n",
            "[00:49:29,300 --> 00:49:33,300]  without breaching their voice allowance.\n",
            "[00:49:33,300 --> 00:49:36,300]  If I look at your current voice revenue,\n",
            "[00:49:36,300 --> 00:49:41,300]  what is the percentage of revenue coming from monthly fee,\n",
            "[00:49:41,300 --> 00:49:44,300]  and what is the percentage of revenue coming from customers\n",
            "[00:49:44,300 --> 00:49:49,300]  paying on a per-minute basis when they breach their voice minute allowance?\n",
            "[00:49:49,300 --> 00:49:53,300]  Second question is on 4G value chain.\n",
            "[00:49:53,300 --> 00:50:00,300]  Given we in Taiwan are going to do some of the 4G on 700 megahertz band,\n",
            "[00:50:00,300 --> 00:50:06,300]  when do you expect the value chain of 4G to become more mature in this particular band?\n",
            "[00:50:06,300 --> 00:50:10,300]  And particularly when do you expect more smartphone handsets\n",
            "[00:50:10,300 --> 00:50:13,300]  to be compatible with 700 megahertz?\n",
            "[00:50:13,300 --> 00:50:16,300]  And last question on CapEx.\n",
            "[00:50:16,300 --> 00:50:21,300]  I know a large part of the CapEx will be decided only when you see the outcome\n",
            "[00:50:21,300 --> 00:50:23,300]  of the 4G spectrum auction.\n",
            "[00:50:23,300 --> 00:50:27,300]  But if I look at your guidance of 10% to 12% of revenue,\n",
            "[00:50:27,300 --> 00:50:32,300]  this year we are already reaching the high end of 12%.\n",
            "[00:50:32,300 --> 00:50:36,300]  And given we have seen some slowdown in top line growth,\n",
            "[00:50:36,300 --> 00:50:43,300]  do you see upside risk even to these 12% of revenue guidance going into next year?\n",
            "[00:50:43,300 --> 00:50:45,300]  Thank you very much.\n",
            "[00:50:45,300 --> 00:50:47,550]  Okay.\n",
            "[00:50:47,550 --> 00:50:52,550]  Your first question and the third question, I'll leave it to TY to answer your question.\n",
            "[00:50:52,550 --> 00:50:58,550]  And your second question is regarding the 700, the ecosystem's readiness.\n",
            "[00:50:58,550 --> 00:51:05,550]  And based on our current understanding, we do not see,\n",
            "[00:51:05,550 --> 00:51:07,550]  particularly on the network equipment side,\n",
            "[00:51:07,550 --> 00:51:14,550]  I think the ecosystems will be ready very, very soon, hopefully by end of this year.\n",
            "[00:51:14,550 --> 00:51:20,550]  And on the device side, I think in the first half of the next year,\n",
            "[00:51:20,550 --> 00:51:28,550]  there will be certain devices that can be run on the 700 systems.\n",
            "[00:51:28,550 --> 00:51:34,550]  Of course, in terms of device number, you cannot still compete with the 1800,\n",
            "[00:51:34,550 --> 00:51:42,550]  which right now is still considered a major band internationally for the LTE.\n",
            "[00:51:42,550 --> 00:51:48,550]  But in terms of the value chain ecosystem, I think the first half of next year,\n",
            "[00:51:48,550 --> 00:51:51,550]  I think both on the device side and the network equipment side,\n",
            "[00:51:51,550 --> 00:51:55,550]  we can see something coming out on the market.\n",
            "[00:51:55,550 --> 00:51:57,550]  Not an issue.\n",
            "[00:51:57,550 --> 00:52:05,540]  Your question concerning the breakup of the voice revenue between monthly fee\n",
            "[00:52:05,540 --> 00:52:11,540]  as well as the excess charge, I would have to take it offline and get back to you.\n",
            "[00:52:11,540 --> 00:52:14,540]  And your third question on CAT-X guidance,\n",
            "[00:52:15,540 --> 00:52:22,540]  indeed, 2013, our CAT-X guidance is about 11.7% of our total revenue,\n",
            "[00:52:22,540 --> 00:52:26,540]  which is a tad higher than the previous two years.\n",
            "[00:52:26,540 --> 00:52:32,540]  But again, our 4G CAT-X would be contingent upon which blocks we are getting.\n",
            "[00:52:32,540 --> 00:52:38,540]  So we'd rather wait until the auction is complete and then commit.\n",
            "[00:52:38,540 --> 00:52:47,980]  Okay, thank you very much.\n",
            "[00:52:47,980 --> 00:52:48,980]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:52:48,980 --> 00:52:53,980]  As a reminder, please press 01 on your telephone keypad to ask a question.\n",
            "[00:52:53,980 --> 00:53:00,500]  Our next question is from Credit Suisse, Checkman.\n",
            "[00:53:00,500 --> 00:53:05,500]  Some follow-up questions from me on the topic on the peer pricing.\n",
            "[00:53:05,500 --> 00:53:10,500]  I understand that you make the earlier comment that you may be replacing unlimited\n",
            "[00:53:10,500 --> 00:53:16,500]  give or take with 5G plan seems like an appropriate level.\n",
            "[00:53:16,500 --> 00:53:19,500]  Any update thought on that?\n",
            "[00:53:19,500 --> 00:53:22,500]  Should we still be looking at like a 5G instead of unlimited?\n",
            "[00:53:22,500 --> 00:53:26,500]  Or what's your view on implementation of peer pricing exactly?\n",
            "[00:53:26,500 --> 00:53:31,500]  And the second part of the question is, with this peer pricing,\n",
            "[00:53:31,500 --> 00:53:34,500]  is there any room to implement that also on 3G service,\n",
            "[00:53:34,500 --> 00:53:37,500]  meaning just remove the unlimited offers completely?\n",
            "[00:53:37,500 --> 00:53:42,500]  Or do you think that on 3G, at least, if some users choose to remain on 3G,\n",
            "[00:53:42,500 --> 00:53:45,500]  that could still be room for them to actually choose unlimited?\n",
            "[00:53:45,500 --> 00:53:47,500]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:53:47,500 --> 00:53:48,500]  Okay.\n",
            "[00:53:48,500 --> 00:53:54,500]  Regarding the 3G, we will be able to take away the fly rate.\n",
            "[00:53:54,500 --> 00:53:59,500]  The answer is very, very difficult because this is still under the regulation.\n",
            "[00:53:59,500 --> 00:54:05,500]  So it will be difficult for every operator eventually to take away the fly rate in the 3G.\n",
            "[00:54:05,500 --> 00:54:12,500]  But for 4G, you are asking about the peer data rate pricing design.\n",
            "[00:54:12,500 --> 00:54:19,500]  I think while we are looking at the design, it can be all the way from 1 GHz and above\n",
            "[00:54:19,500 --> 00:54:22,500]  and can be 10, 15, 20.\n",
            "[00:54:22,500 --> 00:54:25,500]  That's all under the design.\n",
            "[00:54:25,500 --> 00:54:29,500]  The thing is we want to let the customers have their own choices\n",
            "[00:54:29,500 --> 00:54:33,500]  which one of the buckets they prefer to choose.\n",
            "[00:54:34,500 --> 00:54:39,500]  Of course, we have not finalized what will be the ceiling to be given to the customer\n",
            "[00:54:39,500 --> 00:54:42,500]  and whether to reach that ceiling,\n",
            "[00:54:42,500 --> 00:54:47,500]  Taiwan will eventually allow the fair usage when reaching certain ceilings.\n",
            "[00:54:47,500 --> 00:54:51,500]  So all of these things, I think right after the 4G auction,\n",
            "[00:54:51,500 --> 00:54:56,500]  there will still be something that either needs to be communicated\n",
            "[00:54:56,500 --> 00:54:59,500]  or needs to be detailed design.\n",
            "[00:54:59,500 --> 00:55:04,500]  So we will get back to you when we launch the 4G commercial services\n",
            "[00:55:04,500 --> 00:55:08,500]  and you will know that our detail design.\n",

            "[00:13:49,780 --> 00:13:55,780]  million negative EBITDA range that we talked about in the last conference call. Okay?\n",
            "[00:13:55,780 --> 00:14:01,780]  And with regard to your second question which is about the Q1 performance on the fixed line\n",
            "[00:14:01,780 --> 00:14:08,780]  side, indeed we take note that the year-on-year growth of the top line from the fixed line\n",
            "[00:14:08,780 --> 00:14:17,780]  was slowing a little bit in Q1 which is driven primarily by international voice traffic\n",
            "[00:14:17,780 --> 00:14:23,780]  business. Yeah. And so very happy to share with you that if you do a calculation you\n",
            "[00:14:23,780 --> 00:14:29,780]  can see that the EBITDA dollar is actually very little impacted because those international\n",
            "[00:14:29,780 --> 00:14:36,780]  voice traffic has very little margin in the first place. And your third question, indeed\n",
            "[00:14:36,780 --> 00:14:43,780]  we outperformed our Q1 guidance. But at this point in time I think all we can say is that\n",
            "[00:14:43,780 --> 00:14:49,780]  definitely we are going to take one quarter at a time and execute the best that we could.\n",
            "[00:14:49,780 --> 00:14:55,780]  Yeah. And whether there is going to be upside we don't know and we are not committed to\n",
            "[00:14:55,780 --> 00:15:01,780]  anything yet. Yeah. The only thing we are committed to is every quarter we want to ensure\n",
            "[00:15:01,780 --> 00:15:04,780]  that we have the best execution.\n",
            "[00:15:04,780 --> 00:15:09,000]  That is great. Just two follow-up questions from me. The first question is regarding the\n",
            "[00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:16,000]  fixed line. So you see a revenue acceleration into a second quarter or what is your expectation\n",
            "[00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:20,000]  or actually we should still continue to see the softness coming in from this international\n",
            "[00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:26,000]  voice traffic business. The second follow-up is actually related to the average smartphone\n",
            "[00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:32,000]  Apple. You disclosed that it is more than 1,500 but compared to fourth quarter you say\n",
            "[00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:37,000]  it is around 1,400. So is there anything to read into that or actually it is just stable\n",
            "[00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:41,000]  or is there actually an improvement in that? Thank you.\n",
            "[00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:51,000]  Okay. The international voice traffic downtrend I think that is going to carry over into the\n",
            "[00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:59,000]  future quarter. Our enterprise team is working very hard to compensate for this in other\n",
            "[00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:08,000]  areas of the business. So we are still committed to the guidance that our enterprise business\n",
            "[00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:12,000]  should grow top line 10% year over year.\n",
            "[00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:27,580]  The smartphone Apple is higher because the 1,500 is calculated based upon a 37% penetration.\n",
            "[00:16:28,580 --> 00:16:38,920]  Previously when we communicated the smartphone Apple we were using penetration and what we\n",
            "[00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:48,410]  found in this quarter is actually users and we filter out those smartphone users who did\n",
            "[00:16:48,410 --> 00:17:00,910]  not have, became smaller. Smartphone users they do contribute higher output. So there\n",
            "[00:17:00,910 --> 00:17:06,910]  was a difference in the calculation between the 1,500 and the 1,400 that was previously\n",
            "[00:17:06,910 --> 00:17:07,910]  communicated.\n",
            "[00:17:07,910 --> 00:17:11,910]  Okay. Like for like it is fairly stable.\n",
            "[00:17:11,910 --> 00:17:12,940]  Yes.\n",
            "[00:17:12,940 --> 00:17:14,940]  Thank you very much.\n",
            "[00:17:14,940 --> 00:17:22,380]  Thank you sir for your questions. We now have a question from Vicky Lim from Maryland.\n",
            "[00:17:22,380 --> 00:17:23,380]  Please go ahead Vicky.\n",
            "[00:17:23,380 --> 00:17:30,380]  Hi Manjun this is Sydney Zhang from Maryland. I have just one question. Regarding you have\n",
            "[00:17:30,380 --> 00:17:37,380]  this high dividend payment and also in light of towards the end of the year you also need\n",
            "[00:17:37,380 --> 00:17:44,380]  to pay some minimum payment to the government for the 4G license and then the next year\n",
            "[00:17:44,380 --> 00:17:50,380]  is you know CAPEX. Do you need to borrow more money this year and can you you know\n",
            "[00:17:50,380 --> 00:17:54,380]  give us an idea on the cash flow issues? Thanks.\n",
            "[00:17:54,380 --> 00:18:02,380]  Okay. Good question. Yeah. In this morning for FEP board meeting the board also approved\n",
            "[00:18:03,380 --> 00:18:12,380]  for FEP management to go out and issue corporate bonds not to exceed 10 billion NT dollars.\n",
            "[00:18:12,380 --> 00:18:23,610]  Yeah. So definitely when we plan for the dividend distribution this year we took into our consideration\n",
            "[00:18:23,610 --> 00:18:29,610]  all those future cash needs. Yeah. And primarily the 4G licensing.\n",
            "[00:18:29,610 --> 00:18:32,980]  Okay. Thank you.\n",
            "[00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:39,040]  Thank you sir. Currently we have no further questions in the queue. Just to remind all\n",
            "[00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:45,040]  participants if you would like to ask a question please press 0 then 1 on your telephone keypad.\n",
            "[00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:51,710]  So that is 0 then 1 on your telephone keypad. And we have a follow-up question from Jake\n",
            "[00:18:51,710 --> 00:18:53,710]  Ben from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead sir.\n",
            "[00:18:53,710 --> 00:19:00,710]  Okay. If you do not mind I just have one more question on the dividend payout. So I understand\n",
            "[00:19:00,710 --> 00:19:06,710]  that the payout this year is around 108% so it is quite consistent with last year.\n",
            "[00:19:06,710 --> 00:19:13,710]  So you still commit to the payout of at least 100% and in light of all the CAPEX and other\n",
            "[00:19:13,710 --> 00:19:19,710]  financial commitments would you prefer to still keep the dividend payout basically consistent\n",
            "[00:19:19,710 --> 00:19:26,710]  or actually you can actually cut it back to 100% or what is your view on that? Thank you.\n",
            "[00:19:27,710 --> 00:19:35,710]  I think we have said it for almost two years now our dividend policy is at least 100% in\n",
            "[00:19:35,710 --> 00:19:43,710]  the absence of major M&A. So clearly a quarter ago one of you raised that question to our\n",
            "[00:19:43,710 --> 00:19:49,710]  President Yvonne whether 4G licensing is going to have an impact on our dividend distribution.\n",
            "[00:19:49,710 --> 00:19:55,710]  Yeah. And so today this is a demonstration that we took all those into our consideration\n",
            "[00:19:55,710 --> 00:20:00,710]  and definitely 4G licensing is not going to have an impact on our dividend distribution\n",
            "[00:20:00,710 --> 00:20:08,710]  policy. And going forward at this point in time we still believe the 4G CAPEX will be\n",
            "[00:20:08,710 --> 00:20:16,710]  within the 10% to 12% of total revenue that we have guided and we do not see any reason\n",
            "[00:20:16,710 --> 00:20:19,710]  to change that guidance at this point in time.\n",
            "[00:20:19,710 --> 00:20:24,310]  Noted. Thank you.\n",
            "[00:20:24,310 --> 00:20:28,310]  Thank you, sir. We now have a question from Neil Anderson from HSBC.\n",
            "[00:20:29,790 --> 00:20:34,790]  Hi. Good afternoon. Just three questions around the area of data traffic, data usage. Can\n",
            "[00:20:34,790 --> 00:20:38,790]  you update us on the monthly trends you are seeing from both your smartphone customers\n",
            "[00:20:38,790 --> 00:20:45,790]  and your data device customers? And secondly I wanted to ask about current investment trends\n",
            "[00:20:45,790 --> 00:20:50,790]  in the network. What are you focusing on? I presume it is urban areas and improving\n",
            "[00:20:50,790 --> 00:20:56,790]  coverage but can you give us any update there? And finally just to check on whether\n",
            "[00:20:56,790 --> 00:21:02,790]  the NCC is still assuming that tiered data plans will come in with 4G say early next\n",
            "[00:21:02,790 --> 00:21:06,790]  year just to check if that is still the current thinking. Thanks very much.\n",
            "[00:21:07,790 --> 00:21:13,790]  Okay. On your first question on data traffic as for smart device users, yeah, actually\n",
            "[00:21:14,790 --> 00:21:21,790]  when we did deep dive into our database for the past three years, every month we have\n",
            "[00:21:21,790 --> 00:21:28,790]  been consistently adding a very similar number of smartphone users and therefore if you go\n",
            "[00:21:28,790 --> 00:21:36,790]  back to as far back as three years ago, almost every month the incremental mobile data revenue\n",
            "[00:21:37,790 --> 00:21:41,790]  was a very consistent magnitude.\n",
            "[00:21:44,790 --> 00:21:49,790]  Sorry. My question was more about the traffic those customers are generating. Are you seeing\n",
            "[00:21:49,790 --> 00:21:51,790]  any change Q and Q in that?\n",
            "[00:21:52,790 --> 00:21:58,790]  Yeah. And I am coming back to that. Yeah. The traffic trend that we are seeing in our\n",
            "[00:21:58,790 --> 00:22:03,790]  network is actually very consistent with the international trend. Yeah. I cannot share\n",
            "[00:22:03,790 --> 00:22:09,790]  with you how does this impact month over month. However, when we track a longer period\n",
            "[00:22:09,790 --> 00:22:18,790]  of time, year over year, the growth rate has always been 100% plus or minus 10% which is\n",
            "[00:22:18,790 --> 00:22:22,790]  very consistent with the international benchmark that we are monitoring.\n",
            "[00:22:27,020 --> 00:22:28,020]  Okay. Thank you.\n",
            "[00:22:28,020 --> 00:22:35,020]  Regarding your second question about the network investment trend, so are you mentioning about\n",
            "[00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:43,020]  the amount that we are going to put into or in terms of whether the WCDMA was the next\n",
            "[00:22:43,020 --> 00:22:49,020]  generation of the technology we are going to put in or are we planning to do any LTE\n",
            "[00:22:49,020 --> 00:22:54,020]  kind of a preparation? I am not quite sure that I understand your question fully.\n",
            "[00:22:55,020 --> 00:22:59,020]  Sure. It was more about where those investment dollars are going. So I remember recently\n",
            "[00:22:59,020 --> 00:23:04,020]  you were adding more carriers to the existing base stations. I was wondering if you are\n",
            "[00:23:04,020 --> 00:23:09,020]  now adding more cell sites, maybe improving in-building coverage. And I assume that most\n",
            "[00:23:09,020 --> 00:23:13,020]  of that would be around HSPA at the moment. So that was what I was looking to get some\n",
            "[00:23:13,020 --> 00:23:14,020]  color on.\n",
            "[00:23:15,020 --> 00:23:23,020]  Okay. Then this year that we certainly continue to increase some of the coverage, particularly\n",
            "[00:23:23,020 --> 00:23:30,020]  like you said that for some in-store coverage improvement that this year we are planning\n",
            "[00:23:30,020 --> 00:23:37,020]  to add on close to 1,000 new sites, which is already incorporated into our CAPEX guidance\n",
            "[00:23:37,020 --> 00:23:44,020]  for this year. Regarding the carrier, right now how many percentage of our cell sites\n",
            "[00:23:44,020 --> 00:23:46,020]  have installed the third carrier?\n",
            "[00:23:47,020 --> 00:23:48,020]  Close to 80%.\n",
            "[00:23:48,020 --> 00:23:55,020]  So right now close to 80% of our cell sites are already equipped with the third carrier\n",
            "[00:23:55,020 --> 00:24:03,020]  capabilities, which is also put into our CAPEX guidance for this year. So we will continue\n",
            "[00:24:03,020 --> 00:24:12,020]  to expand the capacity when needed and for our whatever the core, which I think it will\n",
            "[00:24:12,020 --> 00:24:19,020]  be next. This year our core has already expanded from 40G to 60G. So all this has been done\n",
            "[00:24:19,020 --> 00:24:24,020]  and incorporated into whatever the network expansion plan for this year.\n",
            "[00:24:25,020 --> 00:24:33,020]  Your next question regarding the 4G, whether our regulatory authority will entertain this\n",
            "[00:24:33,020 --> 00:24:42,020]  so-called tier pricing. I can only say that at this stage I'm optimistic that they will\n",
            "[00:24:43,020 --> 00:24:49,020]  eventually allow us to do the tier pricing plan. But of course with this tier pricing\n",
            "[00:24:49,020 --> 00:24:57,500]  kind of concept, we also need to have quite a, I would say consistent movement in this\n",
            "[00:24:57,500 --> 00:25:03,500]  local market. Then there is a bigger chance for success. But in terms of the regulatory\n",
            "[00:25:03,500 --> 00:25:11,500]  attitude, at this stage I do not see any negative sign that they will disallow on this future\n",
            "[00:25:11,500 --> 00:25:12,500]  direction.\n",
            "[00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:14,790]  That's great. Thank you very much.\n",
            "[00:25:15,790 --> 00:25:16,790]  Okay. Yeah.\n",
            "[00:25:18,590 --> 00:25:22,590]  Thank you, Neil. Our next question comes from Stephen Liu from Standard Chiba Bank. Please\n",

            "[00:25:24,590 --> 00:25:28,590]  Okay. Thank you. I have several questions. The first regarding the short message. We\n",
            "[00:25:28,590 --> 00:25:33,590]  know in China, like China Mobile, there's another threat from the OTT provider in the\n",
            "[00:25:33,590 --> 00:25:39,590]  short message coming down very rapidly. What is the situation in Taiwan is the first question.\n",
            "[00:25:40,590 --> 00:25:45,590]  The second question regarding total capex, I think you may be able to get a 4G license\n",
            "[00:25:45,590 --> 00:25:52,590]  by the end of the year and start 4G investment. I mean, can you give me some idea about the\n",
            "[00:25:52,590 --> 00:25:59,590]  total capex when you begin to roll out 4G? I mean, could you reduce the 3G capex when\n",
            "[00:25:59,590 --> 00:26:02,590]  you begin to roll out 4G? It's the second question.\n",
            "[00:26:03,590 --> 00:26:08,590]  Third, regarding the Wi-Fi, actually we look at other markets like in China, Europe, Wi-Fi\n",
            "[00:26:08,590 --> 00:26:15,590]  has been increasingly offloading the data traffic. What is the situation in Taiwan and\n",
            "[00:26:15,590 --> 00:26:19,590]  what percentage of traffic was offloaded through Wi-Fi?\n",
            "[00:26:19,590 --> 00:26:26,590]  And last question regarding the handset sales network channels. I mean, what percentage\n",
            "[00:26:26,590 --> 00:26:33,590]  of handset sales for your own shops and what percentage from the open retail shops? Thank\n",
            "[00:26:33,590 --> 00:26:35,590]  you. Four questions. Yeah.\n",
            "[00:26:36,590 --> 00:26:43,590]  Okay. I just want to clarify your last question. You are asking that our device sales, how\n",
            "[00:26:43,590 --> 00:26:49,590]  many percentage is sold by our own channel and how many are sold through the open channel,\n",

            "[00:27:01,620 --> 00:27:08,620]  is about 15% here in Taiwan. I think that trend should be quite consistent with the\n",
            "[00:27:08,620 --> 00:27:14,620]  countries where the smartphone take-up rate is getting higher and higher. So that's our\n",
            "[00:27:14,620 --> 00:27:21,620]  short message. In terms of the 4G license, whether you will increase our total capex,\n",
            "[00:27:21,620 --> 00:27:28,660]  I think we already guided that we will still, I think the total capex after we got the 4G\n",
            "[00:27:28,660 --> 00:27:34,660]  license, the investment will still be within 10 to 12% of our total revenue. So we do\n",
            "[00:27:34,660 --> 00:27:40,660]  not see that with the 4G coming in, the capex will simply increase. Of course, when we start\n",
            "[00:27:40,660 --> 00:27:46,660]  to deploy 4G, the investment on the current WCDN network, we're getting less and less.\n",
            "[00:27:46,660 --> 00:27:53,880]  That's for sure. Wi-Fi, so the overall percentage is still very low. It's slightly below 5%\n",
            "[00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:59,880]  here, at least for Farrington's network. And certainly we are seeing the trend that going\n",
            "[00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:05,880]  forward, that overall network planning will include the LTE, LTE advanced, and the Wi-Fi\n",
            "[00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:12,880]  will be a total network component. And so definitely that Farrington is also looking at this\n",

            "[00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:39,880]  the understanding, the percentage of the selling through our own channel is very, very\n",
            "[00:28:39,880 --> 00:28:44,880]  high. It's much higher than the open channel. Because in Taiwan, the open channel majority\n",
            "[00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:53,880]  is still selling those feature phones because it's still like a much more entry-level market.\n",

            "[00:00:49,990 --> 00:00:54,990]  And we will try everything to make this conference call effectively today.\n",

            "[00:01:19,990 --> 00:01:30,990]  and a good Chinese New Year holiday. And then I'll quickly start the Far Eastone Q4 2012 results conference.\n",
            "[00:01:30,990 --> 00:01:36,990]  We'll start with the market overview. If you look at the overall Taiwan mobile market,\n",
            "[00:01:36,990 --> 00:01:43,990]  that the mobile service revenue that Far Eastone has continued to grow above the peers,\n",
            "[00:01:43,990 --> 00:01:53,990]  that our mobile service revenue is growing like 5.8% quarter after quarter, like comparing 2012 and 2011.\n",
            "[00:01:53,990 --> 00:02:00,990]  And the data revenue growth is accounted 40.4% for last year.\n",
            "[00:02:00,990 --> 00:02:08,990]  I think the most important factor for Far Eastone that we continue to look at is overall the mobile service revenue share.\n",
            "[00:02:08,990 --> 00:02:13,990]  And we are happy to report that last year, that for the entire year,\n",
            "[00:02:13,990 --> 00:02:23,620]  our mobile service revenue is actually growing the most among all the operators in Taiwan.\n",
            "[00:02:23,620 --> 00:02:27,620]  Then I'll quickly come into our own operational performance.\n",
            "[00:02:27,620 --> 00:02:32,620]  I think everything comes down to a good solid customer number growth.\n",
            "[00:02:32,620 --> 00:02:40,620]  So last year, Far Eastone, we grew 4.9% on year-on-year basis up to, right now,\n",
            "[00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:46,620]  our accumulated subscriber has reached 6.9 million subscribers.\n",
            "[00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:55,140]  Out of this, that 22% is the prepaid customer and the remaining is the postpaid customer.\n",
            "[00:02:55,140 --> 00:03:01,140]  Along with the customer growth, that the overall traffic continues to grow.\n",
            "[00:03:01,140 --> 00:03:07,140]  It's essentially 5.2% on a year-on-year growth in the fourth quarter.\n",
            "[00:03:07,140 --> 00:03:15,140]  And another very good thing is that our pool is also continuing to grow,\n",
            "[00:03:15,140 --> 00:03:20,140]  despite of all the negative regulatory impact for 2012.\n",
            "[00:03:20,140 --> 00:03:29,900]  Financial performances, I think you can see the graph is a very solid quarter after quarter growth.\n",
            "[00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:42,210]  Our total revenue is growing 15% on year-on-year basis and our service revenue is 8% year-on-year growth.\n",
            "[00:03:42,210 --> 00:03:51,210]  All the way from the top line down to the bottom line, we are reporting quite a good result for the entire 2012.\n",
            "[00:03:51,210 --> 00:03:57,210]  Our consolidated service revenue is growing 7.9% on a year-on-year basis.\n",
            "[00:03:57,210 --> 00:04:04,210]  And EBITDA 8.4% growth, net income 19.4%, which means we are not only growing the top line,\n",
            "[00:04:04,210 --> 00:04:08,210]  but we are also controlling to control our cost effectively,\n",
            "[00:04:08,210 --> 00:04:16,780]  so that our overall EBITDA growth percentage is a lot higher than the service revenue.\n",
            "[00:04:16,780 --> 00:04:23,780]  Of course, all the growth, I think the key growth drivers is coming from the mobile data.\n",
            "[00:04:23,780 --> 00:04:33,780]  And up to the end of last year, we continue to see that at least 1% up on the total so-called data penetration rate.\n",
            "[00:04:33,780 --> 00:04:40,780]  So our year-on-year mobile data growth is reported as a 44.3% growth.\n",
            "[00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:48,870]  Our data service revenue versus our subscriber pays right now at the end of last year is 44% of our total post-paid subs.\n",
            "[00:04:48,870 --> 00:04:51,870]  It's actually getting a data rate plan.\n",
            "[00:04:51,870 --> 00:05:02,820]  On the overall financial performance against the guidance that we put forward at the early of last year,\n",
            "[00:05:02,820 --> 00:05:09,820]  you can see that essentially all the way from the top line, the revenue, down to the bottom line for the net income,\n",
            "[00:05:09,820 --> 00:05:16,160]  we outperformed our guidance.\n",
            "[00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:22,160]  Balance sheet, we continue to have a very, very strong balance sheet.\n",
            "[00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:26,160]  The net cash position is above $14 billion.\n",
            "[00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:33,640]  And the free cash flow we generated for last year is $14.8 billion.\n",
            "[00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:42,270]  And the cash-based capex is about $8.7 billion, which is within our guidance.\n",
            "[00:05:42,270 --> 00:05:48,270]  I think that all the strong data growth is driven by the smart devices uptake.\n",
            "[00:05:48,270 --> 00:05:56,270]  Right now, all the smart devices is accounting 87% of our total new devices sold in the fourth quarter.\n",
            "[00:05:56,270 --> 00:06:03,270]  And our smartphone penetration has reached 42% against our total post-paid subs,\n",
            "[00:06:03,270 --> 00:06:09,270]  which I think for this, we only count iOS and Android only.\n",
            "[00:06:09,270 --> 00:06:15,270]  The good thing is that the smartphone output is holding up quite okay.\n",
            "[00:06:15,270 --> 00:06:21,270]  So right now, the average output is still at around 1,400 range.\n",
            "[00:06:21,270 --> 00:06:31,880]  And our smartphone penetration rate at the end of last year, I just mentioned, has reached 42%.\n",
            "[00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:36,880]  Very quickly, after I reported last year's performance,\n",
            "[00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:41,880]  I'll put forward the guidance for 2013 this year.\n",
            "[00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:50,880]  Our total revenue, we actually forecast to be 3% growth on a year-on-year basis,\n",
            "[00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:54,880]  which will be close to $89.7 billion.\n",
            "[00:06:54,880 --> 00:07:01,880]  And we are forecasting a 4% service revenue growth on a year-on-year basis.\n",
            "[00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:09,880]  This is already factoring in the potential regulatory impact on the mobile combination\n",
            "[00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:16,880]  and probably some of the added value on the prepaid and postpaid side.\n",
            "[00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:23,880]  We continue to want to control our costs and continue to improve our cost efficiency.\n",
            "[00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:31,880]  So our EBITDA is targeted to grow 5%, which reached $25.6 billion this year.\n",
            "[00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:37,880]  Our EBITDA percentage will have a slight improvement to 28.5%.\n",
            "[00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:50,770]  Net income, we are actually giving out a target of 8% growth, which in terms of EPS is 3.5%.\n",
            "[00:07:50,770 --> 00:08:00,770]  On the CAPEX, this year, we'll continue to roll out, deploy our 3G network\n",
            "[00:08:00,770 --> 00:08:05,770]  and continue to increase our self-owned backhoe ratio.\n",
            "[00:08:05,770 --> 00:08:13,770]  So this year, I think the CAPEX, with the tremendous growth on the data traffic,\n",
            "[00:08:13,770 --> 00:08:19,770]  we are forecasting 11.8% of the total CAPEX to our total revenue,\n",
            "[00:08:19,770 --> 00:08:26,770]  which is also quite in line with our previous guidance that it will be within 12% of our total revenue.\n",
            "[00:08:26,770 --> 00:08:34,910]  So this year, the absolute amount we're looking at is $10.5 billion.\n",
            "[00:08:34,910 --> 00:08:43,910]  My last page is trying to re-emphasize our dividend policy.\n",
            "[00:08:43,910 --> 00:08:47,910]  We have announced last year that from last year onward,\n",
            "[00:08:47,910 --> 00:08:54,910]  our dividend payout policy will be at least 100% of the current year earnings.\n",
            "[00:08:54,910 --> 00:09:06,740]  So we will continue to maintain this dividend payout policy unchanged for this year.\n",
            "[00:09:06,740 --> 00:09:14,740]  So with this, that very quickly concludes our fourth quarter results conference,\n",
            "[00:09:14,740 --> 00:09:20,740]  and also we attach here our this year's guidance.\n",
            "[00:09:20,740 --> 00:09:26,740]  So I keep Gary's promise at the very beginning that we'll keep this investor conference effective.\n",
            "[00:09:26,740 --> 00:09:33,200]  So right now, we are open for questions.\n",
            "[00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:36,200]  We are now in our question and answer session.\n",

            "[00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:46,200]  After you're announced, please ask your question.\n",
            "[00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:50,200]  If you find that your question has been answered before and it's your turn to speak,\n",

            "[00:09:59,180 --> 00:10:08,030]  The first question is Anna from Barclays, Hong Kong.\n",

            "[00:10:11,220 --> 00:10:12,220]  Yes, hi, good afternoon.\n",
            "[00:10:12,220 --> 00:10:13,220]  Thank you for the call.\n",
            "[00:10:13,220 --> 00:10:18,220]  I just had one question, and that's really on the guidance.\n",
            "[00:10:18,220 --> 00:10:21,220]  It does appear to be, I guess, slightly conservative.\n",
            "[00:10:21,220 --> 00:10:26,220]  I'm just wondering whether there is some amount of conservatism built into, I guess,\n",
            "[00:10:26,220 --> 00:10:30,220]  you know, service revenue growth of 4% or, you know,\n",
            "[00:10:30,220 --> 00:10:34,220]  what the margin assumptions are for maybe the fixed versus the mobile business.\n",
            "[00:10:34,220 --> 00:10:36,220]  If you could give us some more color on, you know,\n",
            "[00:10:36,220 --> 00:10:38,220]  whether there is some conservatism built into this,\n",
            "[00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:43,220]  so whether there is any realistic factors that force you to kind of guide the way you're guiding for 2013.\n",
            "[00:10:43,220 --> 00:10:45,220]  I'd appreciate that very much.\n",
            "[00:10:45,220 --> 00:10:49,940]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:10:49,940 --> 00:10:53,940]  Actually, this is a very realistic guidance for 2013,\n",
            "[00:10:53,940 --> 00:10:56,940]  and you mentioned about the service revenue growth.\n",
            "[00:10:56,940 --> 00:11:04,940]  In this year, 2013 versus 2012, there is a more complicated impact on the regulatory side.\n",
            "[00:11:05,940 --> 00:11:09,940]  So prior years, there had always been X value,\n",
            "[00:11:09,940 --> 00:11:16,940]  and this year we have the mobile termination rate reduction among the operator.\n",
            "[00:11:16,940 --> 00:11:21,940]  And for FET, there is going to be a revenue impact.\n",
            "[00:11:21,940 --> 00:11:26,940]  Unfortunately, a big chunk of this revenue impact is actually offset by the cost.\n",
            "[00:11:26,940 --> 00:11:34,940]  But if we net out the revenue as well as the cost, the EBITDA impact for FET for 2013,\n",
            "[00:11:34,940 --> 00:11:40,940]  we estimate between $350 million to $450 million.\n",
            "[00:11:40,940 --> 00:11:47,940]  So considering that, we don't believe this is a conservative guidance.\n",
            "[00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:48,940]  Understood.\n",
            "[00:11:48,940 --> 00:11:54,940]  If I may follow up, the $350 million to $400 million EBITDA impact is just from the interconnect,\n",
            "[00:11:54,940 --> 00:11:57,940]  and this is the transition through to 2017.\n",
            "[00:11:57,940 --> 00:12:02,940]  This is basically the structure that was announced, I believe, a year and a half ago, right,\n",
            "[00:12:02,940 --> 00:12:06,940]  about the fixed mobile interconnect, which transitions away to 2017?\n",
            "[00:12:06,940 --> 00:12:08,940]  No, this is the new one.\n",
            "[00:12:08,940 --> 00:12:09,940]  Okay.\n",
            "[00:12:09,940 --> 00:12:10,940]  Yes.\n",
            "[00:12:10,940 --> 00:12:13,260]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:12:13,260 --> 00:12:15,440]  Okay.\n",
            "[00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:18,440]  The next question is Mel Adas from HSBC.\n",
            "[00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:21,440]  Please go ahead.\n",
            "[00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:22,440]  Hi, good afternoon.\n",
            "[00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:24,440]  Just a few questions on the network side.\n",
            "[00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:30,440]  I was wondering if you can let us know what your average data usage per smartphone user is.\n",
            "[00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:35,440]  And then in terms of the CapEx outlook, I believe Far East Tone has been adding the third\n",
            "[00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:38,440]  and final carrier to a lot of its base stations.\n",
            "[00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:46,440]  So given that we probably won't see the benefit from tiered pricing until 4G launches around\n",
            "[00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:51,440]  about the middle of next year, how comfortable do you feel with the network capacity,\n",
            "[00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:54,440]  given that most new carriers have been added,\n",
            "[00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:57,440]  there's more and more smartphone customers arriving on the network?\n",
            "[00:12:57,440 --> 00:13:02,580]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:13:02,580 --> 00:13:10,580]  Average data usage for our smartphone is about 1.5 to 1.75 gigs per month.\n",
            "[00:13:10,580 --> 00:13:13,280]  Okay.\n",
            "[00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:19,280]  Regarding the CapEx question, at this stage, we are quite confident that this year,\n",
            "[00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:25,280]  I think more than close to 90% of our cell site will be equipped with the 42MF,\n",
            "[00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:27,280]  which is the third carrier.\n",
            "[00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:34,280]  But right now, I think for those high-capacity areas, we are more using the RRU to expand\n",
            "[00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:35,280]  the overall capacity.\n",
            "[00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:39,280]  So far, we find this is pretty much effective,\n",
            "[00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:47,280]  so we do not see any capacity constraints for the next two years before the 4G is really\n",
            "[00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:49,280]  coming on our 3G network.\n",
            "[00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:55,280]  So that's why we put forward this, I would say, pretty much aggressive CapEx target\n",
            "[00:13:55,280 --> 00:14:01,280]  for this year, which is continue to expand our 3G, not only on the cell site,\n",
            "[00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:03,820]  but also the capacity.\n",
            "[00:14:03,820 --> 00:14:04,820]  Okay, thank you.\n",
            "[00:14:04,820 --> 00:14:08,200]  Yes.\n",
            "[00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:11,200]  The next question is from Chris from Credit Suisse Hong Kong.\n",
            "[00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:12,200]  Please go ahead.\n",
            "[00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:13,200]  Hi.\n",
            "[00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:17,200]  Good afternoon, and thank you for your time and the opportunity to ask a question.\n",
            "[00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:23,200]  The first question is regarding the regulatory impact that you built into your forecast.\n",
            "[00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:28,200]  I understand that you already built in the reduction in mandatory tariff,\n",
            "[00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:34,200]  the reduction in mobile termination rate, and the impact is $350 million to $450 million\n",
            "[00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:36,200]  on the EBITDA level.\n",
            "[00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:42,200]  I'm not sure whether you have built in any impact on the things like X factor, for example,\n",
            "[00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:45,200]  which I understand would come to an end in March,\n",
            "[00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:52,200]  but there's still no clarity on what kind of reduction would continue after that in what form.\n",
            "[00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:55,200]  Just want to hear your thought and what's going into your forecast right now.\n",
            "[00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:59,200]  The second question is just regarding around your guidance as well.\n",
            "[00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:03,200]  What do you see as key upside risks or downside risks to your forecast?\n",
            "[00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:06,200]  I understand that it's quite realistic, but just want to hear your thought.\n",
            "[00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:08,200]  It could be a moving part.\n",
            "[00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:10,200]  The third question is in general.\n",
            "[00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:15,200]  Margin improvement does not seem to really come through much at all.\n",
            "[00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:21,200]  I just want to understand whether it's basically wiped out by the regulatory impact\n",
            "[00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:26,200]  or what is the issue in terms of the timing of the margin improvement\n",
            "[00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:31,200]  that we should expect to see operational leverage, for example.\n",
            "[00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:34,200]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:38,200]  I'll answer your questions one and three.\n",
            "[00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:48,200]  The EBITDA negative impact of $350 million to $450 million for 2013 is a comprehensive estimate\n",
            "[00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:52,200]  that we assess for the entire regulatory impact.\n",
            "[00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:59,200]  The primary component of that is the mobile termination rate cut.\n",
            "[00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:04,200]  Like you said, the X value is going to terminate,\n",
            "[00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:12,200]  so we believe the government may still like to see some rate reduction on the retail side as well.\n",
            "[00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:15,200]  So we did factor in a little bit of that.\n",
            "[00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:22,200]  So the comprehensive assessment from our side is somewhere around $350 million to $450 million.\n",
            "[00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:27,200]  Then in terms of your question number three, margin improvement,\n",
            "[00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:34,200]  again, for us, we look more on the absolute value of EBITDA.\n",
            "[00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:39,200]  If you look at our guidance year over year, our EBITDA is still growing 5%,\n",
            "[00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:43,200]  more than our service revenue growth of 4%.\n",
            "[00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:49,200]  So we do think this is a margin-solid improvement.\n",
            "[00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:53,200]  Margin percentage, like we have said all along,\n",
            "[00:16:53,200 --> 00:17:02,500]  that this is diluted by the fact that we are increasing our equipment revenue.\n",
            "[00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:03,500]  Okay.\n",
            "[00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:09,500]  Regarding this forecast we put forward, regarding the downside risk,\n",
            "[00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:12,500]  to be frank, I really don't see a big downside risk,\n",
            "[00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:18,500]  unless the market really go very, I mean, abnormal competition.\n",
            "[00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:24,500]  If the competition can continue to be kind of penile, like the current situation,\n",
            "[00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:30,500]  I really don't see a big downside risk for this version of the forecast that we put forward.\n",
            "[00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:33,500]  Of course, we are always looking at upside.\n",
            "[00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:38,500]  So if our beta pick-up rate can be a little bit faster,\n",
            "[00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:46,500]  or even on the mid-low tier smartphone that we can actually sell a bigger mix on that,\n",
            "[00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:51,500]  certainly there will be additional upside to this version of the budget.\n",
            "[00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:56,780]  So that will be my answer to this question.\n",
            "[00:17:56,780 --> 00:17:57,780]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:17:57,780 --> 00:18:00,780]  Just one additional follow-up question.\n",
            "[00:18:00,780 --> 00:18:05,780]  Do you see any room that the market can actually reduce the level of subsidies,\n",
            "[00:18:05,780 --> 00:18:10,840]  or you think that's actually a very far-fetched concept and not realistic?\n",
            "[00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:14,840]  That really depends on the handset mix, I would say.\n",
            "[00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:18,840]  Because last year, if you recall, in the fourth quarter,\n",
            "[00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:24,840]  that our overall high-end handset roughly represented 60% of our total portfolio.\n",
            "[00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:29,840]  So I do see that this year the percentage is slightly coming down.\n",
            "[00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:33,840]  So I think if these things continue with the trend,\n",
            "[00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:39,870]  and every operator is looking at migrating their 2G customer onto the 3G\n",
            "[00:18:39,870 --> 00:18:41,870]  with the entry-level smartphones,\n",
            "[00:18:41,870 --> 00:18:46,870]  I do see there is a possibility that the overall subsidy level can come down.\n",
            "[00:18:46,870 --> 00:18:52,030]  But regarding whether the operator can work that together,\n",
            "[00:18:52,030 --> 00:18:55,030]  and really look at the subject situation,\n",
            "[00:18:55,030 --> 00:19:01,030]  I think the chance is not high because this is a competitive market.\n",
            "[00:19:01,030 --> 00:19:05,030]  We have five players in this market, so it will be difficult.\n",
            "[00:19:05,030 --> 00:19:09,030]  But it will be more driven from the mix of the smartphones we sell.\n",
            "[00:19:09,030 --> 00:19:10,030]  Okay, thank you.\n",
            "[00:19:10,030 --> 00:19:11,030]  Just one last thing.\n",
            "[00:19:11,030 --> 00:19:12,030]  Very housekeeping question.\n",
            "[00:19:12,030 --> 00:19:19,030]  In terms of the handset sales mix between the high-end, mid-end, and low-end in the fourth quarter,\n",
            "[00:19:19,030 --> 00:19:24,030]  I understand that it would not be very representative because of the high-end handsets.\n",
            "[00:19:24,030 --> 00:19:26,030]  But I just want to understand the dynamics there.\n",
            "[00:19:26,030 --> 00:19:35,230]  60% high-end, 20% mid-end, and 20% low-end.\n",
            "[00:19:35,230 --> 00:19:38,180]  Thank you very much.\n",
            "[00:19:38,180 --> 00:19:47,340]  The next question is from the audience. Please go ahead.\n",
            "[00:19:47,340 --> 00:19:50,340]  Yes, good afternoon. Thank you for your time.\n",
            "[00:19:50,340 --> 00:19:52,340]  I have a couple of questions.\n",
            "[00:19:52,340 --> 00:19:56,340]  The first thing also relates, I guess, to the margin,\n",
            "[00:19:56,340 --> 00:20:01,340]  but I would like to ask probably from a different angle.\n",
            "[00:20:01,340 --> 00:20:05,340]  In terms of the cost structure, in the next one to two years,\n",
            "[00:20:05,340 --> 00:20:13,340]  what kind of the cost item as percentage revenue do you think you have the upside pressure?\n",
            "[00:20:13,340 --> 00:20:18,340]  For instance, probably maybe network maintenance, the support cost,\n",
            "[00:20:18,340 --> 00:20:21,340]  or handset subsidy cost, or marketing cost.\n",
            "[00:20:21,340 --> 00:20:27,340]  But what cost item do you think that could be cost-saving,\n",
            "[00:20:27,340 --> 00:20:30,340]  which could help the margin to improve?\n",
            "[00:20:30,340 --> 00:20:32,340]  That's my number one question.\n",
            "[00:20:32,340 --> 00:20:37,340]  Number two is regarding your mobile cap as a notice,\n",
            "[00:20:37,340 --> 00:20:45,340]  you have raised it considerably in 2013.\n",
            "[00:20:45,340 --> 00:20:46,340]  I understand.\n",
            "[00:20:46,340 --> 00:20:51,340]  It shouldn't include any cap as a future 4G network rollout.\n",
            "[00:20:51,340 --> 00:20:58,340]  But my question is whether or not you have started to factor in some of the core network\n",
            "[00:20:58,340 --> 00:21:05,340]  bandwidth improvement in this cap as for 2013,\n",
            "[00:21:05,340 --> 00:21:10,340]  probably not on the active network, but more on the core network side.\n",
            "[00:21:10,340 --> 00:21:17,340]  My last question also, regarding your service revenue forecast of 4% next year,\n",
            "[00:21:17,340 --> 00:21:23,340]  sorry, this year in 2013, can you split it roughly?\n",
            "[00:21:23,340 --> 00:21:30,340]  Just give us some guidance regarding how the voice revenue could decline,\n",
            "[00:21:30,340 --> 00:21:38,340]  but do you expect your mobile data revenue to grow at the same pace as 2012?\n",
            "[00:21:38,340 --> 00:21:39,820]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:21:39,820 --> 00:21:42,820]  I'll answer your questions number one and three.\n",
            "[00:21:42,820 --> 00:21:47,820]  For question number one, with regard to our cost structure,\n",
            "[00:21:47,820 --> 00:21:52,820]  I think from our performance during 2012,\n",
            "[00:21:52,820 --> 00:21:55,820]  you can see that our cost structure has actually improved slightly.\n",
            "[00:21:55,820 --> 00:22:02,820]  That's how we could improve our EBITDA more than we did our service revenue.\n",
            "[00:22:02,820 --> 00:22:07,820]  And specifically, if we look at the line items within the cost structure,\n",
            "[00:22:07,820 --> 00:22:10,820]  I would say I'm sure you agree with me,\n",
            "[00:22:10,820 --> 00:22:15,820]  subsidy is the biggest single ticket item of our cost structure,\n",
            "[00:22:15,820 --> 00:22:21,820]  and total subsidy value is going to go up every year.\n",
            "[00:22:21,820 --> 00:22:28,820]  And this is primarily driven by the fact that we are still growing our smartphone penetration,\n",
            "[00:22:28,820 --> 00:22:35,820]  and therefore not only we have to convert new users from voice only to voice plus data,\n",
            "[00:22:35,820 --> 00:22:41,820]  we have to renew the existing smartphone users to another contract of smartphone.\n",
            "[00:22:41,820 --> 00:22:47,820]  However, we are trying our best to manage other elements of our cost structure.\n",
            "[00:22:47,820 --> 00:22:54,820]  For instance, media span is one area that we have taken a very strong position\n",
            "[00:22:54,820 --> 00:22:57,820]  in terms of managing the media span very effectively,\n",
            "[00:22:57,820 --> 00:23:02,820]  and also other related promotion span.\n",
            "[00:23:03,820 --> 00:23:10,820]  And two areas that I want to mention specifically with regard to the network.\n",
            "[00:23:10,820 --> 00:23:13,820]  Even though our base station number is growing,\n",
            "[00:23:13,820 --> 00:23:18,820]  our network division is doing a very good job in actually maintaining\n",
            "[00:23:18,820 --> 00:23:24,820]  or reducing the total amount that we spend on the maintenance and repair.\n",
            "[00:23:24,820 --> 00:23:31,820]  And also, the fact that we are reducing our reliance on Chunhua for backhaul\n",
            "[00:23:31,820 --> 00:23:39,500]  has also allowed us to reduce the RPEC that we pay to Chunhua for their backhaul service.\n",
            "[00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:45,500]  So all in all, the direction for 2013 would be very similar to 2012.\n",
            "[00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:51,300]  We are definitely going to grow our e-bidang more than we grow our service revenue.\n",
            "[00:23:51,300 --> 00:23:57,300]  And your third question with regard to the service revenue.\n",
            "[00:23:57,300 --> 00:24:04,300]  I think the trend is quite clear that the voice is definitely declining sequentially\n",
            "[00:24:04,300 --> 00:24:06,300]  as well as year over year.\n",
            "[00:24:06,300 --> 00:24:12,300]  What I can share with you is that our mobile data revenue for 2013 versus 2012\n",
            "[00:24:12,300 --> 00:24:18,890]  is going to grow north of 30%.\n",
            "[00:24:18,890 --> 00:24:19,890]  Okay.\n",
            "[00:24:19,890 --> 00:24:27,440]  Your question about whether in this version of the CAPAC,\n",
            "[00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:38,940]  we have to prepare certain 4G core systems.\n",
            "[00:24:38,940 --> 00:24:49,170]  We have not in this version of the CAPAC booking any 4G-related amount.\n",
            "[00:24:49,170 --> 00:24:58,170]  The main reason is I think right now the main strategy for us\n",
            "[00:24:58,170 --> 00:25:04,170]  is we will continue to capitalize on the 3G network investment.\n",
            "[00:25:04,170 --> 00:25:12,170]  Also, mainly because the license will only go out by end of this year.\n",
            "[00:25:12,170 --> 00:25:18,460]  And also, based on the spectrum that we are going to get and the entire ecosystem,\n",
            "[00:25:18,460 --> 00:25:26,460]  for the 700 megahertz, 900, 1800, I think the 1800 megahertz ecosystem is most ready.\n",
            "[00:25:26,460 --> 00:25:33,460]  However, the 1800 megahertz is also currently being occupied by all the operators\n",
            "[00:25:33,460 --> 00:25:36,460]  to run our current GSM network.\n",
            "[00:25:36,460 --> 00:25:40,460]  So I think there is still a lot of variables during this period\n",
            "[00:25:40,460 --> 00:25:45,490]  that how will we continue to run this spectrum.\n",
            "[00:25:45,490 --> 00:25:53,480]  So that's why this year, the CAPAC, we have not factored in any 4G-related investment.\n",
            "[00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:54,480]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:59,480]  I have a follow-up question regarding your awards revenue.\n",
            "[00:25:59,480 --> 00:26:04,480]  On the awards side, do you see when you cut your tariff,\n",
            "[00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:11,480]  do you see you still witness positive prices or it's negative?\n",
            "[00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:16,480]  It's positive, but it's less than one, i.e., the tariff cuts.\n",
            "[00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:25,810]  Basically, the MOU increase cannot offset the tariff cuts.\n",
            "[00:26:25,810 --> 00:26:27,810]  Our MOU is actually flat.\n",
            "[00:26:27,810 --> 00:26:33,810]  For the awards revenue, what we are seeing is that the fact that consumers are ‚Äì\n",
            "[00:26:33,810 --> 00:26:38,810]  I think this is not only for FET, this is applicable to all the operators.\n",
            "[00:26:38,810 --> 00:26:42,810]  Consumers are taking advantage of the on-net benefit,\n",
            "[00:26:42,810 --> 00:26:52,840]  and therefore a growing percentage of the MOU is already paid for within the monthly fee,\n",
            "[00:26:52,840 --> 00:26:56,840]  and therefore it doesn't generate incremental awards revenue for us.\n",
            "[00:26:56,840 --> 00:27:01,320]  So essentially, consumers are getting first.\n",
            "[00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:04,120]  I see. Thank you.\n",
            "[00:27:04,120 --> 00:27:08,500]  The next question is Lucy Liu from JPMorgan.\n",
            "[00:27:08,500 --> 00:27:09,500]  Please go ahead.\n",
            "[00:27:09,500 --> 00:27:12,230]  Hi. Thank you very much.\n",
            "[00:27:12,230 --> 00:27:13,230]  I have a few questions.\n",
            "[00:27:13,230 --> 00:27:15,230]  One is still on your CAPACs.\n",
            "[00:27:15,230 --> 00:27:20,230]  So just a wonder, though, what's the trend for 3G CAPACs in, say,\n",
            "[00:27:20,230 --> 00:27:23,230]  in the next one or two years, starting from 2014?\n",
            "[00:27:23,230 --> 00:27:28,230]  Can we say that 2013 will be the peak year for the 3G investment?\n",
            "[00:27:28,230 --> 00:27:32,230]  And then number two is on margin as well.\n",
            "[00:27:32,230 --> 00:27:37,230]  So I remember that you maybe one year ago,\n",
            "[00:27:37,230 --> 00:27:40,230]  you actually gave us some margin guidance in the longer run,\n",
            "[00:27:40,230 --> 00:27:44,230]  so like reaching 34% in the next four years.\n",
            "[00:27:44,230 --> 00:27:51,230]  So can we have a refresh guidance for the longer-term margin trend, if we may?\n",
            "[00:27:51,230 --> 00:27:56,230]  And also lastly, also the smartphone market competition side.\n",
            "[00:27:56,230 --> 00:28:02,230]  So can we say that 2013 will see a large continuation of the 2012 trend,\n",
            "[00:28:02,230 --> 00:28:07,230]  i.e., that market landscape and also smartphone offering\n",
            "[00:28:07,230 --> 00:28:10,230]  and the promotions, all these things, will be the same,\n",
            "[00:28:10,230 --> 00:28:13,230]  or will you see any new changes coming up?\n",
            "[00:28:13,230 --> 00:28:17,310]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:28:17,310 --> 00:28:21,310]  On your first question, trend for 3G CAPACs,\n",
            "[00:28:21,310 --> 00:28:30,260]  definitely 2013 will be the peak for 3G CAPACs.\n",
            "[00:28:30,260 --> 00:28:32,260]  On margin guidance, actually a year ago,\n",
            "[00:28:32,260 --> 00:28:37,260]  when we set out a mid- to longer-term range of margin,\n",
            "[00:28:37,260 --> 00:28:40,260]  a margin guidance of 34%,\n",
            "[00:28:40,260 --> 00:28:43,260]  that was driven by two things that we mentioned specifically.\n",
            "[00:28:43,260 --> 00:28:46,260]  One is the ASP decline on the smartphone,\n",
            "[00:28:46,260 --> 00:28:51,260]  and the second is the mix growing more toward the mid and low.\n",
            "[00:28:51,260 --> 00:28:58,260]  And we called out an ideal mix whereby high-end should only be 30%.\n",
            "[00:28:58,260 --> 00:29:03,260]  And the reality is very different from what we called for a year ago.\n",
            "[00:29:03,260 --> 00:29:07,260]  So right now, we don't want to give any margin percentage guidance.\n",
            "[00:29:07,260 --> 00:29:11,260]  We believe, as we have said last year all along,\n",
            "[00:29:12,260 --> 00:29:16,260]  that EBITDA dollars is what we are looking for\n",
            "[00:29:16,260 --> 00:29:23,590]  and what we are driving for right now.\n",
            "[00:29:23,590 --> 00:29:28,200]  Your third question, would you please repeat it again?\n",
            "[00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:33,200]  Just wondering the smartphone offering and also the competition.\n",
            "[00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:37,200]  Do you see it will be a large continuation to 2012 trend,\n",
            "[00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:39,200]  or there will be any new threaten?\n",
            "[00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:45,200]  Also, from your side, will there be any new promotion gigs coming through?\n",
            "[00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:52,810]  At this stage, we will see that the market will not have significant change\n",
            "[00:29:52,810 --> 00:29:57,810]  versus the last year, except that I believe, as I just mentioned,\n",
            "[00:29:57,810 --> 00:30:03,810]  that the big three, because we are all running quite a, I would say,\n",
            "[00:30:03,810 --> 00:30:05,810]  big 2G network at this point of time.\n",
            "[00:30:05,810 --> 00:30:12,810]  I believe everybody will try hard to upgrade that our 2G customer onto the 3G,\n",
            "[00:30:12,810 --> 00:30:17,810]  which I think, again, will improve our smartphone penetration rate\n",
            "[00:30:17,810 --> 00:30:21,810]  and also continue to improve our overall data revenue growth.\n",
            "[00:30:21,810 --> 00:30:25,810]  So that's the only thing that I can see from the market.\n",
            "[00:30:25,810 --> 00:30:29,810]  But in terms of the bundling or rate plan,\n",
            "[00:30:29,810 --> 00:30:33,810]  I do not see there will be a significant change.\n",
            "[00:30:33,810 --> 00:30:36,810]  Of course, the day-to-day competition will still be there,\n",
            "[00:30:36,810 --> 00:30:41,810]  but all in all, I do not see a significant change of the market landscape this year.\n",
            "[00:30:41,810 --> 00:30:44,670]  Okay, thank you very much.\n",
            "[00:30:44,670 --> 00:30:51,500]  As a reminder, please press 01 or the telephone keypad for questions.\n",
            "[00:30:51,500 --> 00:30:54,850]  The next question is Bill from Central Bank.\n",

            "[00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:06,200]  This is Stephen Liu from Central Bank.\n",
            "[00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:07,200]  Can you hear me?\n",
            "[00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:09,360]  I have three questions.\n",
            "[00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:14,360]  First, regarding the smartphone uphold in the first quarter, what's the level?\n",
            "[00:31:14,360 --> 00:31:19,360]  I know the past few quarters are quite stable, around 1,500.\n",
            "[00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:23,360]  What's the level in the first quarter and going forward?\n",
            "[00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:28,360]  Is it going to be declining or something stable over the coming few quarters\n",
            "[00:31:28,360 --> 00:31:30,360]  in the smartphone uphold?\n",
            "[00:31:30,360 --> 00:31:32,390]  The first question.\n",
            "[00:31:32,390 --> 00:31:33,390]  Okay.\n",
            "[00:31:33,390 --> 00:31:36,580]  So this is the first question.\n",
            "[00:31:36,580 --> 00:31:37,580]  You have other questions?\n",
            "[00:31:37,580 --> 00:31:39,580]  Yes, I have two more.\n",
            "[00:31:39,580 --> 00:31:43,020]  Next question first, yes.\n",
            "[00:31:43,020 --> 00:31:48,020]  Smartphone uphold for fourth quarter was about 1,400,\n",
            "[00:31:48,020 --> 00:31:57,020]  and we assess the trend for smartphone uphold go down slightly quarter after quarter,\n",
            "[00:31:57,020 --> 00:31:59,020]  and this is primary.\n",
            "[00:31:59,020 --> 00:32:01,020]  If you work out mathematically,\n",
            "[00:32:01,020 --> 00:32:06,020]  actually you will find that our voice-only uphold has been declining as well,\n",
            "[00:32:06,020 --> 00:32:13,020]  because higher value voice-only customers have been upgraded onto smartphones.\n",
            "[00:32:13,020 --> 00:32:17,060]  So if we grow our smartphone penetration more and more,\n",
            "[00:32:17,060 --> 00:32:23,060]  we are communicating with those consumers whose voice-only uphold is lower,\n",
            "[00:32:23,060 --> 00:32:27,060]  and therefore when they add on top of their voice rate plan,\n",
            "[00:32:27,060 --> 00:32:31,060]  the combined smartphone uphold will be slightly lower.\n",
            "[00:32:31,060 --> 00:32:32,600]  Okay.\n",
            "[00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:35,600]  The second question regarding the handset safety.\n",
            "[00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:38,600]  I know you explained all the handset safety immediately.\n",
            "[00:32:38,600 --> 00:32:42,600]  Can you give us some idea about the trend of the subsidy\n",
            "[00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:45,600]  as a percentage of revenue in the past three years,\n",
            "[00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:51,100]  and how is the trend going over the coming two years?\n",
            "[00:32:51,100 --> 00:32:57,030]  Handset safety in the absolute value for the past two years\n",
            "[00:32:57,030 --> 00:33:01,030]  has been growing faster than our service revenue growth.\n",
            "[00:33:01,030 --> 00:33:04,030]  However, like I said,\n",
            "[00:33:04,030 --> 00:33:07,030]  we have managed to more than offset that\n",
            "[00:33:07,030 --> 00:33:12,030]  with cost savings from other components in our cost structure.\n",
            "[00:33:12,030 --> 00:33:17,030]  And going forward, we believe the absolute handset subsidy value continues to grow.\n",
            "[00:33:17,030 --> 00:33:22,030]  Again, this is driven by the fact that we are still growing the number of consumers\n",
            "[00:33:22,030 --> 00:33:24,030]  in our portfolio using smartphones,\n",
            "[00:33:24,030 --> 00:33:27,030]  and therefore not only we have to convert new ones,\n",
            "[00:33:27,030 --> 00:33:32,320]  we have to renew the existing ones as well.\n",
            "[00:33:33,320 --> 00:33:37,320]  Third question regarding the fixed line business.\n",
            "[00:33:37,320 --> 00:33:40,320]  Can you give us some idea about the growth outlook\n",
            "[00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:43,610]  and EBITDA margin in the fixed line business?\n",
            "[00:33:43,610 --> 00:33:44,610]  Okay.\n",
            "[00:33:44,610 --> 00:33:47,610]  For fixed line business, for the past 12 months,\n",
            "[00:33:47,610 --> 00:33:52,610]  the EBITDA margin has been around 24% to 25%,\n",
            "[00:33:52,610 --> 00:33:55,610]  and the top line growth was about 10%.\n",
            "[00:33:55,610 --> 00:34:01,610]  For 2013, we continue to believe the trend will maintain\n",
            "[00:34:01,610 --> 00:34:03,610]  the same top line growth,\n",
            "[00:34:03,610 --> 00:34:07,610]  and then we want to keep roughly the same EBITDA margin.\n",
            "[00:34:07,610 --> 00:34:10,610]  Now, of course, in the fixed line business,\n",
            "[00:34:10,610 --> 00:34:15,610]  especially in the ITT business or SI system integration business,\n",
            "[00:34:15,610 --> 00:34:19,610]  a lot of times the billing is driven by the milestone achievement,\n",
            "[00:34:19,610 --> 00:34:22,610]  and therefore there could be some months that we have higher margin\n",
            "[00:34:22,610 --> 00:34:24,610]  and some months we have lower margin.\n",
            "[00:34:24,610 --> 00:34:27,610]  But if you average out along the range,\n",
            "[00:34:27,610 --> 00:34:31,610]  you arrive at somewhere around 24% EBITDA margin.\n",
            "[00:34:31,610 --> 00:34:32,610]  Okay.\n",
            "[00:34:32,610 --> 00:34:33,610]  Okay, thank you.\n",
            "[00:34:33,610 --> 00:34:36,690]  Thank you very much.\n",
            "[00:34:36,690 --> 00:34:40,690]  The next question is from Sidney Jones from Melding.\n",
            "[00:34:40,690 --> 00:34:43,040]  Please go ahead.\n",
            "[00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:46,040]  Thank you for the Q&A.\n",
            "[00:34:46,040 --> 00:34:47,040]  I have two questions.\n",
            "[00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:51,040]  One is that we noticed that all the companies,\n",
            "[00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:57,040]  all the three telcos actually were guiding a lower earning growth\n",
            "[00:34:57,040 --> 00:34:59,040]  than the consensus,\n",
            "[00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:04,040]  and I suspect maybe each of you are factoring in a higher competition.\n",
            "[00:35:04,040 --> 00:35:11,040]  And just on that, what's your smartphone penetration target for this year?\n",
            "[00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:13,040]  That's one question.\n",
            "[00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:18,040]  My second question is the handset subsidy,\n",
            "[00:35:18,040 --> 00:35:22,040]  is there a growth rate for this year?\n",
            "[00:35:22,040 --> 00:35:29,040]  Particularly, what have you assumed for the iPhone contract?\n",
            "[00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:31,040]  What's the percentage of the one-year contract\n",
            "[00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:33,040]  and what's the percentage of the two-year contract?\n",
            "[00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:34,040]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:35:34,040 --> 00:35:36,650]  Okay.\n",
            "[00:35:36,650 --> 00:35:41,370]  Smartphone penetration.\n",
            "[00:35:41,370 --> 00:35:42,370]  Smartphone penetration,\n",
            "[00:35:42,370 --> 00:35:47,370]  you will continue to grow at a rate of about one percentage point a month.\n",
            "[00:35:47,370 --> 00:35:50,370]  2012 we ended at 42%,\n",
            "[00:35:50,370 --> 00:35:56,370]  and for 2013 we still plan around adding one percentage point a month.\n",
            "[00:35:56,370 --> 00:36:02,370]  And you may have noticed that in Q4 we did slightly better than that.\n",
            "[00:36:02,370 --> 00:36:06,370]  On your second question for the handset subsidy,\n",
            "[00:36:06,370 --> 00:36:11,370]  again, I cannot disclose the handset subsidy value,\n",
            "[00:36:11,370 --> 00:36:13,370]  except that it is growing.\n",
            "[00:36:13,370 --> 00:36:19,370]  And if you compare, this is my question back to you, actually.\n",
            "[00:36:19,370 --> 00:36:24,370]  If you look at our iPhone 5 rate plan combination\n",
            "[00:36:24,370 --> 00:36:26,370]  and compare that to iPhone 4S,\n",
            "[00:36:26,370 --> 00:36:31,370]  actually you would see that for certain rate plan combinations,\n",
            "[00:36:31,370 --> 00:36:36,370]  we have actually reduced iPhone 5 subsidy a little bit.\n",
            "[00:36:36,370 --> 00:36:42,400]  And in terms of the iPhone one-year and two-year contracts\n",
            "[00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:49,400]  in our 2013 plan, we are using somewhere 50-50 mix.\n",
            "[00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:51,390]  Okay.\n",
            "[00:36:51,390 --> 00:36:53,390]  Just one follow-up question.\n",
            "[00:36:53,390 --> 00:36:57,390]  We have seen that Taiwan Mobile has started to implement\n",
            "[00:36:57,390 --> 00:37:02,390]  this fair value accounting method required by the IFRS.\n",
            "[00:37:02,390 --> 00:37:04,390]  They are doing it from this year.\n",
            "[00:37:04,390 --> 00:37:07,740]  What's Forrestone's plan on this?\n",
            "[00:37:07,740 --> 00:37:08,740]  Okay.\n",
            "[00:37:08,740 --> 00:37:13,740]  First of all, under the current IFRS accounting system,\n",
            "[00:37:13,740 --> 00:37:16,740]  two methods are both accepted,\n",
            "[00:37:16,740 --> 00:37:21,740]  one being residual method and the other being relative fair value.\n",
            "[00:37:21,740 --> 00:37:29,100]  And FEP is currently using residual like we have had for a long time.\n",
            "[00:37:29,100 --> 00:37:34,100]  And we understand that an amendment is being circulated\n",
            "[00:37:35,100 --> 00:37:40,100]  to visualize the relative fair value only.\n",
            "[00:37:40,100 --> 00:37:45,100]  So we assess the timing to be somewhere around 2015.\n",
            "[00:37:45,100 --> 00:37:50,100]  So our game plan is that we will implement the relative fair value\n",
            "[00:37:50,100 --> 00:37:52,100]  only when we are active,\n",
            "[00:37:52,100 --> 00:37:55,100]  and we will align with our peer companies\n",
            "[00:37:55,100 --> 00:37:58,450]  who are still using residual method.\n",
            "[00:37:58,450 --> 00:38:01,530]  Okay.\n",
            "[00:38:01,530 --> 00:38:04,530]  So basically somewhere before 2015,\n",
            "[00:38:05,530 --> 00:38:07,880]  no specific time?\n",
            "[00:38:07,880 --> 00:38:10,880]  It's not going to be before 2015.\n",
            "[00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:13,880]  Our current estimate is 2015.\n",
            "[00:38:13,880 --> 00:38:14,980]  Okay.\n",
            "[00:38:14,980 --> 00:38:15,980]  Okay.\n",
            "[00:38:15,980 --> 00:38:20,080]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:38:20,080 --> 00:38:22,080]  The next question is Joe Ding from JIC.\n",
            "[00:38:22,080 --> 00:38:24,300]  Please go ahead.\n",
            "[00:38:24,300 --> 00:38:25,300]  Hi.\n",
            "[00:38:25,300 --> 00:38:27,300]  Thanks very much for the call.\n",
            "[00:38:27,300 --> 00:38:29,300]  I have a few questions,\n",
            "[00:38:29,300 --> 00:38:35,300]  just a question on NCIC and their progress in penetrating enterprise accounts,\n",
            "[00:38:35,300 --> 00:38:37,300]  particularly some of the larger ones.\n",
            "[00:38:37,300 --> 00:38:41,300]  If you could give an update on their progress.\n",
            "[00:38:41,300 --> 00:38:43,300]  Second question is,\n",
            "[00:38:43,300 --> 00:38:47,300]  could you give a bit of an update on your plans for your data centers?\n",
            "[00:38:47,300 --> 00:38:50,300]  And third question,\n",
            "[00:38:50,300 --> 00:38:52,300]  any updates on the China Mobile investment\n",
            "[00:38:52,300 --> 00:38:57,300]  or any updates on the progress you are making with China Mobile\n",
            "[00:38:57,300 --> 00:38:59,300]  irrespective of their investment?\n",
            "[00:38:59,300 --> 00:39:02,830]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:39:02,830 --> 00:39:04,830]  Okay.\n",
            "[00:39:04,830 --> 00:39:09,120]  NCIC specifically for our enterprise business unit,\n",
            "[00:39:09,120 --> 00:39:15,120]  and our achievement on the enterprise or fixed line\n",
            "[00:39:15,120 --> 00:39:20,120]  has always been that we are growing our market share in the enterprise segment.\n",
            "[00:39:20,120 --> 00:39:28,120]  During 2012, our market share grew about 2.5 percentage points to 14.5,\n",
            "[00:39:28,120 --> 00:39:33,120]  and our game plan is that we want to continue to chip away market share\n",
            "[00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:35,120]  from competitors,\n",
            "[00:39:35,120 --> 00:39:39,120]  and then every year we grow our market share between 2% to 3%.\n",
            "[00:39:39,120 --> 00:39:43,120]  And so far, we believe we are on the sound footing to achieve that.\n",
            "[00:39:43,120 --> 00:39:48,120]  And when we translate that kind of market share growth onto the P&L,\n",
            "[00:39:48,120 --> 00:39:53,120]  that would mean that we grow our revenue top line about 10% a year.\n",
            "[00:39:53,120 --> 00:39:56,120]  And for the margin fund,\n",
            "[00:39:56,120 --> 00:40:02,120]  definitely we believe a 24% EBITDA margin, 25% EBITDA margin\n",
            "[00:40:02,120 --> 00:40:08,880]  is a sustainable fixed line or enterprise margin that we want to see.\n",
            "[00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:09,880]  Okay.\n",
            "[00:40:09,880 --> 00:40:11,880]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:40:11,880 --> 00:40:15,880]  Your second question regarding the data centers,\n",
            "[00:40:15,880 --> 00:40:20,880]  we are planning to build up a new data center in Banqiao,\n",
            "[00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:26,880]  but all the details have not been finalized yet.\n",
            "[00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:30,880]  The main reason we are looking at potentially building up a new data center\n",
            "[00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:33,880]  is we do see with all this data growth,\n",
            "[00:40:33,880 --> 00:40:38,880]  there is increasing demand on the data center capacity.\n",
            "[00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:43,880]  So by looking at last year our IDC business growth,\n",
            "[00:40:43,880 --> 00:40:47,880]  we did see and foresee that in the next three to five years\n",
            "[00:40:47,880 --> 00:40:51,880]  there was continuing demand on the data center.\n",
            "[00:40:51,880 --> 00:40:55,880]  So we are indeed planning a new data center.\n",
            "[00:40:55,880 --> 00:40:59,880]  Your last question regarding China mobile relationship\n",
            "[00:40:59,880 --> 00:41:04,880]  and I think at this stage there is no indication\n",
            "[00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:08,880]  that the government is going to approve for this transaction,\n",
            "[00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:13,880]  but I believe both companies have this mutual understanding\n",
            "[00:41:13,880 --> 00:41:20,880]  that most likely we will just do a very simple extension of the contract continuously\n",
            "[00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:27,880]  until one day that the government really approves the deal,\n",
            "[00:41:27,880 --> 00:41:35,230]  and then we will seriously discuss and relook all the details of whatever engagement.\n",
            "[00:41:35,230 --> 00:41:36,230]  Okay. Thanks Yvonne.\n",
            "[00:41:36,230 --> 00:41:38,230]  Yvonne, just a follow-up question on the data center.\n",
            "[00:41:38,230 --> 00:41:46,760]  Your planned size for that new data center, how big would that be?\n",
            "[00:41:46,760 --> 00:41:53,980]  In terms of racks, it would be between 1,500 to 2,000 racks.\n",
            "[00:41:53,980 --> 00:41:55,980]  Okay. All right. Thank you.\n",

            "[00:42:25,460 --> 00:42:33,780]  Since there is no question, I wish everyone have a very nice Chinese New Year.\n",
            "[00:42:33,780 --> 00:42:35,940]  Thank you very much. Bye-bye.\n",

            "[00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:15,030]  Let's start with our overall market dynamics.\n",
            "[00:01:15,030 --> 00:01:25,030]  In the third quarter of this year at Baristone, we have reported year-on-year around 7.4% growth\n",
            "[00:01:25,030 --> 00:01:31,030]  on the mobile service revenue, which comparing to our competitor,\n",
            "[00:01:31,030 --> 00:01:37,450]  we are actually growing bigger than the peer companies.\n",
            "[00:01:37,450 --> 00:01:41,450]  I think the supporting factors for the mobile service revenue growth\n",
            "[00:01:41,450 --> 00:01:45,450]  is also very fast-growing, the mobile data revenue.\n",
            "[00:01:45,450 --> 00:01:52,450]  So we are actually reporting a 42.8% year-on-year growth on the mobile data revenue.\n",
            "[00:01:52,450 --> 00:01:56,450]  That resulted in the service revenue share change,\n",
            "[00:01:56,450 --> 00:02:02,450]  which comparing to the end of last year that Baristone's mobile service revenue share\n",
            "[00:02:02,450 --> 00:02:09,450]  has been growing from 26.7% up to 27.8% at the end of the third quarter.\n",
            "[00:02:09,450 --> 00:02:17,450]  Essentially, we are grabbing shares both from Zhonghua Telecom and the two smaller operators in Taiwan.\n",
            "[00:02:17,450 --> 00:02:22,930]  Then I'll move into our operational performances.\n",
            "[00:02:22,930 --> 00:02:28,930]  We are also happy to report that even in this very competitive market,\n",
            "[00:02:28,930 --> 00:02:35,930]  we continue to see quite a nice growth on the subscriber base.\n",
            "[00:02:35,930 --> 00:02:41,930]  On a year-on-year basis, we're growing 4.7% of our total subscribers,\n",
            "[00:02:41,930 --> 00:02:45,930]  which right now post-pay is occupying 78%.\n",
            "[00:02:45,930 --> 00:02:51,500]  Our total subscriber base versus prepay is 22%.\n",
            "[00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:58,500]  Aside from the customer growth, we are also continuing to grow in the total usage.\n",
            "[00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:05,500]  You can see that our post-pay usage is growing 5.8% on a year-on-year basis.\n",
            "[00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:10,500]  Most importantly is behind all this traffic growth,\n",
            "[00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:18,500]  our R-pool of our post-pay customers is also growing by 5.4% on a year-on-year basis.\n",
            "[00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:26,460]  I think this majority is driven by this smartphone penetration.\n",
            "[00:03:28,490 --> 00:03:33,490]  On the financial profitability side, I think all the way from the top line to bottom line,\n",
            "[00:03:33,490 --> 00:03:38,490]  we are reporting quite a nice growth on our consolidated service revenue.\n",
            "[00:03:38,490 --> 00:03:44,490]  For the first three quarters, we are growing 8.8% on a year-on-year basis.\n",
            "[00:03:44,490 --> 00:03:48,490]  The absolute value is close to $4.2 billion.\n",
            "[00:03:48,490 --> 00:03:56,490]  Our consolidated EBITDA is growing around $2 billion, which is 12.4% on a year-on-year basis.\n",
            "[00:03:56,490 --> 00:03:59,490]  Down to the bottom line, which is net income,\n",
            "[00:03:59,490 --> 00:04:05,490]  we are actually reporting 26.7% on a year-on-year basis.\n",
            "[00:04:05,490 --> 00:04:10,580]  So far, I think from our good execution,\n",
            "[00:04:10,580 --> 00:04:14,580]  both on the top line and also on the efficiency improvement,\n",
            "[00:04:14,580 --> 00:04:20,580]  we are happy to report good financial results up to the third quarter.\n",
            "[00:04:22,770 --> 00:04:28,770]  We continue to see that our mobile data is continuing to grow.\n",
            "[00:04:28,770 --> 00:04:34,770]  In the third quarter, still quite a nice growth, about 42.8%.\n",
            "[00:04:34,770 --> 00:04:38,770]  Even on the tradition that after the summer vacation,\n",
            "[00:04:38,770 --> 00:04:43,770]  it should be a slowdown kind of season for Taiwan.\n",
            "[00:04:43,770 --> 00:04:50,860]  But still, I think on the data side, we still see quite a nice growth, even in the third quarter.\n",
            "[00:04:51,860 --> 00:05:01,520]  So the data service subscriber growth essentially is growing 53% on a year-on-year basis.\n",
            "[00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:06,520]  On the consolidated financials, I won't go into details,\n",
            "[00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:12,520]  but just from the top line all the way down to the net income,\n",
            "[00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:20,520]  we are not only achieving our guidance, but we are also outperforming our guidance.\n",
            "[00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:26,520]  So on year-to-day, our total revenue achievement percentage is 105%,\n",
            "[00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:34,370]  and EBITDA is 104%, and net income is 120%.\n",
            "[00:05:34,370 --> 00:05:40,660]  Comparing to our full-year guidance, I think the most important thing is,\n",
            "[00:05:40,660 --> 00:05:44,660]  I think let's look at the EBITDA line,\n",
            "[00:05:44,660 --> 00:05:49,660]  that we have achieved 76% of the full-year guidance,\n",
            "[00:05:49,660 --> 00:05:55,660]  and on the EPS side, we have achieved 81% of the year-to-day guidance.\n",
            "[00:05:55,660 --> 00:06:02,220]  On the balance sheet, still a pretty strong balance sheet.\n",
            "[00:06:02,220 --> 00:06:07,220]  We are actually in a net cash position, about $9.7 billion,\n",
            "[00:06:07,220 --> 00:06:12,220]  and our free cash flow on a year-to-day basis is close to $10 billion,\n",
            "[00:06:12,220 --> 00:06:17,220]  which is on track to our full-year guidance on the free cash flow.\n",
            "[00:06:21,010 --> 00:06:28,010]  On the business side, I just mentioned that the good performance is being mainly driven\n",
            "[00:06:28,010 --> 00:06:32,010]  by the continuous smart devices uptake.\n",
            "[00:06:32,010 --> 00:06:41,040]  In the third quarter, our smart devices accounted 82% of our total new devices sold,\n",
            "[00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:49,040]  and our smartphone penetration has reached 36.5% at the end of the third quarter.\n",
            "[00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:52,040]  I think we continue to see every month,\n",
            "[00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:58,200]  it's about 1% growth on the smartphone penetration rate.\n",
            "[00:06:58,200 --> 00:07:04,200]  Another thing that is also, I think, still quite encouraging is,\n",
            "[00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:08,200]  even with this continuous smart devices penetration,\n",
            "[00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:14,200]  the average smartphone output so far is still ranging at close to 1,500.\n",
            "[00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:22,300]  So it's $1,470 for our R pool.\n",
            "[00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:27,300]  So still, I think comparing to whatever the feature phones,\n",
            "[00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:31,300]  still double A, I mean the R pool on the feature phones.\n",
            "[00:07:31,300 --> 00:07:40,990]  So with this, I think it concludes our third quarter update.\n",
            "[00:07:40,990 --> 00:07:48,280]  We want you to be confident that our growing momentum is continuing\n",
            "[00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:54,310]  and being backed up by a strong growth on the customer number,\n",
            "[00:07:54,310 --> 00:07:58,310]  on the usage, as well as the R pool.\n",
            "[00:07:58,310 --> 00:08:03,310]  We do not see a slowing down on the smartphone penetration rate.\n",
            "[00:08:03,310 --> 00:08:10,310]  Essentially, we continue to see that this trend will continue at least until next year.\n",
            "[00:08:10,310 --> 00:08:14,310]  So that concludes our third quarter update.\n",
            "[00:08:14,310 --> 00:08:18,620]  Let's start Q&A section, please.\n",
            "[00:08:18,620 --> 00:08:22,170]  We will now begin our question and answer session.\n",
            "[00:08:22,170 --> 00:08:24,170]  If you have a question for today's speaker,\n",
            "[00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:29,170]  please press 01 on the telephone keypad and you will enter the queue.\n",
            "[00:08:29,170 --> 00:08:32,170]  After you are announced, please ask your question.\n",
            "[00:08:32,170 --> 00:08:36,170]  If you find that your question has been answered before and it's your turn to speak,\n",
            "[00:08:36,170 --> 00:08:39,170]  please press 02 to cancel the question.\n",
            "[00:08:39,170 --> 00:08:46,810]  The first question is Danny Chu from Nomura.\n",
            "[00:08:46,810 --> 00:08:48,970]  Please go ahead.\n",
            "[00:08:48,970 --> 00:08:50,970]  Thank you for the results conference call.\n",
            "[00:08:50,970 --> 00:08:54,970]  Actually, I just got one very straightforward question.\n",
            "[00:08:54,970 --> 00:09:00,970]  Since iPhone 5 hasn't been launched in third quarter yet this year,\n",
            "[00:09:00,970 --> 00:09:04,970]  and I believe the market probably would expect Firestone\n",
            "[00:09:04,970 --> 00:09:08,970]  to improve its EBITDA margin for third quarter.\n",
            "[00:09:08,970 --> 00:09:11,970]  But if we look at the results on a quarterly basis,\n",
            "[00:09:11,970 --> 00:09:16,970]  actually EBITDA margin contracts a little bit in the third quarter of this year.\n",
            "[00:09:16,970 --> 00:09:20,970]  Can you help us to understand why is that so?\n",
            "[00:09:20,970 --> 00:09:21,970]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:09:21,970 --> 00:09:26,180]  Danny, this is TY.\n",
            "[00:09:26,180 --> 00:09:33,260]  I think this relatively flat EBITDA margin is driven by two things.\n",
            "[00:09:33,260 --> 00:09:40,260]  Number one is in Q3, actually, we saw more higher-tier smartphones than Q2.\n",
            "[00:09:40,260 --> 00:09:46,260]  In Q2, we communicated that the higher-tier smartphone accounted for about 45%,\n",
            "[00:09:46,260 --> 00:09:50,260]  and this ratio actually went up to about 50% in Q3.\n",
            "[00:09:50,260 --> 00:09:55,300]  Usually, the higher-tier smartphone comes with a higher subsidy.\n",
            "[00:09:55,300 --> 00:09:57,300]  That's reason number one.\n",
            "[00:09:57,300 --> 00:10:01,300]  Reason number two is in July and August, in particular,\n",
            "[00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:07,300]  we did a tablet promotion in conjunction with a computer exhibit in Taiwan.\n",
            "[00:10:08,300 --> 00:10:10,300]  So we generated a lot of tablets,\n",
            "[00:10:10,300 --> 00:10:15,300]  and the contract for those tablets was three years,\n",
            "[00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:21,520]  and definitely there was some subsidy that came along with the tablet promotion as well.\n",
            "[00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:26,520]  But the incremental revenue definitely will come in\n",
            "[00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:34,790]  throughout the balance of the three-year contract for the tablet promotion.\n",
            "[00:10:34,790 --> 00:10:35,790]  Okay, thank you.\n",
            "[00:10:35,790 --> 00:10:41,380]  The next question is Jet One from Credit Suisse.\n",
            "[00:10:41,380 --> 00:10:42,380]  Please go ahead.\n",
            "[00:10:42,380 --> 00:10:47,310]  Hi, good afternoon, and thank you for the opportunity to ask the questions.\n",
            "[00:10:47,310 --> 00:10:49,310]  I actually have four questions.\n",
            "[00:10:49,310 --> 00:10:54,310]  The first question is regarding the average data usage for smartphones.\n",
            "[00:10:54,310 --> 00:10:58,310]  It seems like you exclude that from the presentation this quarter.\n",
            "[00:10:58,310 --> 00:11:01,310]  I just want to know anything changed, no average usage.\n",
            "[00:11:01,310 --> 00:11:07,310]  The second question is probably in conjunction with the questions asked before.\n",
            "[00:11:07,310 --> 00:11:14,310]  The smartphone growth actually seems to be going ahead of your guidance of around 1% a month currently.\n",
            "[00:11:14,310 --> 00:11:16,310]  Therefore, my question is simple,\n",
            "[00:11:16,310 --> 00:11:19,310]  whether that actually weighs on your third quarter margins\n",
            "[00:11:19,310 --> 00:11:22,310]  and there is room to improve margins further or not into the fourth quarter,\n",
            "[00:11:22,310 --> 00:11:25,310]  assuming that iPhone 5 is not launched yet.\n",
            "[00:11:25,310 --> 00:11:29,310]  The third question is regarding CapEx.\n",
            "[00:11:29,310 --> 00:11:34,310]  Your industry peers seem to be commenting about CapEx pressure,\n",
            "[00:11:34,310 --> 00:11:39,310]  that we should see CapEx on the mobile side increasing into next year.\n",
            "[00:11:39,310 --> 00:11:41,310]  How about on your side?\n",
            "[00:11:41,310 --> 00:11:45,310]  What's your view on CapEx that we should see into next year?\n",
            "[00:11:45,310 --> 00:11:48,310]  The fourth question is regarding the update on the 2G, 4G license auction.\n",
            "[00:11:48,310 --> 00:11:50,310]  Any progress on that front?\n",
            "[00:11:50,310 --> 00:11:56,310]  Any kind of cash you plan to spend on that and about the financing of that,\n",
            "[00:11:56,310 --> 00:11:58,310]  whether that would weigh on your dividend or not?\n",
            "[00:11:58,310 --> 00:12:01,750]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:12:01,750 --> 00:12:02,750]  Okay.\n",
            "[00:12:02,750 --> 00:12:05,750]  For the first question, for the data usage for smartphone,\n",
            "[00:12:05,750 --> 00:12:08,750]  in Q3 it averaged around 1.5 gig.\n",
            "[00:12:08,750 --> 00:12:18,300]  That actually is very similar to what we communicated at the Q2 result conference call.\n",
            "[00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:22,300]  And second question around EBITDA margin.\n",
            "[00:12:22,300 --> 00:12:24,300]  With or without iPhone 5,\n",
            "[00:12:24,300 --> 00:12:28,300]  actually our EBITDA margin is driven by several things,\n",
            "[00:12:28,300 --> 00:12:32,300]  such as our smartphone high-tier, mid-tier, low-tier mix.\n",
            "[00:12:32,300 --> 00:12:39,300]  And along the timeline, we may from time to time launch a promotion on tablet.\n",
            "[00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:41,300]  So at this point in time,\n",
            "[00:12:41,300 --> 00:12:46,300]  I cannot give you a guidance in terms of where our Q4 margin would fall.\n",
            "[00:12:46,300 --> 00:12:49,300]  And number three, in terms of CapEx,\n",
            "[00:12:49,300 --> 00:12:55,300]  we are still contemplating how the 2013 CapEx will shape out.\n",
            "[00:12:55,300 --> 00:12:57,300]  But at this point in time,\n",
            "[00:12:57,300 --> 00:13:03,300]  we still don't see major deviation from the 10 to 12 percentage of total revenue\n",
            "[00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:06,330]  that we have guided so far.\n",
            "[00:13:06,330 --> 00:13:10,330]  For the 2G, 4G license, I'll pass that to Yvonne.\n",
            "[00:13:10,330 --> 00:13:11,330]  Yeah.\n",
            "[00:13:11,330 --> 00:13:15,330]  On the 2G license, I think all three operators\n",
            "[00:13:15,330 --> 00:13:24,490]  have went through the renewal committee's review led by the NCC commissioners.\n",
            "[00:13:24,490 --> 00:13:30,490]  And we are expecting probably a week after or two weeks after,\n",
            "[00:13:30,490 --> 00:13:33,490]  there will be an outcome from the NCC.\n",
            "[00:13:33,490 --> 00:13:37,490]  So it will not be convenient for me to comment at this stage\n",
            "[00:13:37,490 --> 00:13:41,490]  before the official outcome from NCC.\n",
            "[00:13:41,490 --> 00:13:44,490]  Regarding the 4G license,\n",
            "[00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:51,490]  the auction rule so far is not being cleared by NCC.\n",
            "[00:13:51,490 --> 00:13:56,490]  I know there is a lot of discussion on how to auction off\n",
            "[00:13:56,490 --> 00:14:00,490]  all this 217 megahertz spectrum.\n",
            "[00:14:00,490 --> 00:14:03,490]  But one thing I think we can assure the investors is\n",
            "[00:14:03,490 --> 00:14:07,490]  no matter what will be the final auction rules\n",
            "[00:14:07,490 --> 00:14:13,520]  or the final price that we pay out to get the spectrum,\n",
            "[00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:17,520]  there will be no impact on our dividend policies.\n",
            "[00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:25,520]  We still commit to the investment world, which is 100% payout on our earnings.\n",
            "[00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:28,090]  That's clear.\n",
            "[00:14:28,090 --> 00:14:29,090]  Thank you very much.\n",
            "[00:14:29,090 --> 00:14:39,690]  As a reminder, please press 01 on your telephone keypad for questions.\n",
            "[00:14:39,690 --> 00:14:54,020]  The next question is Ted Lynch from Perth Standard Capital Management.\n",
            "[00:14:54,020 --> 00:14:57,270]  Please go ahead.\n",
            "[00:14:57,270 --> 00:14:59,260]  Hello.\n",
            "[00:14:59,260 --> 00:15:00,260]  Hi.\n",
            "[00:15:00,260 --> 00:15:01,260]  Hi.\n",
            "[00:15:01,260 --> 00:15:02,260]  Sorry.\n",
            "[00:15:02,260 --> 00:15:03,260]  Thank you for the opportunity to ask the questions.\n",
            "[00:15:03,260 --> 00:15:05,260]  As far as smartphone penetration,\n",
            "[00:15:05,260 --> 00:15:09,260]  the increase in penetration has been very impressive,\n",
            "[00:15:09,260 --> 00:15:11,260]  as the previous caller mentioned,\n",
            "[00:15:11,260 --> 00:15:14,260]  even above the 1 percentage point per month level.\n",
            "[00:15:14,260 --> 00:15:16,260]  And I was curious, looking forward,\n",
            "[00:15:16,260 --> 00:15:21,260]  if you had any figure in mind for maybe when we would start to see the rate\n",
            "[00:15:21,260 --> 00:15:26,260]  of increase of penetration actually start to decline quarter over quarter,\n",
            "[00:15:26,260 --> 00:15:31,260]  if you have some idea of what you would consider saturation in this market\n",
            "[00:15:31,260 --> 00:15:34,260]  to look like in terms of a penetration number.\n",
            "[00:15:34,260 --> 00:15:35,260]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:15:35,260 --> 00:15:43,190]  For FET, we believe a reasonable milestone would be 50% penetration.\n",
            "[00:15:43,190 --> 00:15:46,190]  And beyond 50% penetration,\n",
            "[00:15:46,190 --> 00:15:51,190]  we believe the penetration would continue to grow at a slower rate.\n",
            "[00:15:51,190 --> 00:15:54,190]  And even though this year up until now,\n",
            "[00:15:54,190 --> 00:15:58,190]  we averaged slightly better than 1 percentage point a month,\n",
            "[00:15:59,190 --> 00:16:04,220]  but our planning is still around adding 1 percentage point a month\n",
            "[00:16:04,220 --> 00:16:08,220]  for the next 12 months, so to speak.\n",
            "[00:16:08,220 --> 00:16:09,770]  Okay.\n",
            "[00:16:09,770 --> 00:16:10,770]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:16:10,770 --> 00:16:13,770]  And one other quick follow-up, just about the all-you-can-eat data plan.\n",
            "[00:16:13,770 --> 00:16:17,770]  I wonder if you have any ideas long-term over if\n",
            "[00:16:17,770 --> 00:16:20,770]  and when we might see a change to that policy on the part of the NCC.\n",
            "[00:16:20,770 --> 00:16:22,860]  Thank you very much.\n",
            "[00:16:22,860 --> 00:16:23,860]  Okay.\n",
            "[00:16:23,860 --> 00:16:30,920]  So I think that the most recent news from some of the government officials,\n",
            "[00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:36,950]  of course, is trying to support this,\n",
            "[00:16:36,950 --> 00:16:43,950]  lift out this unlimited data rate plan and proposing for tier pricing.\n",
            "[00:16:43,950 --> 00:16:46,950]  So I think this is quite a good direction,\n",
            "[00:16:46,950 --> 00:16:52,050]  and we certainly have quite a, I would say,\n",
            "[00:16:52,050 --> 00:16:57,050]  is to view that when LTE is launched in the country,\n",
            "[00:16:57,050 --> 00:17:00,050]  that unlimited data rate plan can be lifted\n",
            "[00:17:00,050 --> 00:17:06,050]  so that the operator will have room to actually do a tier pricing.\n",
            "[00:17:06,050 --> 00:17:13,080]  So I think that's the current status of the tier pricing status.\n",
            "[00:17:13,080 --> 00:17:16,080]  On the 3G side, I think there will be little chance\n",
            "[00:17:16,080 --> 00:17:24,080]  because the current regulation just would be difficult to let us go for that direction.\n",
            "[00:17:24,080 --> 00:17:26,710]  Okay.\n",
            "[00:17:26,710 --> 00:17:31,010]  Thank you very much.\n",
            "[00:17:31,010 --> 00:17:35,010]  Please press 01 on your telephone keypad for questions.\n",
            "[00:17:35,010 --> 00:17:44,180]  The next question is Neil Edison from HSBC.\n",
            "[00:17:44,180 --> 00:17:46,860]  Please go ahead.\n",
            "[00:17:46,860 --> 00:17:47,860]  Hi.\n",
            "[00:17:47,860 --> 00:17:48,860]  Good afternoon.\n",
            "[00:17:48,860 --> 00:17:52,860]  Just really a follow-up on the last question, but this time on smartphone ARPU.\n",
            "[00:17:52,860 --> 00:17:57,860]  It's been pretty steady, I think, for the last four quarters, around 1,500 per month.\n",
            "[00:17:57,860 --> 00:18:00,890]  That's slightly different to what we've seen in other markets\n",
            "[00:18:00,890 --> 00:18:04,890]  where smartphone ARPU starts off high but then naturally trends down\n",
            "[00:18:04,890 --> 00:18:10,890]  as more mid-range users migrate to a smartphone.\n",
            "[00:18:10,890 --> 00:18:12,890]  How do you see this developing?\n",
            "[00:18:12,890 --> 00:18:16,890]  Are your latest smartphone editions still spending as much,\n",
            "[00:18:16,890 --> 00:18:22,560]  or do you expect that to come down through 2013 significantly, I should say?\n",
            "[00:18:25,830 --> 00:18:31,830]  Based on our track record, we believe we'll be able to sustain the smartphone ARPU\n",
            "[00:18:31,830 --> 00:18:43,100]  around 1,500 level up until our penetration reach 50% penetration.\n",
            "[00:18:43,100 --> 00:18:49,100]  Because if you look at the past six-quarter history,\n",
            "[00:18:49,100 --> 00:18:52,100]  only in this quarter we saw a slight decline,\n",
            "[00:18:52,100 --> 00:18:58,100]  but that could be triggered by the summertime behavior that Yvonne just commented.\n",
            "[00:18:58,100 --> 00:19:01,100]  But over a six-period or even longer period of time,\n",
            "[00:19:01,100 --> 00:19:07,100]  we did not see any declining trend on our smartphone ARPU.\n",
            "[00:19:07,100 --> 00:19:13,100]  We are very pleased with that, and we believe that it will continue for the next year or so.\n",
            "[00:19:13,100 --> 00:19:19,900]  Great. Thank you.\n",
            "[00:19:19,900 --> 00:19:21,900]  The next question is Chad Wang from Credit Suisse.\n",
            "[00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:24,060]  Please go ahead.\n",
            "[00:19:24,060 --> 00:19:27,060]  Hi. Just two follow-up questions for me.\n",
            "[00:19:27,060 --> 00:19:30,060]  The first is regarding the smartphone sales mix.\n",
            "[00:19:30,060 --> 00:19:34,060]  I understand that you mentioned earlier that 50% is coming from high-end.\n",
            "[00:19:34,060 --> 00:19:38,060]  Can you help break down the mid-end and low-end for me as well?\n",
            "[00:19:38,060 --> 00:19:45,060]  The second one is on your tablet promotions during the summer vacation promos.\n",
            "[00:19:45,060 --> 00:19:49,060]  Did I hear it right that it's a 24-month contract, or is it shorter or longer than that?\n",
            "[00:19:49,060 --> 00:19:51,420]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:19:51,420 --> 00:19:59,420]  Our Q3 smartphone mix was 50% high-end, 25% mid, and then 25% for low-end.\n",
            "[00:19:59,420 --> 00:20:02,110]  Okay?\n",
            "[00:20:02,110 --> 00:20:06,110]  And your second question, the tablet promotion that we did in July and August,\n",
            "[00:20:06,110 --> 00:20:10,590]  it was actually three years, 36 months.\n",
            "[00:20:10,590 --> 00:20:12,590]  That's a very long time. Thank you.\n",
            "[00:20:12,590 --> 00:20:25,210]  Please press 01 on your telephone keypad for questions.\n",
            "[00:20:25,210 --> 00:20:28,210]  The next question is Ted Lynch from Perth Standard Capital Management.\n",
            "[00:20:28,210 --> 00:20:31,390]  Please go ahead.\n",
            "[00:20:31,390 --> 00:20:33,390]  Hi. Sorry for the quick follow-up.\n",
            "[00:20:33,390 --> 00:20:37,390]  But just to circle back to the data usage per smartphone,\n",
            "[00:20:37,390 --> 00:20:42,390]  you just broke down the sort of high-end versus mid-end versus low-end smartphone numbers.\n",
            "[00:20:42,390 --> 00:20:47,390]  I was wondering if you saw any meaningful difference between the data usage of those different categories of smartphone.\n",
            "[00:20:47,390 --> 00:20:53,390]  In other words, was the data usage for the higher-end phones much bigger than the low-end mid, or was it similar?\n",
            "[00:20:53,390 --> 00:20:55,390]  Any kind of color you could give there would be very helpful.\n",
            "[00:20:55,390 --> 00:20:57,390]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:20:57,390 --> 00:21:00,390]  Right now, actually, we have a very narrow definition for smartphone.\n",
            "[00:21:00,390 --> 00:21:06,390]  When we said in our customer base we have 36% penetration on the smartphone,\n",
            "[00:21:06,390 --> 00:21:10,390]  we only count iPhone and Android.\n",
            "[00:21:10,390 --> 00:21:11,390]  Okay?\n",
            "[00:21:11,390 --> 00:21:16,390]  And between the two, actually, there is a minor difference.\n",
            "[00:21:16,390 --> 00:21:22,390]  We do see iPhone users tend to use higher data usage compared to Android users.\n",
            "[00:21:22,390 --> 00:21:30,390]  But then again, iPhone is 100% high-end, and Android is stretched from high, mid to low.\n",
            "[00:21:30,390 --> 00:21:37,390]  But by and large, iPhone users do use more, approaching 2 giga per month.\n",
            "[00:21:37,390 --> 00:21:44,580]  Would that be similar to a high-end Android user?\n",
            "[00:21:44,580 --> 00:21:50,580]  I guess what I'm trying to get at is it looks like going forward that there's a trend in the industry\n",
            "[00:21:50,580 --> 00:21:53,580]  towards the mid-end smartphone, even the mid to low,\n",
            "[00:21:53,580 --> 00:21:56,580]  depending on how you want to define it in terms of dollar value.\n",
            "[00:21:56,580 --> 00:22:01,580]  And if that percentage goes up, or if it goes up, what the impact might be on EBITDA.\n",
            "[00:22:01,580 --> 00:22:02,580]  It should be positive.\n",
            "[00:22:02,580 --> 00:22:08,580]  So I was just curious if you could give us any color at all about the mid-end smartphone,\n",
            "[00:22:08,580 --> 00:22:10,580]  what kind of data usage you're seeing there.\n",
            "[00:22:10,580 --> 00:22:16,580]  I mean, obviously, your answer, you implied that it's lower than the 2 gig range, more in the 1.5,\n",
            "[00:22:16,580 --> 00:22:18,580]  but I don't know if there's any extra color you can give there.\n",
            "[00:22:18,580 --> 00:22:19,580]  It would be appreciated.\n",
            "[00:22:19,580 --> 00:22:20,580]  Thank you very much.\n",
            "[00:22:20,580 --> 00:22:22,960]  Okay.\n",
            "[00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:28,960]  I don't have a specific number for average data usage of mid-end and low-end,\n",
            "[00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:36,960]  but definitely it is high-end smartphone we tend to use more,\n",
            "[00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:43,960]  and then by definition the low-end smartphone user will use the lowest amount of data usage.\n",
            "[00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:46,960]  And it so happens that there's EBITDA.\n",
            "[00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:53,140]  Their output contribution is also falling along the same line.\n",
            "[00:22:53,140 --> 00:22:54,140]  Okay. Thank you.\n",
            "[00:22:54,140 --> 00:22:59,930]  The next question is Kim Tang from Luxin.\n",
            "[00:22:59,930 --> 00:23:00,930]  Please go ahead.\n",
            "[00:23:00,930 --> 00:23:04,280]  Hi. Just a very simple question.\n",
            "[00:23:04,280 --> 00:23:12,700]  You mentioned earlier that we expect our smartphone penetration to reach 50 percent,\n",
            "[00:23:12,700 --> 00:23:14,700]  and then our growth rate would start to slow.\n",
            "[00:23:14,700 --> 00:23:22,700]  I'm just trying to understand what assumptions go into the establishment of 50 percent.\n",
            "[00:23:22,700 --> 00:23:25,300]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:23:25,300 --> 00:23:30,300]  Okay. And this 50 percent really comes from a regional benchmark.\n",
            "[00:23:30,300 --> 00:23:34,300]  We look at countries or markets such as Hong Kong and Singapore,\n",
            "[00:23:34,300 --> 00:23:41,300]  and we saw their smartphone penetration, they are already over 50 percent and still growing.\n",
            "[00:23:41,300 --> 00:23:47,300]  But the fact is that Singapore and Hong Kong are really purely a metropolitan market,\n",
            "[00:23:47,300 --> 00:23:52,300]  whereby Taiwan is a combination of metropolitan, suburban,\n",
            "[00:23:52,300 --> 00:23:55,300]  and therefore we believe for a market like Taiwan,\n",
            "[00:23:55,300 --> 00:24:00,300]  50 percent would be a reasonable milestone for us to reach near term.\n",
            "[00:24:00,300 --> 00:24:14,070]  So I assume it's based on a breakdown of what we see as urban population in Taiwan\n",
            "[00:24:14,070 --> 00:24:18,070]  and then what we see as suburban population in Taiwan.\n",
            "[00:24:18,070 --> 00:24:19,300]  That's correct.\n",
            "[00:24:19,300 --> 00:24:26,100]  So what assumption do we have for suburban population smartphone penetration?\n",
            "[00:24:26,100 --> 00:24:30,700]  It would be much lower than 50 percent.\n",
            "[00:24:30,700 --> 00:24:35,800]  Twenty? Twenty-five?\n",
            "[00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:40,800]  So it's much lower than 50 percent?\n",
            "[00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:41,800]  Yes.\n",
            "[00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:45,180]  Okay. All right. Thank you.\n",
            "[00:24:45,180 --> 00:24:50,400]  The next question is Mark from Zuhook Security. Please go ahead.\n",
            "[00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:52,400]  Hi. I just have one question.\n",
            "[00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:57,400]  Could you elaborate more why the post-pay MOU continues to increase\n",
            "[00:24:57,400 --> 00:25:01,400]  while your smartphone penetration also increases at the same time?\n",
            "[00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:08,400]  I would have thought there could be some kind of cannibalization between the data and the voice usage.\n",
            "[00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:15,860]  MOU? Sorry, can you repeat your question again?\n",
            "[00:25:15,860 --> 00:25:25,860]  Yes. On one of the slides, you showed that the post-pay minutes of use continue to increase.\n",
            "[00:25:25,860 --> 00:25:34,860]  And so I'm just thinking in other markets when more and more people are using data services,\n",
            "[00:25:34,860 --> 00:25:43,860]  usually there would be some kind of cannibalization and the voice usage would start to drop.\n",
            "[00:25:43,860 --> 00:25:51,470]  I want to understand why in the Taiwan market the minutes of usage continue to increase.\n",
            "[00:25:51,470 --> 00:25:58,470]  Okay. I think we monitor the international trend very closely as well.\n",
            "[00:25:58,470 --> 00:26:03,470]  And we are certainly mindful of the potential cannibalization.\n",
            "[00:26:03,470 --> 00:26:13,210]  However, in Taiwan, we do sell voice rate plan and data rate plan separately.\n",
            "[00:26:13,210 --> 00:26:20,210]  And therefore, we believe that is a factor that is slightly different in terms of consumer behavior\n",
            "[00:26:20,210 --> 00:26:23,210]  vis-a-vis consumer behavior of other markets.\n",
            "[00:26:23,210 --> 00:26:30,210]  And then again, our marketing continues to have different kinds of campaigns to generate,\n",
            "[00:26:30,210 --> 00:26:36,210]  to encourage consumers to use more, not only for data but also for voice as well.\n",
            "[00:26:36,210 --> 00:26:42,210]  And we believe those campaigns do help in keeping the minute of use high as well.\n",
            "[00:26:42,210 --> 00:26:44,370]  Okay. Thank you.\n",
            "[00:26:44,370 --> 00:26:49,370]  But like you said, the international trend is there is certain cannibalization,\n",
            "[00:26:49,370 --> 00:26:53,370]  so we are mindful of that potential impact.\n",
            "[00:26:53,370 --> 00:26:56,680]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:26:56,680 --> 00:27:06,730]  Please press 01 on the telephone keypad for questions.\n",

            "[00:27:52,940 --> 00:27:56,940]  I will pass the call back to Eric. You may begin.\n",
            "[00:27:56,940 --> 00:28:01,940]  Hi. Thank you, everybody, again for a very efficient conference call.\n",
            "[00:28:01,940 --> 00:28:03,940]  I'll talk to you next time.\n",

            "[00:01:03,820 --> 00:01:08,820]  Like before, we start with the total mobile market in Taiwan.\n",
            "[00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:12,820]  We are pleased to report to you that in the second quarter,\n",
            "[00:01:12,820 --> 00:01:19,820]  that Firestone continues to be the leader that actually grew the most in the Taiwan mobile market.\n",
            "[00:01:19,820 --> 00:01:24,820]  Our mobile service revenue is growing 9.4% on a year-on-year basis.\n",

            "[00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:41,200]  Our overall market share has increased from 26.6% to 27.6% on a year-on-year basis.\n",
            "[00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:45,200]  So all in all, I think in the entire Taiwan mobile market,\n",
            "[00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:50,200]  that we continue to see that the smaller two, meaning the APBW plus EVO,\n",
            "[00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:54,200]  they start to lose their share.\n",
            "[00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:59,200]  And with Firestone picking up the most in terms of market share increase,\n",
            "[00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:07,200]  Zhonghua apparently so far is the one that has lost the most on the market share.\n",
            "[00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:13,870]  Then we move into the second quarter performance of Firestone alone.\n",
            "[00:02:13,870 --> 00:02:19,290]  I'll start with the total subscribers.\n",
            "[00:02:19,290 --> 00:02:24,290]  I think it has been consecutive for 26 months that Firestone has reported\n",
            "[00:02:24,290 --> 00:02:28,290]  a growing trend on our subscribers.\n",
            "[00:02:28,290 --> 00:02:34,290]  At the end of the second quarter, our subscriber has reached 6.77 million\n",
            "[00:02:34,290 --> 00:02:43,390]  and reported a year-on-year 4% growth on the total subscriber numbers.\n",
            "[00:02:43,390 --> 00:02:50,390]  In terms of the traffic and also the ARPU of our customer base,\n",
            "[00:02:50,390 --> 00:02:55,390]  that you can see that Firestone will continue to grow in our total traffic minutes.\n",
            "[00:02:55,390 --> 00:03:01,390]  In second quarter, we continue to grow 8.2% on a year-on-year basis,\n",
            "[00:03:01,390 --> 00:03:07,390]  which means our customer continues to contribute partly because of our growing subscriber,\n",
            "[00:03:07,390 --> 00:03:12,390]  also because of increasing usage on our subscriber base.\n",
            "[00:03:12,390 --> 00:03:21,390]  Another good news is our post-pay ARPU continues to grow more than 7% on a year-on-year basis\n",
            "[00:03:21,390 --> 00:03:26,420]  despite all this negative regulatory impact starting from the second quarter.\n",
            "[00:03:26,420 --> 00:03:36,930]  On the top line, our consolidated revenue is growing nicely at 16% on a year-on-year basis\n",
            "[00:03:36,930 --> 00:03:42,930]  and our service revenue is also growing very nicely at 9% on a year-on-year basis.\n",
            "[00:03:42,930 --> 00:03:48,930]  Our total mobile service revenue, a more exact number,\n",
            "[00:03:48,930 --> 00:03:51,930]  is actually growing 9.4% on a year-on-year basis.\n",
            "[00:03:51,930 --> 00:04:01,940]  Aside from the subscriber growth, the top line growth, our profitability also is showing quite a nice trend.\n",
            "[00:04:01,940 --> 00:04:08,940]  In the second quarter, our consolidated EBITDA has reached $6.4 billion,\n",
            "[00:04:08,940 --> 00:04:13,940]  close to 19% on a year-on-year basis growth.\n",

            "[00:04:21,100 --> 00:04:28,100]  We are pleased to report a close to 32% growth on the net income on a year-on-year basis.\n",
            "[00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:38,740]  All the good financial performance, I think one important driver is this accelerated mobile data growth.\n",
            "[00:04:38,740 --> 00:04:44,740]  Of course, I think on the cost side, I think we have some smart moves\n",
            "[00:04:44,740 --> 00:04:49,740]  so that we can achieve this very good consolidated profitability growth.\n",
            "[00:04:49,740 --> 00:05:00,740]  Specifically into the mobile data, we have reported 47.2% on a year-on-year basis in terms of the data revenue.\n",

            "[00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:36,240]  For the second quarter, comparing to the same period of last year,\n",
            "[00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:41,240]  as I just reported to all of you, our total revenue is growing 16%,\n",
            "[00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:47,240]  with service revenue 9%, EBITDA 19%, and our bottom line is 32%.\n",
            "[00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:52,240]  In terms of achievement of our financial forecast to the external world,\n",
            "[00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:59,240]  our revenue is achieving more than 7%, and our EBITDA is also outperformed by 7%,\n",

            "[00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:11,220]  In terms of the annual achievement that you can see all the way from the top line to the bottom line,\n",
            "[00:06:11,220 --> 00:06:16,220]  we already exceeded more than 50%.\n",
            "[00:06:16,220 --> 00:06:26,500]  This is certainly much better than our original guidance to the investor community earlier this year.\n",
            "[00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:35,670]  On the balance sheet side, you can see that we continue to have quite a strong balance sheet.\n",
            "[00:06:36,670 --> 00:06:40,670]  Our total cash on hand so far is $13.1 billion,\n",
            "[00:06:40,670 --> 00:06:45,670]  but of course in August we're going to pay off the cash dividends.\n",
            "[00:06:45,670 --> 00:06:48,670]  Free cash flow continues to be very strong.\n",
            "[00:06:48,670 --> 00:06:56,670]  In the first half of the year, we have generated $5.8 billion free cash flow.\n",
            "[00:06:56,670 --> 00:07:03,880]  So I would say continuously this is quite a strong balance sheet at this point of time.\n",
            "[00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:11,880]  Coming into some business updates, we have reported to you that all the financial performance\n",
            "[00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:14,880]  is driven by the strong data growth.\n",
            "[00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:22,880]  Our smart devices right now account for 79% of our total new device sold in the second quarter,\n",

            "[00:07:31,980 --> 00:07:39,390]  Our pool for this average smartphone continues to be quite stable at the $1,500 level.\n",
            "[00:07:39,390 --> 00:07:42,390]  It's actually double of the future phone users, our pool.\n",
            "[00:07:42,390 --> 00:07:48,390]  Usage, we see a slight pickup on the smartphone users' data usage.\n",
            "[00:07:48,390 --> 00:07:55,390]  Right now per month, the smartphone users' data usage is ranged from 1.2 to 1.5 gigabits,\n",
            "[00:07:55,390 --> 00:08:01,830]  and tablet users is between 2 to 3 gigabytes per month.\n",
            "[00:08:01,830 --> 00:08:08,830]  In terms of enterprise, which is quite an important growth engine for us at this moment,\n",
            "[00:08:08,830 --> 00:08:14,830]  we are also happy to report that we continue to grow the enterprise market share from 12.5%\n",
            "[00:08:14,830 --> 00:08:20,830]  at the end of last year until 13.1% at the end of the second quarter.\n",
            "[00:08:20,830 --> 00:08:25,830]  During the quarter, we have successfully acquired some major enterprise accounts,\n",
            "[00:08:25,830 --> 00:08:32,830]  such like Nanya D-Ring, ASD, and TSMC for different projects with those enterprises.\n",
            "[00:08:32,830 --> 00:08:42,460]  I think starting from last year that Verizon has paid a lot of attention into the customer satisfaction,\n",
            "[00:08:42,460 --> 00:08:49,460]  which essentially we want to drive the service excellence culture across the organization.\n",
            "[00:08:49,460 --> 00:08:56,460]  We are also happy to report some very good progress that our retail store,\n",
            "[00:08:56,460 --> 00:09:02,460]  we continue to expand with 350 degree seamless customer services,\n",
            "[00:09:02,460 --> 00:09:07,460]  which resulted in that our in-store services in the first half of the year\n",
            "[00:09:07,460 --> 00:09:14,460]  that we have gained this number one customer satisfaction compared to all our peers in Taiwan.\n",
            "[00:09:14,460 --> 00:09:26,740]  We have been also awarded this year the Golden Service Award in the chain store category by Commercial Times.\n",
            "[00:09:26,740 --> 00:09:31,740]  Last but not the least, aside from all the service awards,\n",
            "[00:09:31,740 --> 00:09:40,740]  in the first half of this year we have received different recognition from different financial sides,\n",
            "[00:09:40,740 --> 00:09:47,740]  which again demonstrates our continued commitment to a solid performance\n",
            "[00:09:47,740 --> 00:09:53,770]  and our transparency to the entire investment world.\n",
            "[00:09:53,770 --> 00:09:59,770]  With this, that concludes my updates for our second quarter results.\n",
            "[00:09:59,770 --> 00:10:02,770]  Right now, I would like to open for any questions.\n",
            "[00:10:02,770 --> 00:10:06,760]  We will now begin our question and answer session.\n",
            "[00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:12,760]  If you have a question for speakers, please press 01 on the telephone keypad and you will enter a queue.\n",
            "[00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:15,760]  After you are announced, please ask your question.\n",
            "[00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:19,760]  If you find that your question has answered before and it's your turn to speak,\n",
            "[00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:22,760]  please press 02 to cancel the question.\n",
            "[00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:33,380]  The first question is from Ravi Charathy from Citi Investor Research.\n",
            "[00:10:33,380 --> 00:10:35,540]  Please go ahead.\n",
            "[00:10:35,540 --> 00:10:37,540]  This is Ravi Charathy from Citi.\n",
            "[00:10:37,540 --> 00:10:40,540]  Congratulations on a great quarter.\n",
            "[00:10:40,540 --> 00:10:42,540]  I have three questions, if I may.\n",
            "[00:10:42,540 --> 00:10:49,540]  The first one is when you talk about the penetration of smartphones within your subscriber base,\n",
            "[00:10:49,540 --> 00:10:52,540]  I just wanted to clarify the definition of smartphones.\n",
            "[00:10:52,540 --> 00:10:58,540]  Is that iOS plus Android but also Symbian, or is it just iOS plus Android?\n",
            "[00:10:59,540 --> 00:11:06,540]  My second question is you used to disclose the percent of your total revenues that come from the apps ecosystem,\n",
            "[00:11:06,540 --> 00:11:13,540]  both apps that you've developed yourself, the music app itself, as well as the 30% you get from the app store.\n",
            "[00:11:13,540 --> 00:11:17,540]  I seem to recall it running at 5.4% in the last quarter.\n",
            "[00:11:17,540 --> 00:11:20,540]  I was wondering if you had an update on that number.\n",
            "[00:11:20,540 --> 00:11:26,540]  My final question, I just wanted to check in terms of the percent of ads for smartphones,\n",
            "[00:11:26,540 --> 00:11:32,540]  so how that splits for the 79% between iOS and Android,\n",
            "[00:11:32,540 --> 00:11:35,540]  and what percent of your net ads are currently coming from tablets,\n",
            "[00:11:35,540 --> 00:11:40,540]  and that would include iPads where you just sell the micro SIM.\n",
            "[00:11:40,540 --> 00:11:42,730]  Thanks a lot.\n",
            "[00:11:42,730 --> 00:11:45,950]  Okay.\n",
            "[00:11:45,950 --> 00:11:50,950]  Let me get back to your definition of smartphone penetration.\n",
            "[00:11:50,950 --> 00:11:56,950]  Our definition of smartphone, let me get down to the detail right away.\n",
            "[00:11:56,950 --> 00:12:03,950]  We have included iOS, Android, and some Windows as well as Symbian,\n",
            "[00:12:03,950 --> 00:12:10,950]  but the total of Symbian and Windows accounts for less than 5% of our smartphones.\n",
            "[00:12:10,950 --> 00:12:12,750]  Got it.\n",
            "[00:12:12,750 --> 00:12:13,750]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:12:13,750 --> 00:12:14,750]  Does that answer your question?\n",
            "[00:12:14,750 --> 00:12:15,750]  It does.\n",
            "[00:12:15,750 --> 00:12:16,750]  Thank you very much.\n",
            "[00:12:16,750 --> 00:12:17,750]  Okay.\n",
            "[00:12:17,750 --> 00:12:22,750]  For your second question, I think can you repeat because you were breaking off.\n",
            "[00:12:22,750 --> 00:12:28,750]  What I heard from you was that you were looking for the breakdown of our mobile data revenue.\n",
            "[00:12:28,750 --> 00:12:29,750]  Yes.\n",
            "[00:12:29,750 --> 00:12:37,750]  You used to give a percentage of your revenues we could triangulate, which was from data.\n",
            "[00:12:37,750 --> 00:12:38,750]  So it was a breakdown of the data revenue.\n",
            "[00:12:38,750 --> 00:12:42,750]  I think if you looked at the apps ecosystem in the last quarter,\n",
            "[00:12:42,750 --> 00:12:46,750]  even though you didn't disclose it explicitly, you disclosed it on the Q&A.\n",
            "[00:12:46,750 --> 00:12:51,750]  It was about 5.5% of your total service revenue coming from the apps ecosystem.\n",
            "[00:12:51,750 --> 00:12:53,750]  Just wanted to check that number again.\n",
            "[00:12:53,750 --> 00:12:54,980]  Okay.\n",
            "[00:12:54,980 --> 00:12:55,980]  Yes.\n",
            "[00:12:55,980 --> 00:12:56,980]  It is about the same.\n",
            "[00:12:56,980 --> 00:12:57,980]  Yes.\n",
            "[00:12:57,980 --> 00:13:03,330]  Because roughly the breakdown would be 60% from text messaging\n",
            "[00:13:03,330 --> 00:13:08,330]  and the other 20% from broadly speaking apps and content.\n",
            "[00:13:08,330 --> 00:13:09,330]  Yes.\n",
            "[00:13:09,330 --> 00:13:11,330]  So the 5% is still about right.\n",
            "[00:13:11,330 --> 00:13:12,330]  That's fantastic.\n",
            "[00:13:12,330 --> 00:13:13,330]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:13:13,330 --> 00:13:17,620]  Okay.\n",
            "[00:13:17,620 --> 00:13:20,620]  The final question was Android versus iOS in your additions,\n",
            "[00:13:20,620 --> 00:13:25,620]  the 79% of subscriber additions that are coming from smartphones.\n",
            "[00:13:25,620 --> 00:13:27,300]  Okay.\n",
            "[00:13:27,300 --> 00:13:32,300]  So in Q2, 20% iOS, 80% Android.\n",
            "[00:13:32,300 --> 00:13:36,440]  Thank you very much.\n",
            "[00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:38,440]  The next question is 92 from Nomura.\n",
            "[00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:40,860]  Please go ahead.\n",
            "[00:13:40,860 --> 00:13:41,860]  Hi.\n",
            "[00:13:41,860 --> 00:13:42,860]  Congratulations on the results.\n",
            "[00:13:42,860 --> 00:13:44,860]  Just three quick questions.\n",
            "[00:13:44,860 --> 00:13:51,860]  First is with regards to the improvement of the EBITDA margin in 2Q,\n",
            "[00:13:51,860 --> 00:13:53,860]  can you help us to better understand,\n",
            "[00:13:53,860 --> 00:13:56,860]  is it just mainly because of the strong revenue growth\n",
            "[00:13:56,860 --> 00:14:02,860]  or there are specific cost control measures that the company has put in place\n",
            "[00:14:02,860 --> 00:14:09,860]  that the EBITDA margin expands so much between 1Q this year and 2Q that you just reported?\n",
            "[00:14:09,860 --> 00:14:11,860]  That's my first question.\n",
            "[00:14:11,860 --> 00:14:16,860]  Second question would be since we don't have the detailed financial statements in front of us,\n",
            "[00:14:17,860 --> 00:14:21,860]  what are the key items between EBITDA and net profit?\n",
            "[00:14:21,860 --> 00:14:29,860]  Because I noticed that your EBITDA for 2Q exceeds your own guidance by a bit,\n",
            "[00:14:29,860 --> 00:14:32,860]  but then your net profit exceeded by a significant amount.\n",
            "[00:14:32,860 --> 00:14:36,860]  So what are the items below EBITDA that help the net profit\n",
            "[00:14:36,860 --> 00:14:39,860]  came in much ahead of your own guidance?\n",
            "[00:14:39,860 --> 00:14:44,860]  And the final question would be with regards to recent market news\n",
            "[00:14:44,860 --> 00:14:50,860]  suggesting that the company may consider making a strategic investment into FITEL.\n",
            "[00:14:50,860 --> 00:14:55,860]  I just want to know is the company open to this kind of potential investment\n",
            "[00:14:55,860 --> 00:15:00,860]  or is definitely a no that I should take from the management\n",
            "[00:15:00,860 --> 00:15:04,860]  that Firestone will never consider making investment into FITEL?\n",
            "[00:15:04,860 --> 00:15:05,860]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:15:05,860 --> 00:15:08,530]  Danny, this is TYR.\n",
            "[00:15:08,530 --> 00:15:10,530]  I'll take your question one and two.\n",
            "[00:15:10,530 --> 00:15:14,530]  For your question number one, which is related to the expansion of EBITDA\n",
            "[00:15:14,530 --> 00:15:20,530]  and actually this is a classical example of operational leverage\n",
            "[00:15:20,530 --> 00:15:26,560]  whereby our revenue was growing faster than our cost and expense\n",
            "[00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:32,560]  and therefore we were able to translate the majority of that revenue growth into the EBITDA line.\n",
            "[00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:38,560]  And specifically, if I get down to the items included in the cost and expense,\n",
            "[00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:44,560]  actually we saw a broad-based improvement in cost items such as peering cost,\n",
            "[00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:48,590]  such as interconnect, such as content cost.\n",
            "[00:15:48,590 --> 00:15:54,590]  And we also saw improvement in the expense items such as G&A as well as sales and marketing.\n",
            "[00:15:54,590 --> 00:15:57,590]  So again, it is a broad-based improvement.\n",
            "[00:15:57,590 --> 00:16:06,590]  And if you compare Q2 versus Q1, there is an iPhone impact there\n",
            "[00:16:06,590 --> 00:16:09,590]  because in Q1 we saw a lot of iPhone 4S\n",
            "[00:16:09,590 --> 00:16:16,590]  and you know iPhone 4S always comes with the highest absolute value of subsidy.\n",
            "[00:16:16,590 --> 00:16:23,880]  And therefore, when we saw less iPhone 4S in Q2, that also helped our EBITDA expansion.\n",
            "[00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:26,880]  And with regard to your second question,\n",
            "[00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:30,880]  which is related to the line items between EBITDA and net income,\n",
            "[00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:35,880]  that's essentially one, depreciation, and two, non-operating.\n",
            "[00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:42,980]  And non-operating would include write-off of our telecom equipment.\n",
            "[00:16:42,980 --> 00:16:50,420]  And where we exceeded our guidance in this year is actually our depreciation.\n",
            "[00:16:50,420 --> 00:16:56,570]  Our depreciation came in lower versus our forecast.\n",
            "[00:16:56,570 --> 00:17:00,570]  If I may just jump in to ask an additional question at this point\n",
            "[00:17:00,570 --> 00:17:04,570]  before Yvonne addresses my last question.\n",
            "[00:17:04,570 --> 00:17:09,570]  When you mentioned that depreciation expense coming lower than your initial forecast,\n",
            "[00:17:09,570 --> 00:17:16,570]  is it because the company is incurring capex at a slower pace than previous guidance\n",
            "[00:17:16,570 --> 00:17:22,570]  or what are the reasons why depreciation expense coming lower than your initial expectation?\n",
            "[00:17:22,570 --> 00:17:24,730]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:17:25,730 --> 00:17:30,730]  I think it's just that when we model our depreciation expense,\n",
            "[00:17:30,730 --> 00:17:33,780]  we were on the conservative side.\n",
            "[00:17:33,780 --> 00:17:39,500]  There is nothing much more to it.\n",
            "[00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:40,500]  Okay.\n",
            "[00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:45,500]  Danny, regarding your question for whatever the media news,\n",
            "[00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:50,500]  regarding Barisong is in talk with PHS,\n",
            "[00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:56,500]  I can say to you that right now Barisong is not engaging in any discussion with PHS\n",
            "[00:17:56,500 --> 00:18:03,500]  on a strategic cooperation or even on the merger and acquisition kind of a discussion.\n",
            "[00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:10,050]  It's purely media news, which there is no wrong at all.\n",
            "[00:18:10,050 --> 00:18:13,050]  But what if, if I may ask the hypothetical question,\n",
            "[00:18:13,050 --> 00:18:19,050]  what if Catholic American Fighter is open to a discussion tomorrow?\n",
            "[00:18:19,050 --> 00:18:23,360]  Will Frystone be interested?\n",
            "[00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:25,360]  I do not think so,\n",
            "[00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:28,360]  because first of all that the Fightel,\n",
            "[00:18:28,360 --> 00:18:33,360]  I think you know that they are still in their restructuring process,\n",
            "[00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:41,360]  which I think is a bit too complicated for Frystone at this point of time for us to really comprehend.\n",
            "[00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:48,360]  And also that they are engaged in PHS technology,\n",
            "[00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:54,360]  and what we have done is a kind of operational cooperation with them\n",
            "[00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:58,360]  where they want to shut down their PHS kind of a network.\n",
            "[00:18:58,360 --> 00:19:08,360]  They become our sales channel that actually can help them to generate some of the commission revenues\n",
            "[00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:15,360]  and where they can kind of transform their customers into the Barisong customer.\n",
            "[00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:20,360]  This is on the basis that right now majority of the PHS users,\n",
            "[00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:22,360]  they are dual scene users.\n",
            "[00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:27,360]  So anyhow, they have another thing which is the current mobile operators.\n",
            "[00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:31,360]  So that's right now the only thing.\n",
            "[00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:38,360]  So there is no intention for any merger acquisition discussion with Fightel.\n",
            "[00:19:38,360 --> 00:19:43,610]  If I may, sorry if I may ask a follow-up question.\n",
            "[00:19:43,610 --> 00:19:47,610]  You mentioned that like right now there is some kind of cooperation\n",
            "[00:19:48,610 --> 00:19:54,610]  that Fightel may transfer some of their PHS subscriber onto your mobile platform.\n",
            "[00:19:54,610 --> 00:19:58,610]  Are there any particular reasons why like Fightel,\n",
            "[00:19:58,610 --> 00:20:06,020]  those customers will not so-called transfer to Chung Wah or Taiwan Mobile's mobile platform?\n",
            "[00:20:06,020 --> 00:20:08,570]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:20:08,570 --> 00:20:14,570]  This is because that I think it's on their channel.\n",
            "[00:20:14,570 --> 00:20:17,570]  I think when they probably discussed with Chung Wah,\n",
            "[00:20:17,570 --> 00:20:21,570]  Chung Wah never really engaged in open channel as their sales agent.\n",
            "[00:20:21,570 --> 00:20:26,570]  So this is more like how traditionally Chung Wah is operating their channel.\n",
            "[00:20:26,570 --> 00:20:32,570]  And for Taiwan Mobile, because they have enough, I think their own retail store,\n",
            "[00:20:32,570 --> 00:20:43,570]  so they have probably no interest engaging with PHS to engage PHS as one of their sales agents.\n",
            "[00:20:43,570 --> 00:20:47,570]  So for Fightel, I think this is a win-win to both sides.\n",
            "[00:20:47,570 --> 00:20:50,570]  One side that PHS can earn certain commission revenue,\n",
            "[00:20:50,570 --> 00:20:54,570]  on the other side can help Fightel to generate some new customers.\n",
            "[00:20:54,570 --> 00:20:59,570]  So I think this is a purely kind of a channel collaboration.\n",
            "[00:20:59,570 --> 00:21:04,190]  Okay, thank you.\n",
            "[00:21:04,190 --> 00:21:07,190]  The next question is Arnavit Ramachandran from Barclays, Hong Kong.\n",
            "[00:21:07,190 --> 00:21:08,190]  Please go ahead.\n",
            "[00:21:08,190 --> 00:21:10,190]  Yes, hi. Thank you for the call.\n",
            "[00:21:10,190 --> 00:21:12,190]  I had two questions.\n",
            "[00:21:12,190 --> 00:21:19,190]  Firstly, on the fixed line side, top line growth has accelerated to about 15%.\n",
            "[00:21:19,190 --> 00:21:22,190]  Margins have also shown a remarkable increase.\n",
            "[00:21:22,190 --> 00:21:26,190]  So I was wondering if you could give us some color on what drives that top line growth\n",
            "[00:21:26,190 --> 00:21:28,190]  and the margin increase.\n",
            "[00:21:28,190 --> 00:21:30,190]  That's question one.\n",
            "[00:21:30,190 --> 00:21:35,190]  Question two, on the mobile side, as you come off the iPhone costs,\n",
            "[00:21:35,190 --> 00:21:39,190]  you have seen top line maintain momentum, you've seen margins improve.\n",
            "[00:21:39,190 --> 00:21:43,190]  So I'm wondering whether we should read anything into the mix,\n",
            "[00:21:43,190 --> 00:21:48,190]  i.e., if you start taking other mid-end handsets, smartphones in the mix,\n",
            "[00:21:48,190 --> 00:21:52,190]  are they still driving the same level of revenues but coming with lower costs?\n",
            "[00:21:52,190 --> 00:21:57,190]  So I'm just wondering if there's some color in that in terms of rising margins\n",
            "[00:21:57,190 --> 00:21:58,190]  that we should be thinking about.\n",
            "[00:21:58,190 --> 00:21:59,190]  Thanks.\n",
            "[00:21:59,190 --> 00:22:03,890]  On your first question, fixed line improvement driver,\n",
            "[00:22:03,890 --> 00:22:08,890]  on the top line, as Yvonne alluded to in the presentation,\n",
            "[00:22:09,890 --> 00:22:13,890]  in Q2 we landed some major corporate accounts.\n",
            "[00:22:13,890 --> 00:22:19,890]  And if I translate those new business into our specific fixed line offerings,\n",
            "[00:22:19,890 --> 00:22:26,240]  in Q2 we did see good performance in our fixed line business,\n",
            "[00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:33,240]  such as VPN, Lease Line, Data Center, as well as MVPN.\n",
            "[00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:36,240]  I'm sorry, as well as our FTDP business.\n",
            "[00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:42,340]  And, therefore, these drove our revenue to grow about 10%.\n",
            "[00:22:42,340 --> 00:22:45,340]  And in terms of margin, it's very encouraging,\n",
            "[00:22:45,340 --> 00:22:49,340]  because for business such as Data Center or Lease Line,\n",
            "[00:22:49,340 --> 00:22:53,340]  actually the cost was about there.\n",
            "[00:22:53,340 --> 00:22:56,340]  And, therefore, when we generated incremental revenue,\n",
            "[00:22:56,340 --> 00:22:59,340]  the incremental cost was actually very low.\n",
            "[00:22:59,340 --> 00:23:05,340]  And, therefore, we could easily drive those top line growth into our margin\n",
            "[00:23:05,340 --> 00:23:07,340]  expansion.\n",
            "[00:23:07,340 --> 00:23:10,650]  Understood.\n",
            "[00:23:10,650 --> 00:23:19,540]  And on your second question, it's about the iPhone 4S.\n",
            "[00:23:19,540 --> 00:23:21,540]  As you can see in our Q2 result,\n",
            "[00:23:21,540 --> 00:23:26,540]  we did see further margin expansion reflected in our EBITDA dollars.\n",
            "[00:23:26,540 --> 00:23:30,540]  And for Q3, as we can see now,\n",
            "[00:23:30,540 --> 00:23:33,540]  the higher tier smartphone pipeline kind of thing,\n",
            "[00:23:33,540 --> 00:23:38,540]  right now the strongest selling one is actually Samsung Galaxy S3.\n",
            "[00:23:38,540 --> 00:23:45,540]  And we did see a slight decrease in terms of higher tier smartphone in Q2.\n",
            "[00:23:45,540 --> 00:23:52,540]  For Q3, we expect that we continue to generate the same kind of mix as we did in Q2.\n",
            "[00:23:52,540 --> 00:23:53,900]  Okay.\n",
            "[00:23:53,900 --> 00:23:57,900]  If I could follow up, could you tell us what was the mix between, let's say,\n",
            "[00:23:57,900 --> 00:24:00,900]  high-end, mid-end, low-end of smartphones in Q2,\n",
            "[00:24:00,900 --> 00:24:03,900]  or maybe in your subscriber base, which was easier?\n",
            "[00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:08,950]  In Q2, in Q1, let me refresh you a little bit.\n",
            "[00:24:08,950 --> 00:24:14,950]  In Q1, 60% in high-end, 25% in mid-end, and 15% in low-end.\n",
            "[00:24:14,950 --> 00:24:19,950]  And in Q2, 45% high-end, 35% mid-end.\n",
            "[00:24:19,950 --> 00:24:23,800]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:27,800]  And is there any significant output differential between high-end versus\n",
            "[00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:29,800]  medium-end versus low-end?\n",
            "[00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:33,150]  iPhone, of course, is the highest.\n",
            "[00:24:33,150 --> 00:24:38,500]  But other than iPhone, we saw little difference between high-end and mid-end.\n",
            "[00:24:38,500 --> 00:24:39,860]  Understood.\n",
            "[00:24:39,860 --> 00:24:40,860]  Thank you so much.\n",
            "[00:24:40,860 --> 00:24:45,550]  The next question is Chetan from Credit Suisse.\n",
            "[00:24:45,550 --> 00:24:46,550]  Please go ahead.\n",
            "[00:24:46,550 --> 00:24:47,840]  Hi.\n",
            "[00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:50,840]  Good afternoon, and congratulations on the strong result.\n",
            "[00:24:50,840 --> 00:24:53,840]  Thank you so much for the opportunity to ask the question.\n",
            "[00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:55,840]  I have in total four questions.\n",
            "[00:24:55,840 --> 00:25:01,840]  Just one follow-up question from my peers previously who asked about the fixed line.\n",
            "[00:25:02,840 --> 00:25:07,840]  So, basically, your message is that the fixed line EBITDA margin improvement is sustainable.\n",
            "[00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:12,870]  So, we should be able to expect fixed line EBITDA margin to stay at this level\n",
            "[00:25:12,870 --> 00:25:14,870]  and could improve from here.\n",
            "[00:25:14,870 --> 00:25:19,030]  The second question is regarding your guidance.\n",
            "[00:25:19,030 --> 00:25:22,030]  It seems like you are bidding your guidance right now.\n",
            "[00:25:22,030 --> 00:25:26,030]  Into the third and the fourth quarter, have you already built in the potential\n",
            "[00:25:26,030 --> 00:25:31,030]  launch of iPhone 5, which I would think that it would hurt your margins,\n",
            "[00:25:31,030 --> 00:25:34,030]  at least in the near term, into your guidance already?\n",
            "[00:25:34,030 --> 00:25:40,030]  The third question, maybe I'm reading too much into this, but within your presentation,\n",
            "[00:25:40,030 --> 00:25:46,030]  you are suggesting that the average usage for a smartphone right now is 1.2 to 1.5 GB.\n",
            "[00:25:46,030 --> 00:25:53,030]  If I remember correctly, in your previous quarter, we are talking about an average of around 1 GB.\n",
            "[00:25:53,030 --> 00:26:00,030]  Is it a real increase in usage, meaning you are really seeing an increase in average data per user?\n",
            "[00:26:00,030 --> 00:26:08,320]  And if that is the case, would you kindly advise on if there have been some popular applications\n",
            "[00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:13,320]  or the new handsets or how the user's behavior actually changed,\n",
            "[00:26:13,320 --> 00:26:16,320]  or it's just an outright use more data kind of thing?\n",
            "[00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:21,420]  And the last question is on the bigger picture.\n",
            "[00:26:21,420 --> 00:26:27,420]  We have seen some effort from other markets in moving away from unlimited data pricing.\n",
            "[00:26:28,420 --> 00:26:29,420]  What's your view on this?\n",
            "[00:26:29,420 --> 00:26:34,420]  And how far is Taiwan, in your opinion, from actually execute the same thing,\n",
            "[00:26:34,420 --> 00:26:38,420]  stop unlimited data pricing and introduce some tiers?\n",
            "[00:26:38,420 --> 00:26:39,420]  Thank you very much.\n",
            "[00:26:39,420 --> 00:26:43,250]  Okay, I'll answer your first two questions.\n",
            "[00:26:43,250 --> 00:26:49,250]  On the fixed line EBITDA margin percentage, in Q2, we were approaching 25%.\n",
            "[00:26:49,250 --> 00:26:57,470]  And we have always guided that we will manage our fixed line business to generate about 20% to 25% EBITDA margin\n",
            "[00:26:57,470 --> 00:27:01,470]  because on one hand, we want to sustain a good EBITDA margin,\n",
            "[00:27:01,470 --> 00:27:05,470]  but on the other hand, we want to make sure that we grow our market share as well.\n",
            "[00:27:05,470 --> 00:27:12,890]  We do see enterprise segment, which is the majority source of where we generate our fixed line business.\n",
            "[00:27:12,890 --> 00:27:18,890]  We do see enterprise to be our main drive growth engine.\n",
            "[00:27:18,890 --> 00:27:25,890]  And your second question with regards to whether our guidance did include iPhone 5.\n",
            "[00:27:25,890 --> 00:27:31,890]  If you look at our guidance for 2012, and specifically if you look into the quarterly breakdown,\n",
            "[00:27:31,890 --> 00:27:36,890]  actually we did not incorporate iPhone 5 in our guidance.\n",
            "[00:27:36,890 --> 00:27:43,500]  Up until end of Q2, we are tracking ahead of our guidance.\n",
            "[00:27:43,500 --> 00:27:48,500]  And what I can communicate to you right now is we take one quarter at a time,\n",
            "[00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:53,500]  so we make sure that every quarter we execute to the best that we can.\n",
            "[00:27:53,500 --> 00:28:00,660]  And when iPhone 5 comes along, we manage that color of our guidance definitely.\n",
            "[00:28:00,660 --> 00:28:03,100]  Okay.\n",
            "[00:28:03,100 --> 00:28:10,100]  Regarding your third question, the increasing customer usage on the data traffic,\n",
            "[00:28:10,100 --> 00:28:16,100]  I should not say we see a significant change, but we do see more and more customers\n",
            "[00:28:16,100 --> 00:28:23,100]  that they are watching different kinds of videos through their smart devices.\n",
            "[00:28:23,100 --> 00:28:34,100]  So I think this is the main driver of the slight increase of the customer usage on the data traffic.\n",
            "[00:28:34,100 --> 00:28:43,100]  In terms of unlimited data pricing so far, although this has been discussed in this market for some time,\n",
            "[00:28:43,100 --> 00:28:51,380]  but so far we do not really see any tangible movements in this direction.\n",
            "[00:28:51,380 --> 00:28:59,380]  I think the NCC commissioner, hopefully by tomorrow we will have the next term,\n",
            "[00:28:59,380 --> 00:29:02,380]  the NCC commissioner being elected.\n",
            "[00:29:02,380 --> 00:29:07,380]  I certainly believe that with the new commissioners on board,\n",
            "[00:29:07,380 --> 00:29:14,800]  with continuing evolving on the mobile broadband, that issue will be addressed again.\n",
            "[00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:21,750]  But at this moment, so far there is no concrete movement yet.\n",
            "[00:29:21,750 --> 00:29:22,750]  Thank you so much.\n",
            "[00:29:22,750 --> 00:29:26,750]  Just one follow-up question regarding the fixed line.\n",
            "[00:29:26,750 --> 00:29:27,750]  Okay.\n",
            "[00:29:27,750 --> 00:29:29,750]  I understand that the enterprise would be the key driver.\n",
            "[00:29:29,750 --> 00:29:36,750]  So what kind of EBITDA margin you are generating specifically on the enterprise segment that we are talking about?\n",
            "[00:29:36,750 --> 00:29:38,750]  Is it closer to 20%?\n",
            "[00:29:38,750 --> 00:29:43,750]  And that is why you are guiding for 20% to 25% EBITDA margin.\n",
            "[00:29:43,750 --> 00:29:44,750]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:29:44,750 --> 00:29:47,300]  You are correct.\n",
            "[00:29:47,300 --> 00:29:51,160]  The enterprise is about 20%.\n",
            "[00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:52,320]  All right.\n",
            "[00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:53,320]  Perfect.\n",
            "[00:29:53,320 --> 00:29:56,460]  Thank you very much.\n",
            "[00:29:56,460 --> 00:29:59,460]  The next question is Neil Empson from HSBC.\n",
            "[00:29:59,460 --> 00:30:00,460]  Please go ahead.\n",
            "[00:30:00,460 --> 00:30:02,460]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:30:02,460 --> 00:30:03,460]  Two questions, please.\n",
            "[00:30:03,460 --> 00:30:06,460]  Firstly, just coming back to mobile margins,\n",
            "[00:30:06,460 --> 00:30:12,460]  and you have seen obviously a strong improvement from 1Q to 2Q, about 300 basis points.\n",
            "[00:30:12,460 --> 00:30:16,460]  But I think the margin in the second quarter is about 29%.\n",
            "[00:30:16,460 --> 00:30:20,460]  So even with the reduction in iPhone 4S sales and a better mix,\n",
            "[00:30:20,460 --> 00:30:26,460]  that is still actually lower, I think, than the third and fourth quarter of last year, which were above 30%.\n",
            "[00:30:26,460 --> 00:30:30,490]  So my question is, do you see margins going back to 30%?\n",
            "[00:30:30,490 --> 00:30:32,490]  And what is the main factor here?\n",
            "[00:30:32,490 --> 00:30:37,490]  Is it still iPhone 4S sales in the second quarter that kept margins down?\n",
            "[00:30:37,490 --> 00:30:39,650]  That is my first question.\n",
            "[00:30:39,650 --> 00:30:45,650]  The second one relates to CapEx, and your run rate so far in the first half is about $4.9 billion.\n",
            "[00:30:46,650 --> 00:30:51,650]  That is sort of running ahead of, I think, the original guidance for CapEx for this year,\n",
            "[00:30:51,650 --> 00:30:54,650]  which if I remember correctly is about $8.7 billion.\n",
            "[00:30:54,650 --> 00:30:56,650]  So could you give us your thoughts on CapEx?\n",
            "[00:30:56,650 --> 00:31:00,650]  Is this just seasonality you're ahead in the first half,\n",
            "[00:31:00,650 --> 00:31:04,650]  or are you needing to spend a bit more on the network to manage the data demand?\n",
            "[00:31:04,650 --> 00:31:09,240]  Thanks very much.\n",
            "[00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:14,740]  On your mobile margin question,\n",
            "[00:31:14,740 --> 00:31:22,740]  I think now we like to have you focus more on the actual EBITDA dollars rather than just the margin percentage.\n",
            "[00:31:22,740 --> 00:31:28,740]  And the reason is really with now more and more device revenue that we are generating,\n",
            "[00:31:28,740 --> 00:31:31,740]  it is a very different dynamic.\n",
            "[00:31:31,740 --> 00:31:36,740]  And therefore, if you focus solely on the margin percentage,\n",
            "[00:31:36,740 --> 00:31:42,740]  that could be diluted by the fact that we are selling a whole lot more devices.\n",
            "[00:31:42,740 --> 00:31:48,780]  And specifically, if you want to compare versus our Q3 or Q4 last year,\n",
            "[00:31:48,780 --> 00:31:57,870]  actually currently the trend is such that our absolute EBITDA dollar is growing significantly year over year.\n",
            "[00:31:57,870 --> 00:32:08,480]  And internally, we did an analysis to compare our EBITDA margin percentage now versus two years ago.\n",
            "[00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:16,220]  And because of the a lot higher device revenue that we are generating,\n",
            "[00:32:16,220 --> 00:32:22,220]  if I normalize my device revenue to be about the same level as we had two years ago,\n",
            "[00:32:22,220 --> 00:32:28,220]  actually my EBITDA margin would go up by about three to four percentage points.\n",
            "[00:32:28,220 --> 00:32:38,270]  So I would like for you to focus more on the EBITDA dollar as well as EBITDA percentage rather than just EBITDA percentage.\n",
            "[00:32:38,270 --> 00:32:41,270]  And second is on your CAPEX.\n",
            "[00:32:41,270 --> 00:32:47,270]  For this year, we are still very confident that we'll be able to manage CAPEX within our guidance,\n",
            "[00:32:47,270 --> 00:32:52,270]  which is $8.7 billion in terms of the absolute guidance.\n",
            "[00:32:52,270 --> 00:33:01,780]  We have always communicated that FEP is going to manage our CAPEX within 10% to 12% of our total revenue.\n",
            "[00:33:01,780 --> 00:33:09,780]  And for 2012, the $8.7 billion CAPEX budget was about 10.7% of our total revenue.\n",
            "[00:33:09,780 --> 00:33:13,780]  And in the first six months, we did spend ahead of the curve\n",
            "[00:33:13,780 --> 00:33:20,780]  because we wanted to implement our deployment plan as soon as possible.\n",
            "[00:33:20,780 --> 00:33:23,780]  But even with slightly ahead of the curve,\n",
            "[00:33:23,780 --> 00:33:32,780]  our actual CAPEX as percentage of our total revenue for first half was only about 11.7%.\n",
            "[00:33:32,780 --> 00:33:37,780]  So it was still well within our 10% to 12% guidance.\n",
            "[00:33:37,780 --> 00:33:42,180]  Thank you. That's very clear.\n",
            "[00:33:42,180 --> 00:33:46,180]  The next question is Stephen Liu from Standard Chartered Bank. Please go ahead.\n",
            "[00:33:46,180 --> 00:33:48,720]  Thank you. I have three questions.\n",
            "[00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:56,720]  The first one regarding the LTE, any details or plans can you share with us about your LTE progress?\n",
            "[00:33:56,720 --> 00:34:01,720]  And I know you have the Wi-Fi spectrum, and maybe it's good for the TD LTE.\n",
            "[00:34:01,720 --> 00:34:09,720]  So in the future, will you be focused on FDD or like the DMO TDD, FDD in the future?\n",
            "[00:34:09,720 --> 00:34:17,720]  What's your best estimate on the timing of commercial trial in the LTE network?\n",
            "[00:34:17,720 --> 00:34:28,720]  The second question regarding any progress in China Mobile proposal to buy five-tone stick following the election in Taiwan.\n",
            "[00:34:28,720 --> 00:34:35,720]  And the third question regarding how much data traffic was offloaded by your Wi-Fi network in the second quarter.\n",
            "[00:34:35,720 --> 00:34:38,160]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:34:38,160 --> 00:34:48,380]  Okay. Regarding the LTE, the roadmap in Taiwan, the government right now based on our understanding,\n",
            "[00:34:48,380 --> 00:34:57,380]  by end of this year, the government will issue some guiding principles on the 4G,\n",
            "[00:34:57,380 --> 00:35:04,860]  and hopefully by mid-next year that they will issue out the auction rule.\n",
            "[00:35:04,860 --> 00:35:09,860]  So I think latest, latest, I think by the mid of 2014.\n",
            "[00:35:09,860 --> 00:35:18,050]  And maybe pre-point to the end of next year that the license can be issued out.\n",
            "[00:35:19,050 --> 00:35:26,050]  I think all the operator will be granted for like two years to complete this commercial deployment.\n",
            "[00:35:26,050 --> 00:35:32,050]  So that's roughly the timeline we obtained from the government.\n",
            "[00:35:32,050 --> 00:35:38,050]  But of course, until the government really announced the game rules,\n",
            "[00:35:38,050 --> 00:35:44,050]  we never knew that whether there will be any change likely on the timeline.\n",
            "[00:35:45,210 --> 00:35:54,210]  Regarding the WiMAX spectrum, so far we have not obtained any so-called concrete answers from the government\n",
            "[00:35:54,210 --> 00:35:59,210]  whether this spectrum can be used to deploy the TDLTE.\n",
            "[00:35:59,210 --> 00:36:04,210]  So hopefully that by end of this year when government announced their game rules,\n",
            "[00:36:04,210 --> 00:36:11,210]  we will know clearly whether this spectrum can be actually transformed into the TDLTE spectrum.\n",
            "[00:36:11,210 --> 00:36:15,210]  Okay, so that's a little bit on the LTE update.\n",
            "[00:36:15,210 --> 00:36:19,210]  On the CMCC deal, so far there is no progress.\n",
            "[00:36:19,210 --> 00:36:23,210]  So it's still standing still there.\n",
            "[00:36:23,210 --> 00:36:26,210]  Your last question regarding the Wi-Fi.\n",
            "[00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:36,470]  Okay, thank you very much.\n",
            "[00:36:36,470 --> 00:36:41,950]  The next question is Julian Mayer from Charlemagne Capital. Please go ahead.\n",
            "[00:36:41,950 --> 00:36:44,950]  One question regarding regulation.\n",
            "[00:36:44,950 --> 00:36:50,950]  You mentioned in your earlier discussion about the postpaid ARPUs and postpaid minutes\n",
            "[00:36:50,950 --> 00:36:55,950]  that you had strong numbers despite a negative impact of regulatory pressure,\n",
            "[00:36:55,950 --> 00:36:57,950]  I think it was your words from the second quarter.\n",
            "[00:36:57,950 --> 00:37:01,950]  Can you elaborate on this pressure from the regulators?\n",
            "[00:37:01,950 --> 00:37:06,950]  You mentioned already with respect to data, but also other issues such as, for example,\n",
            "[00:37:07,950 --> 00:37:14,950]  you referred to the falling market share in the weaker players, ABPW and VEBO.\n",
            "[00:37:14,950 --> 00:37:18,950]  So if you could just maybe comment on the regulatory environment overall\n",
            "[00:37:18,950 --> 00:37:24,950]  and how you see that panning out over the next year or two. Thank you.\n",
            "[00:37:24,950 --> 00:37:31,740]  Okay. The government pressure right now on the pricing,\n",
            "[00:37:31,740 --> 00:37:36,740]  I feel up to now it's still pretty much on the mobile side,\n",
            "[00:37:36,740 --> 00:37:47,310]  pretty much still focusing on the mobile voice and also on the short message.\n",
            "[00:37:47,310 --> 00:37:54,310]  You know that in the past six years that the Taiwan mobile sector has a subjective value adjustment.\n",
            "[00:37:54,310 --> 00:37:58,310]  So next year will be another starting point.\n",
            "[00:37:58,310 --> 00:38:02,310]  But so far because the NCC commission is under the change,\n",
            "[00:38:02,310 --> 00:38:08,310]  so we still don't know whether the future directions and how the NCC the next term,\n",
            "[00:38:08,310 --> 00:38:12,310]  they are going to further control on the mobile voice pricing.\n",
            "[00:38:12,310 --> 00:38:21,920]  So far the government has not come in to control the so-called mobile broadband pricing,\n",
            "[00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:24,920]  and I do not believe they will come into this.\n",
            "[00:38:24,920 --> 00:38:31,920]  Because right now I think their focus is for all the operator to ensure a good mobile broadband quality,\n",
            "[00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:38,920]  which is we got to have a certain speed to ensure the customer experience is good.\n",
            "[00:38:38,920 --> 00:38:44,920]  So I do not see that in short term they will come in to control the mobile broadband pricing.\n",
            "[00:38:44,920 --> 00:38:48,920]  On the other hand, I think on the fixed broadband pricing,\n",
            "[00:38:48,920 --> 00:38:53,920]  this is the area that the government continues to give pressure,\n",
            "[00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:57,920]  particularly to Zhonghua Telecom for the fixed broadband pricing.\n",
            "[00:38:57,920 --> 00:39:02,920]  So I think this part, I think they will continue to drive it down,\n",
            "[00:39:02,920 --> 00:39:08,920]  to actually meet the president's mark, their future policy,\n",
            "[00:39:08,920 --> 00:39:18,920]  which is by year-end of 2015, 80% of the households in Taiwan can enjoy 100 megabit speed\n",
            "[00:39:18,920 --> 00:39:24,940]  in terms of the fixed broadband and with a good pricing.\n",
            "[00:39:24,940 --> 00:39:25,940]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:39:25,940 --> 00:39:28,180]  Okay.\n",
            "[00:39:28,180 --> 00:39:30,180]  The next question is Gary Yu from Morgan Stanley.\n",
            "[00:39:30,180 --> 00:39:32,180]  Please go ahead.\n",
            "[00:39:32,180 --> 00:39:33,180]  Hi.\n",
            "[00:39:33,180 --> 00:39:37,180]  Thank you for the opportunity to ask questions and congratulations on the strong result.\n",
            "[00:39:37,180 --> 00:39:41,180]  I have two questions, both for the mobile side.\n",
            "[00:39:41,180 --> 00:39:50,180]  First is you mentioned that the proportion of mid- to low-end smartphones has been a rising trend compared to the last quarter.\n",
            "[00:39:50,180 --> 00:39:54,180]  Given the output are similar but subsidies are lower,\n",
            "[00:39:55,180 --> 00:40:00,180]  do you expect further improvement in mobile margin in the second half and also going into next year,\n",
            "[00:40:00,180 --> 00:40:05,180]  assuming you don't have the next iPhone impact or margin?\n",
            "[00:40:05,180 --> 00:40:09,180]  The second question I have is more on the competition side.\n",
            "[00:40:09,180 --> 00:40:15,180]  Given you have been gaining market share from both Zhonghua and Taiwan Mobile,\n",
            "[00:40:15,180 --> 00:40:26,180]  have you been seeing any new marketing campaigns or any new initiatives from these two companies to regain market share from you?\n",
            "[00:40:26,180 --> 00:40:34,180]  And the other issue which I also want to discuss is with regard to the two smaller operators,\n",
            "[00:40:35,180 --> 00:40:48,180]  what are the exact marketing tactics that management has used in the past couple of quarters in terms of gaining customers from those two smaller operators?\n",
            "[00:40:48,180 --> 00:40:54,180]  I think Firestone has been doing better jobs compared to other operators in terms of gaining customers as well.\n",
            "[00:40:54,180 --> 00:40:57,710]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:40:57,710 --> 00:41:01,710]  Gary, let me answer your second question first.\n",
            "[00:41:01,710 --> 00:41:07,710]  We did see some competition activity heat up lately.\n",
            "[00:41:07,710 --> 00:41:13,710]  For FET, I would believe it all comes down to the ability to execute.\n",
            "[00:41:13,710 --> 00:41:22,710]  Especially one thing that we feel very proud at FET is our ability to upsell at our retail store.\n",
            "[00:41:22,710 --> 00:41:33,710]  When our customers come into the store, we are able to upsell to our customer to a higher bracket of the rate plan.\n",
            "[00:41:33,710 --> 00:41:39,710]  And therefore, if you look at what we have achieved this year, specifically for the mobile service revenue,\n",
            "[00:41:39,710 --> 00:41:45,710]  every month we added about the same incremental mobile retail revenue as our peer company.\n",
            "[00:41:45,710 --> 00:41:59,710]  But on the other hand, we have demonstrated that we are best at the ability to keep our voice revenue intact without being impacted by the mandatory tariff cuts.\n",
            "[00:41:59,710 --> 00:42:08,710]  And therefore, despite the fact that there has been some newer marketing campaigns coming out of our peer company,\n",
            "[00:42:08,710 --> 00:42:17,940]  we believe our ability to execute at our storefront will sustain what we have achieved in the first half of this year.\n",
            "[00:42:17,940 --> 00:42:27,940]  And with that, actually, going back to your question number one, in Q2, we did build our EBITDA.\n",
            "[00:42:27,940 --> 00:42:33,940]  We expanded our EBITDA more than our Q1 performance.\n",
            "[00:42:33,940 --> 00:42:42,940]  And for Q3 and Q4, at this point in time, we do see lighter high-tier smartphone pipelines.\n",
            "[00:42:42,940 --> 00:42:45,220]  So it's an opportunity.\n",
            "[00:42:45,220 --> 00:42:53,220]  But again, EBITDA, we are not going to change our guidance at this point in time for the rest of the year.\n",
            "[00:42:53,220 --> 00:42:59,220]  Again, we are going to execute the best that we could, and we take one quarter at a time.\n",
            "[00:42:59,220 --> 00:43:04,010]  Okay, thank you.\n",
            "[00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:10,000]  As a reminder, please press 01 on your telephone keypad for questions.\n",
            "[00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:13,000]  The next question is Lucy Liu from JP Morgan.\n",
            "[00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:15,670]  Please go ahead.\n",
            "[00:43:15,670 --> 00:43:17,670]  Hi, thank you very much for taking my questions.\n",
            "[00:43:17,670 --> 00:43:19,670]  I have two questions.\n",
            "[00:43:19,670 --> 00:43:24,670]  One is also on the mobile data revenue and also smartphone penetration.\n",
            "[00:43:24,670 --> 00:43:33,670]  So we're very delighted to see that overall Taiwan telcos have been growing the smartphone penetration quite rapidly, like 1 percentage point per month.\n",
            "[00:43:33,670 --> 00:43:37,670]  So just wondering how long do you think this trend can last,\n",
            "[00:43:37,670 --> 00:43:47,670]  and what will be the point that we potentially will see a slowdown momentum from both smartphone penetration as well as the data revenue growth?\n",
            "[00:43:47,670 --> 00:43:52,670]  Or do you think this trend will still continue for another one or two years?\n",
            "[00:43:52,670 --> 00:44:02,670]  And secondly, I think Yvonne just mentioned at the presentation that we actually have done something smart on the cost management front.\n",
            "[00:44:02,670 --> 00:44:07,670]  So this has been one of the key drivers to grow margin as well as the bottom line.\n",
            "[00:44:07,670 --> 00:44:16,670]  So just to remind me, what are exactly the measures we have done in terms of cost management\n",
            "[00:44:16,670 --> 00:44:23,670]  as well as in terms of something slightly differentiated versus all competitors so that we can show a better margin trend overall?\n",
            "[00:44:23,670 --> 00:44:27,600]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:44:28,630 --> 00:44:34,630]  On the mobile data revenue, internally we are looking at at least for the next two years,\n",
            "[00:44:34,630 --> 00:44:40,630]  we will continue to see 1 percent pickup on the smartphone penetration base.\n",
            "[00:44:40,630 --> 00:44:46,630]  Because right now, if you look at our total base, smartphone penetration is roughly 30 percent.\n",
            "[00:44:46,630 --> 00:44:50,630]  So we'll still continue with 1 percent pickup every month.\n",
            "[00:44:50,630 --> 00:44:57,630]  So if you count it like up to after two years, that only reached close to 55 percent.\n",
            "[00:44:57,630 --> 00:45:01,630]  I think that still is quite a reasonable smartphone penetration rate,\n",
            "[00:45:01,630 --> 00:45:07,560]  and I would feel quite comfortable that this trend will continue for the next two years.\n",
            "[00:45:07,560 --> 00:45:09,560]  And Lucy, this is Yvonne.\n",
            "[00:45:09,560 --> 00:45:15,560]  On your second question with regard to cost management, let me give you a few examples.\n",
            "[00:45:15,560 --> 00:45:19,560]  And first example I'm sure you are familiar with, which is iPhone One Year Program,\n",
            "[00:45:19,560 --> 00:45:26,560]  which allows us to essentially cut iPhone versus a standard two-year contract.\n",
            "[00:45:26,560 --> 00:45:31,590]  And second example would be the expansion of our retail store.\n",
            "[00:45:31,590 --> 00:45:39,820]  By having more and more both ads as loyalty being conducted at our own direct store,\n",
            "[00:45:39,820 --> 00:45:47,820]  actually we are saving on the commission that we pay to franchisees or the outside wholesalers.\n",
            "[00:45:47,820 --> 00:45:53,910]  And third thing that we have been doing is that we are building our own backhaul,\n",
            "[00:45:53,910 --> 00:45:55,330]  self-owned backhaul.\n",
            "[00:45:55,330 --> 00:45:59,330]  Backhaul is the fiber-connecting base station to our core network.\n",
            "[00:45:59,330 --> 00:46:05,330]  And previously we were relying on Chunhua for the majority of backhaul.\n",
            "[00:46:05,330 --> 00:46:11,330]  And we have been embarking on the journey to increase our self-owned percentage of backhaul.\n",
            "[00:46:11,330 --> 00:46:19,330]  And that also allows us to cut back on the expense that we pay to Chunhua for renting the backhaul.\n",
            "[00:46:19,330 --> 00:46:21,510]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:46:21,510 --> 00:46:22,510]  Very clear.\n",
            "[00:46:22,510 --> 00:46:24,510]  Can I actually add one more question?\n",
            "[00:46:24,510 --> 00:46:30,510]  So I think you just mentioned, T.Y., you just mentioned that the competition landscape\n",
            "[00:46:30,510 --> 00:46:32,510]  probably is going to heat up a little bit.\n",
            "[00:46:32,510 --> 00:46:34,510]  And we've actually seen that.\n",
            "[00:46:34,510 --> 00:46:44,510]  For example, Chunhua recently also launched a similar like unlimited data plan plus online free call.\n",
            "[00:46:44,510 --> 00:46:47,510]  Some promotion actually you launched a long time ago.\n",
            "[00:46:47,510 --> 00:46:54,510]  But then I just wonder, you know, the reason you probably can maintain your voice revenue quite stable so far\n",
            "[00:46:54,510 --> 00:46:57,510]  is maybe due to such kind of promotion.\n",
            "[00:46:57,510 --> 00:47:07,510]  And do you think, you know, whether your competitors all doing the same will actually impact your future stability of voice revenue?\n",
            "[00:47:07,510 --> 00:47:13,510]  That's why you said that, you know, execution capability probably will slightly be different.\n",
            "[00:47:13,510 --> 00:47:15,930]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:47:15,930 --> 00:47:17,930]  We are monitoring this very closely.\n",
            "[00:47:18,930 --> 00:47:26,930]  But in July up until now, from our retail channel, our momentum continues.\n",
            "[00:47:26,930 --> 00:47:32,930]  So we feel quite comfortable with what we have been able to achieve.\n",
            "[00:47:32,930 --> 00:47:45,470]  And so what I'm telling you is July 1 through now, we have not been impacted by your marketing campaign launched by our competition.\n",
            "[00:47:45,470 --> 00:47:46,470]  Okay.\n",
            "[00:47:46,470 --> 00:47:47,470]  Thank you very much.\n",
            "[00:47:50,100 --> 00:48:00,320]  Please press 01 on your telephone keypad if you would like to ask a question.\n",
            "[00:48:00,320 --> 00:48:08,150]  Please press 01 for questions.\n",
            "[00:48:08,150 --> 00:48:11,150]  The next question is Stephen Liu from Standard Chartered Bank.\n",
            "[00:48:11,150 --> 00:48:12,150]  Please go ahead.\n",
            "[00:48:12,150 --> 00:48:14,020]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:48:14,020 --> 00:48:17,020]  I have a follow-up question on your enterprises business.\n",
            "[00:48:17,020 --> 00:48:21,020]  Any progress on major interest in China markets?\n",
            "[00:48:21,020 --> 00:48:29,020]  I know you are cooperating with China Mobile in the project like wireless city and cloud computing.\n",
            "[00:48:29,020 --> 00:48:39,020]  I mean, any percentage of revenues from ‚Äì what percentage revenue from China, I mean, in the enterprises revenue segment?\n",
            "[00:48:39,020 --> 00:48:42,200]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:48:42,200 --> 00:48:48,200]  Stephen, the revenue contribution from China is still insignificant.\n",
            "[00:48:48,200 --> 00:48:58,200]  So at FET, we see the priority for the next couple of years being Taiwan and being smartphone penetration in Taiwan.\n",
            "[00:48:58,200 --> 00:49:01,200]  So we continue to put effort in China.\n",
            "[00:49:01,200 --> 00:49:09,200]  It's going to be a longer term before we can see sizable revenue and bottom line contribution from China.\n",
            "[00:49:09,200 --> 00:49:10,810]  Okay.\n",
            "[00:49:10,810 --> 00:49:11,810]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:49:11,810 --> 00:49:19,550]  Please press 01 on your telephone keypad for questions.\n",
            "[00:49:19,550 --> 00:49:30,840]  The next question is Cindy Chung from Merlinch.\n",
            "[00:49:30,840 --> 00:49:31,840]  Please go ahead.\n",
            "[00:49:31,840 --> 00:49:33,450]  Hi.\n",
            "[00:49:33,450 --> 00:49:40,450]  I have a question regarding how should we think about the cost of 4G license?\n",
            "[00:49:40,450 --> 00:49:43,450]  Are you willing to pay for the 4G license?\n",
            "[00:49:43,450 --> 00:49:51,450]  And secondly, follow down that is if there's only limited 700 megahertz spectrum,\n",
            "[00:49:51,450 --> 00:49:56,450]  and are you willing to pay as high prices to get it?\n",
            "[00:49:56,450 --> 00:50:00,110]  Thanks.\n",
            "[00:50:00,110 --> 00:50:05,110]  I think going into the 4G is something that we have no choice.\n",
            "[00:50:06,110 --> 00:50:09,110]  It's an evolution path that the parties don't have to participate.\n",
            "[00:50:09,110 --> 00:50:19,220]  As to what will be the price of this license, I have an intelligent answer for you at this stage\n",
            "[00:50:19,220 --> 00:50:26,220]  because the government may say the bottom line for a starting point for a license,\n",
            "[00:50:26,220 --> 00:50:33,220]  and it will also depend on how many players is going to join this auction.\n",
            "[00:50:33,220 --> 00:50:35,220]  So there is a lot of variables.\n",
            "[00:50:35,220 --> 00:50:40,220]  What I can only update you is internally, we have set up a team,\n",
            "[00:50:40,220 --> 00:50:46,220]  and this is quite a complicated model that we have to have a different kind of scenario\n",

            "[00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:06,230]  which is a very nice 10.4% year-on-year growth on the service revenue part.\n",

            "[00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:02,500]  I think the main growth driver is still coming from the mobile data.\n",
            "[00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:05,500]  The mobile data growth continues growing very nicely,\n",
            "[00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:08,500]  and the growth rate continues to expand.\n",
            "[00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:12,500]  In the first quarter, we are reporting a 48% year-on-year growth\n",

            "[00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:30,500]  In terms of the data service subscriber, it's a 63% year-on-year growth,\n",
            "[00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:39,500]  and so far, we are still seeing this growth trend continue without any slowing down signal.\n",
            "[00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:47,940]  On the consolidated financial, our goals are very quickly comparing to first quarter of last year\n",
            "[00:05:47,940 --> 00:05:52,940]  or even comparing to our external forecast that our total revenue,\n",
            "[00:05:52,940 --> 00:05:56,940]  comparing to the same period of last year, is growing by 21%,\n",
            "[00:05:56,940 --> 00:06:03,940]  and we overachieved our financial forecast by 9% in the first quarter.\n",
            "[00:06:03,940 --> 00:06:10,940]  In terms of service revenue, year-on-year growth is more than like 110%,\n",
            "[00:06:10,940 --> 00:06:15,940]  and we also exceed our guidance by 2% on the service revenue.\n",
            "[00:06:15,940 --> 00:06:20,940]  EBITDA line, we are growing year-on-year by 110%,\n",
            "[00:06:20,940 --> 00:06:26,940]  and in terms of the guidance, we are above the guidance by 1%.\n",
            "[00:06:26,940 --> 00:06:32,940]  Coming to the bottom line, the net income, year-on-year growth is close to 24%,\n",
            "[00:06:32,940 --> 00:06:35,940]  and ahead of the guidance by 2%.\n",
            "[00:06:35,940 --> 00:06:46,270]  On the balance sheet, Barisong continues to have the net cash position right now.\n",
            "[00:06:46,270 --> 00:06:54,270]  Our net cash at the end of the first quarter is close to $13 billion,\n",
            "[00:06:54,270 --> 00:06:58,270]  and our free cash flow for the first quarter is $3 billion.\n",
            "[00:06:59,270 --> 00:07:04,270]  So roughly, I think every month is about a billion free cash flow\n",
            "[00:07:04,270 --> 00:07:10,540]  is being generated for the company.\n",
            "[00:07:10,540 --> 00:07:12,540]  Then aside from all this financial,\n",
            "[00:07:12,540 --> 00:07:17,540]  I'll come into for some more business-related updates to all of you,\n",
            "[00:07:17,540 --> 00:07:22,540]  and the first is we would like to update on the smart devices statistic.\n",
            "[00:07:22,540 --> 00:07:26,540]  I think this is the main growth drivers for the top line,\n",
            "[00:07:26,540 --> 00:07:30,540]  and our smartphone penetration rate at the end of first quarter\n",
            "[00:07:30,540 --> 00:07:34,540]  has reached 28% of the total customer base,\n",
            "[00:07:34,540 --> 00:07:38,540]  and in terms of the new device we sold in first quarter,\n",
            "[00:07:38,540 --> 00:07:43,540]  79% is smartphone, which is smartphone plus the tablet.\n",
            "[00:07:43,540 --> 00:07:45,540]  Essentially, it's all the smart devices,\n",
            "[00:07:45,540 --> 00:07:50,600]  and we continue to see that the smartphone penetration rate\n",
            "[00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:55,790]  is growing at least 1% plus per month,\n",
            "[00:07:55,790 --> 00:07:58,790]  and we do not see any slowing trend,\n",
            "[00:07:58,790 --> 00:08:01,790]  and we believe that this trend will continue\n",
            "[00:08:01,790 --> 00:08:05,790]  at least for the next one and a half years.\n",
            "[00:08:05,790 --> 00:08:08,790]  For the R pool, the average smartphone R pool\n",
            "[00:08:08,790 --> 00:08:14,790]  is still maintained very good at 1,500 a month.\n",
            "[00:08:14,790 --> 00:08:19,790]  Essentially, it's double of the feature phone users R pool.\n",
            "[00:08:19,790 --> 00:08:23,790]  Usage has been quite stable for the past quarter.\n",
            "[00:08:23,790 --> 00:08:28,790]  For a smartphone user, the average per month data usage is about one gigabyte,\n",
            "[00:08:28,790 --> 00:08:34,300]  with the tablet usage is around two gigabytes per month.\n",
            "[00:08:34,300 --> 00:08:38,300]  In terms of some of the other business,\n",
            "[00:08:38,300 --> 00:08:44,300]  I would like to take a chance to give you a more detailed elaboration.\n",
            "[00:08:44,300 --> 00:08:48,300]  First, I'll start from all the value-added service.\n",
            "[00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:53,300]  Everybody is trying to create a different revenue source,\n",
            "[00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:55,300]  which is coming from all the apps,\n",
            "[00:08:55,300 --> 00:09:01,300]  and I believe that Barstone continue is leading on the mobile value-added service,\n",
            "[00:09:01,300 --> 00:09:03,300]  both on the breadth and the depth.\n",
            "[00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:09,300]  Here, we are just sharing with you that we have a lot of so-called exclusive\n",
            "[00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:15,300]  and very innovative apps that are currently listed in our application store.\n",
            "[00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:21,300]  This is the one thing that we can build our differentiators with our peers\n",
            "[00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:27,650]  and also create a stickiness as a term management tool.\n",
            "[00:09:27,650 --> 00:09:33,810]  In fact, Baristone has reached a record low turn rate at the end of the first quarter,\n",
            "[00:09:33,810 --> 00:09:38,810]  so I think all this value-added service certainly played an important role\n",
            "[00:09:38,810 --> 00:09:43,030]  in terms of the customer stickiness as well.\n",
            "[00:09:43,030 --> 00:09:49,030]  The next, I think, is also another very important future growth driver for Baristone,\n",
            "[00:09:49,030 --> 00:09:51,260]  and that is the enterprise.\n",
            "[00:09:51,260 --> 00:09:58,260]  Our focus is we are targeting on the SMEs and also some of the big enterprises there,\n",

            "[00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:26,640]  and for the cloud solutions, I think at this stage,\n",
            "[00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:31,640]  we're most focusing on the private cloud for the big enterprises to generate more revenue.\n",

            "[00:12:21,730 --> 00:12:28,730]  We have reached 13%, so it's very likely we probably can outperform this internal target we have set to ourselves.\n",
            "[00:12:29,730 --> 00:12:37,760]  So up to next year, we hope that we can at least achieve 15% market share on the entire enterprise business.\n",

            "[00:23:52,900 --> 00:24:00,900]  Question one was I was wondering if you could talk us through the rationale behind the dividend decision\n",
            "[00:24:00,900 --> 00:24:03,900]  and, you know, the rationale into the future,\n",
            "[00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:07,900]  given the amount of reserves that you've highlighted in previous calls.\n",
            "[00:24:07,900 --> 00:24:12,450]  Question two, around the China Mobile stake acquisition,\n",
            "[00:24:12,450 --> 00:24:14,450]  I'm wondering if you have any update on what's happening\n",
            "[00:24:14,450 --> 00:24:20,450]  and whether that transaction is in any way related to the decision you've made around dividends.\n",
            "[00:24:20,450 --> 00:24:22,800]  Question number three is on operations.\n",
            "[00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:27,800]  I was wondering if you could talk us through the drivers to the improvement\n",
            "[00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:30,800]  that you've seen in the fixed line business margins\n",
            "[00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:32,800]  and whether you believe these are sustainable into the year.\n",
            "[00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:36,050]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:24:36,050 --> 00:24:38,910]  I'll answer the first two questions.\n",
            "[00:24:38,910 --> 00:24:41,910]  The third question, I'll leave it to our CFO, TY, to answer your question.\n",
            "[00:24:41,910 --> 00:24:45,460]  In terms of the dividend policy,\n",
            "[00:24:45,460 --> 00:24:53,490]  I think Barisong has always been trying to have a consistent dividend policy\n",
            "[00:24:53,490 --> 00:24:58,490]  and have a good payoff to the investor.\n",
            "[00:24:58,490 --> 00:25:02,490]  But in the past, because everybody knows that we have the BMCC deal,\n",
            "[00:25:02,490 --> 00:25:06,490]  so there is not much we can do in terms of a dividend.\n",
            "[00:25:06,490 --> 00:25:09,490]  But right now with the government relaxed on the capital surplus\n",
            "[00:25:09,490 --> 00:25:14,490]  so that we are able to have rooms to pay off the future dividends,\n",
            "[00:25:14,490 --> 00:25:21,490]  we have shared with some of the investors that right now in our capital surplus pool,\n",
            "[00:25:21,490 --> 00:25:25,490]  there is about $22 billion that is available for future payout.\n",
            "[00:25:25,490 --> 00:25:29,490]  And in terms of the EPS, it's about $6.8.\n",
            "[00:25:29,490 --> 00:25:35,490]  Of course, Barisong does not intend to pay off this in one shot.\n",
            "[00:25:35,490 --> 00:25:39,490]  So this is, I think, on a year-on-year basis,\n",
            "[00:25:39,490 --> 00:25:45,490]  that Barisong is willing to maintain a stable return for all the investors.\n",
            "[00:25:45,490 --> 00:25:51,490]  So that is the main rationale behind this dividend payout for this year.\n",
            "[00:25:51,490 --> 00:25:57,490]  Regarding your CMCC questions, yes,\n",
            "[00:25:57,490 --> 00:26:02,490]  I think the board just approved that we just do a simple extension\n",
            "[00:26:03,490 --> 00:26:08,490]  of the current deal with CMCC.\n",
            "[00:26:08,490 --> 00:26:15,490]  And both CMCC and Barisong both have the willingness to continue for this deal.\n",
            "[00:26:15,490 --> 00:26:22,490]  However, because the regulatory fund has not granted the permission for this deal,\n",
            "[00:26:22,490 --> 00:26:28,490]  so that the best thing we can do is just do a simple extension\n",
            "[00:26:28,490 --> 00:26:32,490]  and waiting for the future government approval.\n",
            "[00:26:32,490 --> 00:26:36,970]  Regarding your fixed line question, I'll pass it on to TY.\n",
            "[00:26:36,970 --> 00:26:38,970]  Okay. Hey, Alan.\n",
            "[00:26:38,970 --> 00:26:43,970]  With regards to the driver allowing us to improve our fixed line margin,\n",
            "[00:26:43,970 --> 00:26:48,970]  it's primarily the market share growth that you saw on the enterprise side.\n",
            "[00:26:48,970 --> 00:26:56,970]  Specifically, we talked about our enterprise has grown our market share from 12% to roughly 13.5%.\n",
            "[00:26:56,970 --> 00:27:00,970]  So every month, we have landed additional enterprise accounts.\n",
            "[00:27:00,970 --> 00:27:08,970]  And if I look at the kind of the fixed line services whereby we are generating incremental revenue,\n",
            "[00:27:08,970 --> 00:27:10,970]  actually, it's quite broad-based.\n",
            "[00:27:10,970 --> 00:27:15,970]  But specifically, we are seeing increasing revenue from areas such as IBC,\n",
            "[00:27:15,970 --> 00:27:19,970]  such as leased circuits, such as VPN.\n",
            "[00:27:19,970 --> 00:27:26,970]  All these are traced to the new enterprise customers that we have landed recently.\n",
            "[00:27:26,970 --> 00:27:36,970]  And, for example, in the case of IBC, we have seen our occupancy at our IBC locations increase consistently.\n",
            "[00:27:36,970 --> 00:27:40,970]  And as you know, IBC is sort of a fixed cost.\n",
            "[00:27:40,970 --> 00:27:44,970]  So once we land an incremental customer, that is going to give us pretty good revenue\n",
            "[00:27:44,970 --> 00:27:47,970]  as well as good margin improvement.\n",
            "[00:27:47,970 --> 00:27:53,970]  And looking into future, we believe that we'll be able to sustain our fixed line business\n",
            "[00:27:53,970 --> 00:27:58,970]  at a margin somewhere between 20% to 25%.\n",
            "[00:27:58,970 --> 00:28:05,900]  So Q1 is about what we like to achieve longer term.\n",
            "[00:28:05,900 --> 00:28:06,900]  Thank you very much.\n",
            "[00:28:06,900 --> 00:28:14,410]  The next question is Chet Chen from Credit Suite.\n",
            "[00:28:14,410 --> 00:28:16,460]  Please go ahead.\n",
            "[00:28:16,460 --> 00:28:19,460]  Hi. Good afternoon and thank you very much for the call.\n",
            "[00:28:19,460 --> 00:28:21,460]  Congratulations on the result.\n",
            "[00:28:21,460 --> 00:28:24,460]  I have in total five questions.\n",
            "[00:28:24,460 --> 00:28:28,460]  The first question is follow-up on special dividend.\n",
            "[00:28:28,460 --> 00:28:30,460]  Thank you for the earlier clarification.\n",
            "[00:28:30,460 --> 00:28:33,460]  Just want to make sure I understand it right.\n",
            "[00:28:33,460 --> 00:28:37,460]  So how should I view the special dividend?\n",
            "[00:28:37,460 --> 00:28:42,460]  Should I view it as a per share, which is basically 53 cents per share,\n",
            "[00:28:42,460 --> 00:28:44,460]  and that should continue to be stable?\n",
            "[00:28:44,460 --> 00:28:47,460]  Or should I view it as a percentage payout?\n",
            "[00:28:47,460 --> 00:28:55,460]  They should assume maybe that you can maintain 110% payout going forward for quite some time.\n",
            "[00:28:55,460 --> 00:29:04,460]  Is there any possibility for you to consider a payout of maybe $1 or $2 per share for a couple of times\n",
            "[00:29:04,460 --> 00:29:09,460]  in line with what your competitors have done in the past few years?\n",
            "[00:29:09,460 --> 00:29:10,460]  That's the first question.\n",
            "[00:29:10,460 --> 00:29:13,460]  The second question is on the mobile side.\n",
            "[00:29:13,460 --> 00:29:16,460]  The voice revenue seems to be flat year-on-year in the first quarter.\n",
            "[00:29:16,460 --> 00:29:18,460]  Any driver behind that?\n",
            "[00:29:18,460 --> 00:29:23,910]  A follow-up question on the enterprise revenue side as well.\n",
            "[00:29:23,910 --> 00:29:27,910]  You mentioned that the market share, you have gained the market share quite a bit.\n",
            "[00:29:27,910 --> 00:29:32,910]  I'm just wondering if you can share with us the picture of the enterprise market right now.\n",
            "[00:29:32,910 --> 00:29:39,910]  Is it like 80% controlled by Zhonghua Telecom, or is it more fragmented than that?\n",
            "[00:29:39,910 --> 00:29:42,910]  The fourth question is on your guidance.\n",
            "[00:29:42,910 --> 00:29:46,910]  Basically, you are slightly ahead of your guidance in the first quarter.\n",
            "[00:29:46,910 --> 00:29:50,910]  Would you think that you can be ahead of your guidance for the full year,\n",
            "[00:29:50,910 --> 00:29:53,910]  or is there any concerns along the road that you might want to share with us?\n",
            "[00:29:53,910 --> 00:29:54,910]  Thank you very much.\n",
            "[00:29:54,910 --> 00:29:57,070]  Fourth question.\n",
            "[00:29:57,070 --> 00:29:58,070]  Okay.\n",
            "[00:29:58,070 --> 00:30:04,070]  I'll start with the dividend policies and the enterprise side.\n",
            "[00:30:04,070 --> 00:30:08,070]  Regarding the mobile service revenue and our full-year guidance,\n",
            "[00:30:08,070 --> 00:30:11,070]  I'll leave it to our CFO to answer your question.\n",
            "[00:30:12,070 --> 00:30:18,070]  On the special dividend, I think I just mentioned at the end of my sharing with all of you\n",
            "[00:30:18,070 --> 00:30:25,070]  that as far as dividend policy, we are maintaining our dividend policy to be paid out.\n",
            "[00:30:25,070 --> 00:30:34,070]  If there is no major M&A activities down the road, we will at least pay out 100% a year.\n",
            "[00:30:34,070 --> 00:30:41,070]  This is the dividend policy we are setting for ourselves so far.\n",
            "[00:30:41,070 --> 00:30:45,070]  Hopefully, that clarifies your questions.\n",
            "[00:30:45,070 --> 00:30:52,070]  In terms of the enterprise, so far, in terms of the market share,\n",
            "[00:30:52,070 --> 00:30:55,070]  Zhonghua Telecom is still pretty much dominating.\n",
            "[00:30:55,070 --> 00:30:59,070]  There are more than 75% market share so far.\n",
            "[00:30:59,070 --> 00:31:04,070]  The bar zone actually came into the second at 12%.\n",
            "[00:31:04,070 --> 00:31:08,070]  Right now, it's close to 13%.\n",
            "[00:31:08,070 --> 00:31:13,070]  Then, of course, Taobao Mobile is about 2% less than us.\n",
            "[00:31:13,070 --> 00:31:16,070]  Then the remaining, they are the smaller ones.\n",
            "[00:31:16,070 --> 00:31:18,070]  They actually have some pieces.\n",
            "[00:31:18,070 --> 00:31:24,070]  Yes, I think that the major enterprise growth, aside from the new requirements,\n",
            "[00:31:24,070 --> 00:31:28,070]  we are also taking some of the shares from Zhonghua Telecom at this stage.\n",
            "[00:31:28,070 --> 00:31:30,580]  Okay.\n",
            "[00:31:30,580 --> 00:31:36,580]  With regards to your mobile voice revenue question, if you compare you over a year,\n",
            "[00:31:36,580 --> 00:31:42,580]  actually, there was an X value impact, which is mandatory tariff cut.\n",
            "[00:31:42,580 --> 00:31:47,580]  In Taiwan, the mandatory tariff cut was on the 12-month cycle.\n",
            "[00:31:47,580 --> 00:31:51,580]  It begins in April and then ends in the following end of March.\n",
            "[00:31:51,580 --> 00:31:55,580]  If you compare Q1 this year versus last Q1,\n",
            "[00:31:55,580 --> 00:32:00,580]  there was this mandatory tariff cut that we have to consider.\n",
            "[00:32:00,580 --> 00:32:08,740]  Of course, last year, the announced mandatory tariff cut was somewhere about 4%.\n",
            "[00:32:08,740 --> 00:32:15,740]  When it got down onto our revenue line, the impact is significantly lower than that.\n",
            "[00:32:15,740 --> 00:32:23,740]  For the year, we have guided that the mandatory tariff cut is somewhere around $800 million to $900 million.\n",
            "[00:32:23,740 --> 00:32:30,220]  A portion of that is actually reflected in Q1 and primarily in voice.\n",
            "[00:32:30,220 --> 00:32:39,220]  Your last question concerning, given that we are slightly ahead of our guidance in Q1,\n",
            "[00:32:39,220 --> 00:32:42,220]  are we going to be ahead for the whole year?\n",
            "[00:32:43,220 --> 00:32:47,220]  I have to be honest with you that for the whole year, we stick with our guidance.\n",
            "[00:32:47,220 --> 00:32:56,220]  I think what FET wants to do is to establish our track record in terms of delivering on our guidance.\n",
            "[00:32:56,220 --> 00:33:00,220]  Looking out into the future quarters, we are cautiously optimistic.\n",
            "[00:33:00,220 --> 00:33:03,220]  Of course, we continue to see momentum.\n",
            "[00:33:03,220 --> 00:33:07,220]  However, there is always uncertainty that we have to deal with.\n",
            "[00:33:07,220 --> 00:33:11,220]  At this point in time, we stick with our guidance for the year.\n",
            "[00:33:11,220 --> 00:33:19,360]  Okay, thank you.\n",
            "[00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:22,360]  The next question is Mei-Lin from Yuantai. Please go ahead.\n",
            "[00:33:22,360 --> 00:33:26,900]  Hi, thanks for taking my question and congratulations on the great results.\n",
            "[00:33:26,900 --> 00:33:27,900]  I have three questions.\n",
            "[00:33:27,900 --> 00:33:32,900]  First, the first quarter, a minute of usage and our two themes on improving change.\n",
            "[00:33:32,900 --> 00:33:36,900]  Do you think this is mainly driven by the on-net-free call offering\n",
            "[00:33:36,900 --> 00:33:41,900]  or there is also seeing some top-down voice usage pick up in Taiwan market?\n",
            "[00:33:41,900 --> 00:33:44,900]  My second question is about our handset sales mix.\n",
            "[00:33:44,900 --> 00:33:50,900]  In last quarter's earnings poll, we have provided the 2011 high-end, mid-end,\n",
            "[00:33:50,900 --> 00:33:54,900]  and low-end smartphone or we should say handset mix.\n",
            "[00:33:54,900 --> 00:34:00,900]  Do you see any significant change in the first quarter 2012 sales mix for handset side?\n",
            "[00:34:00,900 --> 00:34:02,900]  And the last question is on the regulation side.\n",
            "[00:34:02,900 --> 00:34:06,900]  For the upcoming new discussion on the mandatory tariff cut from NCC,\n",
            "[00:34:06,900 --> 00:34:11,900]  do you have any concern or expectation that the mandatory tariff cut\n",
            "[00:34:11,900 --> 00:34:16,900]  will include also the mobile data from 2013?\n",
            "[00:34:16,900 --> 00:34:18,900]  This is all my questions. Thank you.\n",
            "[00:34:18,900 --> 00:34:26,980]  Okay, regarding the first two, it's more relating to the smartphone mix\n",
            "[00:34:26,980 --> 00:34:31,980]  and also the growth of the traffic and the article related to T-Web.\n",
            "[00:34:31,980 --> 00:34:35,980]  I'll answer the regulatory issue first.\n",
            "[00:34:35,980 --> 00:34:42,980]  So far for this year, I think the tariff cut will start from April 1st as usual\n",
            "[00:34:42,980 --> 00:34:50,980]  and we did not see any sign of the regulatory to actually start to impose the X value\n",
            "[00:34:50,980 --> 00:34:55,980]  on the mobile data side because I think on the data side,\n",
            "[00:34:55,980 --> 00:35:00,980]  the pricing pressure will be more on the fixed broadband.\n",
            "[00:35:00,980 --> 00:35:02,980]  That's what we expect.\n",
            "[00:35:02,980 --> 00:35:08,980]  But on the mobile broadband, so far, we do not see this sign.\n",
            "[00:35:08,980 --> 00:35:15,980]  Of course, I think the regulatory, I think the new NCC will come on board in August.\n",
            "[00:35:15,980 --> 00:35:23,980]  So right now, I think aside from this round of the X value,\n",
            "[00:35:23,980 --> 00:35:28,980]  we need to see, I think, the next term of the commissioners\n",
            "[00:35:28,980 --> 00:35:33,980]  and the new commissioners how will they view the overall pricing situation\n",
            "[00:35:33,980 --> 00:35:37,620]  for the telecom industry in Taiwan.\n",
            "[00:35:37,620 --> 00:35:38,620]  Okay.\n",
            "[00:35:38,620 --> 00:35:43,620]  The first question on the minute of use as well as our pool,\n",
            "[00:35:43,620 --> 00:35:51,620]  actually we don't quite relate those two to the introduction of the on-net-free promotion\n",
            "[00:35:51,620 --> 00:35:54,620]  that we did in the second half of last year.\n",
            "[00:35:54,620 --> 00:36:00,620]  For starter, the on-net-free promotion that we did in the second half of last year,\n",
            "[00:36:01,620 --> 00:36:09,930]  gave us opportunity to gain customers from customers of the two small operators in Taiwan\n",
            "[00:36:09,930 --> 00:36:13,960]  because some of their customers do want to have smart phone\n",
            "[00:36:13,960 --> 00:36:18,960]  and then for those customers, they are likely to migrate to either Chung Hua, FIT, or Taiwan Mobile.\n",
            "[00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:23,960]  And we believe we have been able to get more than our fair share.\n",
            "[00:36:23,960 --> 00:36:27,180]  And secondly, on the minute of use,\n",
            "[00:36:27,180 --> 00:36:33,180]  actually the market as a whole was growing the minute of use to the tune of about 6%.\n",
            "[00:36:33,180 --> 00:36:37,180]  So our minute of use was only slightly ahead of the market.\n",
            "[00:36:37,180 --> 00:36:43,180]  But on the other hand, we can see FIT show a very healthy improvement on the output side.\n",
            "[00:36:43,180 --> 00:36:49,180]  We don't see our revenue diluted by the on-net-free promotion.\n",
            "[00:36:49,180 --> 00:36:52,600]  And your second question on the handset mix,\n",
            "[00:36:52,600 --> 00:36:58,600]  in Q1, indeed, we did see our high-end smart phone percentage go up\n",
            "[00:36:58,600 --> 00:37:05,600]  and that's primarily driven by the introduction of iPhone 4S in the second half of December last year.\n",
            "[00:37:05,600 --> 00:37:09,600]  So for Q1 specifically, our high-end, again,\n",
            "[00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:15,600]  we define high-end as a handset that is costing more than $15,080.\n",
            "[00:37:16,600 --> 00:37:25,980]  The mix was about 60%, higher than the 45% that we saw prior to the introduction of iPhone 4S.\n",
            "[00:37:25,980 --> 00:37:34,080]  But from February to March, we clearly saw the momentum of iPhone 4S come down a little bit.\n",
            "[00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:40,080]  So we would believe it will move to the more normal range going forward.\n",
            "[00:37:42,260 --> 00:37:43,260]  May I follow up?\n",
            "[00:37:43,260 --> 00:37:49,260]  On first quarter, the mid-end and low-end handset sales mix is around what level?\n",
            "[00:37:49,260 --> 00:37:52,360]  Is the high-end 60% for first quarter?\n",
            "[00:37:52,360 --> 00:37:54,360]  25% mid-end.\n",
            "[00:37:54,360 --> 00:37:56,840]  The balance will be low-end.\n",
            "[00:37:56,840 --> 00:37:58,450]  Okay.\n",
            "[00:37:58,450 --> 00:38:00,450]  Okay, thanks very much, T.Y. and Yvonne.\n",
            "[00:38:00,450 --> 00:38:05,140]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:38:05,140 --> 00:38:07,140]  The next question is Stephen Liu from Standard Chart.\n",
            "[00:38:07,140 --> 00:38:09,550]  Please go ahead.\n",
            "[00:38:09,550 --> 00:38:10,550]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:38:10,550 --> 00:38:11,550]  I have two questions.\n",
            "[00:38:11,550 --> 00:38:13,550]  One regarding the CapEx.\n",
            "[00:38:13,550 --> 00:38:25,550]  I noted in your presentation that you have already 90% coverage, I mean the backhaul coverage for your mobile network.\n",
            "[00:38:25,550 --> 00:38:30,550]  And is there any application on the future CapEx outlook?\n",
            "[00:38:30,550 --> 00:38:39,550]  I mean, do you have the room to reduce CapEx given the completion of the backhaul coverage in Taiwan?\n",
            "[00:38:39,550 --> 00:38:49,550]  Second, regarding the mobile network, you mentioned you are going to continue to deploy the second carrier and the third carrier.\n",
            "[00:38:49,550 --> 00:38:51,550]  Can you give me some figures?\n",
            "[00:38:51,550 --> 00:39:00,550]  What percentage base stations have been built the second carrier, and what percentage have been the third carrier?\n",
            "[00:39:00,550 --> 00:39:03,480]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:39:03,480 --> 00:39:04,480]  Okay.\n",
            "[00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:08,480]  In terms of the CapEx, although we continue to build out the cell backhaul,\n",
            "[00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:13,480]  but cell backhaul is not really the biggest chunk of overall the CapEx.\n",
            "[00:39:13,480 --> 00:39:20,480]  So for the CapEx guidance, I think Barstow has been quite consistent that we will continue to maintain 10% to 12%.\n",
            "[00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:25,480]  Our top line will continue to be our CapEx guidance going forward.\n",
            "[00:39:25,480 --> 00:39:32,480]  In terms of the second carrier and the third carrier penetration to our overall base,\n",
            "[00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:40,480]  I think our target by the end of this year is the second carrier will penetrate more than 90% of our total BPS coverage,\n",
            "[00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:43,480]  and the third carrier is close to 50%.\n",
            "[00:39:43,480 --> 00:39:50,010]  So that's our target by the end of this year.\n",
            "[00:39:50,010 --> 00:39:54,490]  Okay, thank you.\n",
            "[00:39:54,490 --> 00:39:59,630]  The next question is Joseph Quinn from Macquarie.\n",
            "[00:39:59,630 --> 00:40:01,820]  Please go ahead.\n",
            "[00:40:01,820 --> 00:40:06,820]  Thank you for the opportunity to ask some questions, and congrats again on the very good results.\n",
            "[00:40:06,820 --> 00:40:09,820]  Can I just ask three hopefully quite straightforward questions?\n",
            "[00:40:09,820 --> 00:40:15,820]  First, on the LTE license front, there obviously has been a lot of discussions in Taiwan on this,\n",
            "[00:40:15,820 --> 00:40:20,820]  and I just want to get your views in terms of how you believe your own spectrum will be managed on this,\n",
            "[00:40:20,820 --> 00:40:24,820]  and also on just timetable that you believe may go forward, i.e.,\n",
            "[00:40:24,820 --> 00:40:30,820]  when do you believe we may get a more firm idea on bidding for an auction process, et cetera?\n",
            "[00:40:30,820 --> 00:40:33,820]  The second question is related to China Mobile.\n",
            "[00:40:33,820 --> 00:40:37,820]  I understand you said that you have renewed the agreement with them.\n",
            "[00:40:37,820 --> 00:40:41,820]  I just wanted to know if there was any changes in the pricing agreement with them,\n",
            "[00:40:41,820 --> 00:40:45,820]  because obviously the pricing is at a much lower price than your current share price.\n",
            "[00:40:45,820 --> 00:40:51,820]  And the second item is that your QP holding at the moment, I believe, is 37%, 38%.\n",
            "[00:40:51,820 --> 00:40:53,820]  With a 12% stake in China Mobile,\n",
            "[00:40:53,820 --> 00:40:58,820]  I believe it's probably going to be difficult to actually transact that deal if you did get approval.\n",
            "[00:40:59,820 --> 00:41:04,820]  And then on the third point, in terms of the electricity rate increases in Taiwan,\n",
            "[00:41:04,820 --> 00:41:06,820]  I just wanted to know if you have any scenario analysis\n",
            "[00:41:06,820 --> 00:41:09,820]  on what you believe the impact would be there on a cost-based basis.\n",
            "[00:41:09,820 --> 00:41:10,820]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:41:11,820 --> 00:41:15,220]  Okay, thanks for your question.\n",
            "[00:41:15,220 --> 00:41:20,220]  Regarding the LTE, I think that the government, the attitude right now is quite clear.\n",
            "[00:41:20,220 --> 00:41:23,220]  I think we expect that by mid of this year,\n",
            "[00:41:23,220 --> 00:41:29,220]  the MOTC is going to announce the table for the spectrum they are going to release,\n",
            "[00:41:29,220 --> 00:41:37,220]  and also I think latest, by mid 2014, they are going to issue all the 4G licenses.\n",
            "[00:41:37,220 --> 00:41:41,220]  So that roughly will be the timeline for the government.\n",
            "[00:41:41,220 --> 00:41:48,220]  And we believe this will be an option process for the 4G license.\n",
            "[00:41:48,220 --> 00:41:54,220]  And in terms of us, and because we also, together with this LTE,\n",
            "[00:41:54,220 --> 00:41:59,220]  also the 2G reforming has come together with this 4G license.\n",
            "[00:41:59,220 --> 00:42:06,220]  Of course, when we are trying to formulate our strategy for how to bid for the spectrum,\n",
            "[00:42:06,220 --> 00:42:10,220]  we will certainly consider the continuity of our services\n",
            "[00:42:10,220 --> 00:42:15,220]  and whether we can launch that 4G service earlier.\n",
            "[00:42:15,220 --> 00:42:20,220]  I think that will be the critical two considerations that we're going to have.\n",
            "[00:42:20,220 --> 00:42:27,250]  And, of course, on the 4G side, the upper band and the low band pair is another technical consideration\n",
            "[00:42:27,250 --> 00:42:31,250]  we will also consider in terms of a bidding strategy.\n",
            "[00:42:31,250 --> 00:42:37,250]  But all this will not be firmed up until, I think, after the second quarter of this year\n",
            "[00:42:37,250 --> 00:42:40,250]  that the government actually announce the table details.\n",
            "[00:42:40,250 --> 00:42:44,250]  Then we will be able to firm up the overall bidding strategy.\n",
            "[00:42:44,250 --> 00:42:45,280]  That's for the LTE.\n",
            "[00:42:45,280 --> 00:42:46,280]  Okay.\n",
            "[00:42:46,280 --> 00:42:48,280]  Can I just follow up quickly on that?\n",
            "[00:42:48,280 --> 00:42:53,280]  In terms of that expectation, then, if they release by 2014,\n",
            "[00:42:53,280 --> 00:42:58,280]  do you expect, then, that the actual auction process itself should happen sometime 2013?\n",
            "[00:42:58,280 --> 00:43:03,630]  I think probably close to.\n",
            "[00:43:03,630 --> 00:43:09,630]  If earlier, I think it will be very late at the end of 2013.\n",
            "[00:43:09,630 --> 00:43:11,940]  Okay.\n",
            "[00:43:11,940 --> 00:43:12,940]  That's fine.\n",
            "[00:43:12,940 --> 00:43:13,940]  Thank you very much.\n",
            "[00:43:13,940 --> 00:43:14,940]  Okay.\n",
            "[00:43:14,940 --> 00:43:17,940]  In terms of CMCC, yes, this is a simple extension.\n",
            "[00:43:18,940 --> 00:43:23,940]  We did not touch on the price per se this round because in that agreement,\n",
            "[00:43:23,940 --> 00:43:28,940]  there was a specific clause that once the deal is being approved by the government,\n",
            "[00:43:28,940 --> 00:43:34,940]  then both parties will renegotiate the price based on whatever the market situation then.\n",
            "[00:43:34,940 --> 00:43:40,940]  So, so far, because there is no sign for the government to approve this deal soon,\n",
            "[00:43:40,940 --> 00:43:46,940]  so our agreement with China Mobile is that this will be a just simple extension\n",
            "[00:43:46,940 --> 00:43:53,940]  and we don't create a lot of effort also on the CMCC front to go through this internal approval process.\n",
            "[00:43:53,940 --> 00:43:56,940]  So that's for the CMCC deal.\n",
            "[00:43:56,940 --> 00:44:02,940]  And you are right, right now, our foreign shareholding has reached 38%.\n",
            "[00:44:02,940 --> 00:44:08,940]  So if the government approves for the deal, of course,\n",
            "[00:44:08,940 --> 00:44:15,940]  it will certainly exceed the direct investment hurdle, which right now is 49%.\n",
            "[00:44:15,940 --> 00:44:23,300]  But I think the whole deal, again, coming back, this is up to government approval\n",
            "[00:44:23,300 --> 00:44:29,300]  and we have not seen a signal that the government will approve this deal.\n",
            "[00:44:30,390 --> 00:44:34,390]  So that's the response regarding to the CMCC.\n",
            "[00:44:34,390 --> 00:44:36,390]  Utility expenses, yes.\n",
            "[00:44:36,390 --> 00:44:40,390]  I think in May that there will be incremental expenses to us\n",
            "[00:44:40,390 --> 00:44:47,390]  and we have quantified the impact to us is about $200 million a year for this year.\n",
            "[00:44:47,390 --> 00:44:55,390]  But so far, we think that that's why our CFO just mentioned that we maintain our four-year guidance.\n",
            "[00:44:55,390 --> 00:45:07,390]  I think internally, we will be able to absorb this incremental utility cost by spending more effectively.\n",
            "[00:45:07,390 --> 00:45:14,390]  So this, I think, is the commitment that the management has made to all investors.\n",
            "[00:45:14,390 --> 00:45:16,450]  Okay, thank you, Yvonne.\n",
            "[00:45:16,450 --> 00:45:17,450]  That's very helpful.\n",
            "[00:45:17,450 --> 00:45:19,450]  So just one last question.\n",
            "[00:45:19,450 --> 00:45:21,450]  I'm just pondering over.\n",
            "[00:45:21,450 --> 00:45:29,450]  In terms of the smartphone, so you've seen the mix come back down to 45% expectation for high-ends now\n",
            "[00:45:29,450 --> 00:45:36,450]  in the second quarter probably going forward, at least until we see some new higher device coming in.\n",
            "[00:45:36,450 --> 00:45:42,540]  How much of an impact should we expect in terms of how EBITDA margin mix change is going forward?\n",
            "[00:45:42,540 --> 00:45:47,540]  We've seen a good improvement coming off February and then into March again.\n",
            "[00:45:47,540 --> 00:45:49,540]  What's your expectations now from there?\n",
            "[00:45:49,540 --> 00:45:56,090]  I think because this is more cycle because right now, even with the other high-end smartphones,\n",
            "[00:45:56,090 --> 00:45:58,090]  the iPhone is still the most expensive.\n",
            "[00:45:58,090 --> 00:46:05,090]  So you can see that without the iPhone that we continue to see because revenue continues to grow.\n",
            "[00:46:05,090 --> 00:46:11,090]  So without iPhone, we are being able to gradually improve our EBITDA margins.\n",
            "[00:46:12,090 --> 00:46:21,090]  I still do not see in the second quarter or so there is enough so-called mix or low-tier handsets.\n",
            "[00:46:21,090 --> 00:46:30,090]  But I think we are also trying to source more, and there will be a couple of very good low-mix smartphones.\n",
            "[00:46:30,090 --> 00:46:37,090]  But I think second quarter down the road, you will see most likely Samsung Galaxy S3 will come into the market.\n",
            "[00:46:37,090 --> 00:46:41,090]  Right now, HTC One X is being sold nicely in the market.\n",
            "[00:46:41,090 --> 00:46:47,090]  But comparing to iPhone, they are still a little bit cheaper than iPhone.\n",
            "[00:46:47,090 --> 00:46:55,090]  So I'm still quite optimistic about the overall EBITDA margin, per se,\n",
            "[00:46:55,090 --> 00:47:04,090]  that you should see a continuously at least maintaining or a slightly improvement on the EBITDA margin percentage.\n",
            "[00:47:05,090 --> 00:47:11,250]  The only cautions I have is depending on the iPhone 5 launch time.\n",
            "[00:47:11,250 --> 00:47:15,250]  Right now, there is a market, a lot of saying on the iPhone 5 launch time.\n",
            "[00:47:15,250 --> 00:47:19,250]  So whether it's in September or November in Taiwan, we don't know.\n",
            "[00:47:19,250 --> 00:47:27,280]  But we only know that when iPhone launch, there will be about two months, two to three months hype on iPhone,\n",
            "[00:47:27,280 --> 00:47:31,280]  which in that particular two, three months, you will certainly impact on the EBITDA margin.\n",
            "[00:47:33,210 --> 00:47:35,210]  Yeah, okay. Yeah, that makes sense.\n",
            "[00:47:35,210 --> 00:47:41,210]  But in terms of the iPhone 5, I guess historically, Taiwan has always been a second launch area.\n",
            "[00:47:41,210 --> 00:47:44,210]  So we won't possibly see it until later this year.\n",
            "[00:47:44,210 --> 00:47:46,210]  Probably close to the end of this year, yeah.\n",
            "[00:47:46,210 --> 00:47:49,210]  Yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay. That's lovely, Yvonne. Thanks very much.\n",
            "[00:47:49,210 --> 00:47:50,210]  Yeah, welcome.\n",
            "[00:47:50,210 --> 00:47:56,990]  The next question is Gary Yu from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\n",
            "[00:47:56,990 --> 00:47:59,990]  Hi, thanks and congratulations on the results.\n",
            "[00:47:59,990 --> 00:48:03,990]  I just have one question regarding your revenue growth trend.\n",
            "[00:48:03,990 --> 00:48:10,990]  If I look at your mobile voice revenue, it has been maintained at almost flat on a year-on-year basis in first quarter.\n",
            "[00:48:10,990 --> 00:48:14,990]  Your data revenue has been growing at 48%.\n",
            "[00:48:14,990 --> 00:48:20,990]  If I look at it on sequential basis going into second quarter, third quarter,\n",
            "[00:48:20,990 --> 00:48:24,990]  should I expect the data revenue trend might continue to accelerate?\n",
            "[00:48:24,990 --> 00:48:30,990]  And in terms of voice revenue, given the tariff reduction in April,\n",
            "[00:48:30,990 --> 00:48:36,990]  do you see the overall voice revenue to go back to declining trend going forward in the next couple of quarters?\n",
            "[00:48:36,990 --> 00:48:39,410]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:48:39,410 --> 00:48:47,410]  Okay. Hey, Gary, for the quarter-to-quarter, we do expect the mobile voice revenue to decline slightly.\n",
            "[00:48:47,410 --> 00:48:53,410]  Of course, we try to grow our customer base and grow our mean of use to mitigate that.\n",
            "[00:48:53,410 --> 00:49:02,410]  But in the grand scheme of things, we do expect a minor reduction from Q1 to Q2 in the mobile voice line.\n",
            "[00:49:02,410 --> 00:49:07,410]  And with regard to data revenue, we believe the momentum will continue,\n",
            "[00:49:07,410 --> 00:49:15,410]  because so far what we are seeing is those customers who come on to the voice plus data revenue packages,\n",
            "[00:49:15,410 --> 00:49:22,630]  the average data package that they are subscribing is actually increasing.\n",
            "[00:49:22,630 --> 00:49:32,940]  So we do expect mobile data revenue to continue the momentum that we have seen over the past few quarters.\n",
            "[00:49:32,940 --> 00:49:37,940]  If I can follow up with a second question regarding your dividend policy,\n",
            "[00:49:37,940 --> 00:49:43,940]  I know Yifong mentioned about the minimum payout ratio of 100%,\n",
            "[00:49:43,940 --> 00:49:49,940]  but obviously you still have undergeared balance sheet with net cash.\n",
            "[00:49:49,940 --> 00:49:52,940]  Your free cash flow is still very strong.\n",
            "[00:49:52,940 --> 00:49:59,940]  And this year in particular, I mean 2011, the payout was high at 110%.\n",
            "[00:49:59,940 --> 00:50:08,940]  So in what kind of scenario do you expect your dividend paid out to be more than 100% in the next couple of years?\n",
            "[00:50:08,940 --> 00:50:14,940]  And if I can make it clear, the 100%, is it going to be a different score going forward\n",
            "[00:50:14,940 --> 00:50:18,940]  or it's going to be the most likely payout ratio? Thank you.\n",
            "[00:50:18,940 --> 00:50:28,300]  Okay. Gary, first of all, I think because every year, I think the dividends need to be approved by the board.\n",
            "[00:50:28,300 --> 00:50:34,300]  So it's very difficult to say very absolute numbers.\n",
            "[00:50:34,300 --> 00:50:38,300]  But I think the general guidance, which is our dividend policy,\n",
            "[00:50:38,300 --> 00:50:47,300]  is going forward at least what I say is at least 100% payout, our total earnings,\n",
            "[00:50:47,300 --> 00:50:50,300]  if there is no major M&A activities.\n",
            "[00:50:50,300 --> 00:50:58,300]  So I think that hopefully it shows that the management's commitment to the shareholder\n",
            "[00:50:58,300 --> 00:51:04,300]  for stable returns to the shareholders.\n",
            "[00:51:04,300 --> 00:51:12,330]  So that's so far that it's being at least set as our dividend policy for now.\n",
            "[00:51:12,330 --> 00:51:16,560]  Okay, thank you.\n",
            "[00:51:16,560 --> 00:51:17,560]  Okay.\n",
            "[00:51:22,880 --> 00:51:25,880]  The next question is Ravi Sarathy from Citi Hong Kong. Please go ahead.\n",
            "[00:51:25,880 --> 00:51:31,620]  Hi, it's Ravi Sarathy, and congratulations on a very strong quarter.\n",
            "[00:51:31,620 --> 00:51:34,620]  And thank you very much for taking my questions.\n",
            "[00:51:34,620 --> 00:51:38,620]  I've got three questions, if I may, which hopefully should be fairly straightforward.\n",
            "[00:51:38,620 --> 00:51:45,620]  The first one is around tablets, you mentioned them in your discussion of the key subscriber trends.\n",
            "[00:51:45,620 --> 00:51:50,620]  I was wondering if you could give us a little bit of color around the total number of tablet additions,\n",
            "[00:51:50,620 --> 00:51:56,620]  including microSIMs for iPads as well as Android tablets that you sell, that you saw in the quarter.\n",
            "[00:51:56,620 --> 00:52:02,620]  My second question is of the entire base of smart devices that you have currently,\n",
            "[00:52:02,620 --> 00:52:06,620]  so not the run rate but the existing smart device on your network,\n",
            "[00:52:06,620 --> 00:52:11,620]  how does the percentage split look between Android and other operating systems?\n",
            "[00:52:11,620 --> 00:52:19,620]  Thirdly, you used to give a breakdown in terms of the percent of your data revenues\n",
            "[00:52:19,620 --> 00:52:26,620]  that comes from the apps ecosystem, from some of the apps you've developed yourself as well as from the app store,\n",
            "[00:52:26,620 --> 00:52:30,620]  30% share that you guys get where your app store is pre-installed,\n",
            "[00:52:30,620 --> 00:52:34,620]  and that came to between 4% and 4.5% of total service revenues.\n",
            "[00:52:34,620 --> 00:52:39,620]  I was wondering if you had any kind of update there or if that should be a follow-up offline.\n",
            "[00:52:39,620 --> 00:52:43,620]  And my final question, and I apologize, there have been a lot of questions about the dividends today.\n",
            "[00:52:43,620 --> 00:52:45,620]  I've got one more to add, if I may.\n",
            "[00:52:46,620 --> 00:52:51,620]  Is there any chance of an extraordinary dividend, in your view,\n",
            "[00:52:51,620 --> 00:53:01,140]  any call around that in addition to the recurring 100% payout ratio dividend going forward?\n",
            "[00:53:01,140 --> 00:53:02,140]  Okay.\n",
            "[00:53:02,140 --> 00:53:06,140]  T.Y. will answer your first three questions and I'll answer the dividend question.\n",
            "[00:53:06,140 --> 00:53:07,140]  Okay, T.Y.\n",
            "[00:53:07,140 --> 00:53:08,140]  Okay.\n",
            "[00:53:08,140 --> 00:53:12,140]  Let me start the one you mentioned the last.\n",
            "[00:53:12,140 --> 00:53:19,260]  Our app and content revenue is about 20% of our mobile data revenue.\n",
            "[00:53:19,260 --> 00:53:20,260]  Thank you very much.\n",
            "[00:53:20,260 --> 00:53:22,260]  That's fantastic.\n",
            "[00:53:22,260 --> 00:53:27,260]  And, again, mobile data revenue is about 27% of our mobile service.\n",
            "[00:53:27,260 --> 00:53:34,260]  And in terms of smart devices, if I just focus on the smartphone,\n",
            "[00:53:34,260 --> 00:53:38,260]  for Android it's actually about 60%, Android.\n",
            "[00:53:38,260 --> 00:53:39,550]  Got it.\n",
            "[00:53:39,550 --> 00:53:42,550]  iPhone is about 25%.\n",
            "[00:53:42,550 --> 00:53:46,550]  And the rest will be Symbian and Windows.\n",
            "[00:53:46,550 --> 00:53:48,550]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:53:48,550 --> 00:53:54,550]  And tablet user increment, I don't want to give you a specific number,\n",
            "[00:53:54,550 --> 00:53:59,550]  but I can share with you this, that prior to Q3 last year,\n",
            "[00:53:59,550 --> 00:54:04,550]  every quarter we sold more netbooks than tablets.\n",
            "[00:54:04,550 --> 00:54:11,550]  But beginning Q3 last year, we started selling more tablets than netbooks.\n",
            "[00:54:12,550 --> 00:54:18,550]  And that ratio continued to tilt toward tablet.\n",
            "[00:54:18,550 --> 00:54:21,550]  In previous quarters, just a little bit of a follow-up on that,\n",
            "[00:54:21,550 --> 00:54:24,550]  in previous quarters the number of tablet ads,\n",
            "[00:54:24,550 --> 00:54:27,550]  including MicroSIMs for iPad that you sold,\n",
            "[00:54:27,550 --> 00:54:35,550]  came to significant double-digit percentages of subscriber additions and even higher.\n",
            "[00:54:35,550 --> 00:54:41,100]  Is that the current theme at the moment or not?\n",
            "[00:54:41,100 --> 00:54:44,100]  That is still the current theme, yes.\n",
            "[00:54:44,100 --> 00:54:48,190]  So probably high teens of sub additions, right?\n",
            "[00:54:48,190 --> 00:54:50,190]  I don't want to give you a specific number.\n",
            "[00:54:50,190 --> 00:54:51,190]  Understood.\n",
            "[00:54:51,190 --> 00:54:52,190]  Thank you very much for the call there.\n",
            "[00:54:52,190 --> 00:54:54,190]  The trend is valid.\n",
            "[00:54:54,190 --> 00:54:56,120]  Okay.\n",
            "[00:54:56,120 --> 00:54:58,120]  Back to the dividend questions.\n",
            "[00:54:58,120 --> 00:55:03,120]  Yes, I think bars always will have room to pay off more than 100%.\n",
            "[00:55:03,120 --> 00:55:10,120]  But on an annual basis, I think that there will be different situations that we may face.\n",
            "[00:55:11,120 --> 00:55:15,120]  We can never 100% predict for the future.\n",
            "[00:55:15,120 --> 00:55:21,120]  So I think at this point of time that our commitment to all the investors is\n",
            "[00:55:21,120 --> 00:55:28,120]  we will increase our dividend payout ratio from the traditional 90% payout,\n",
            "[00:55:28,120 --> 00:55:30,120]  which is set as our dividend policy,\n",
            "[00:55:30,120 --> 00:55:38,120]  and to 100% at least as our new dividend payout policy.\n",
            "[00:55:38,120 --> 00:55:42,120]  But if there is no major M&As or whatever,\n",
            "[00:55:42,120 --> 00:55:50,180]  certainly I think every year this will be subject to a board discussion for dividend payout.\n",
            "[00:55:50,180 --> 00:55:51,180]  Understood.\n",
            "[00:55:51,180 --> 00:55:52,180]  Thank you very much.\n",
            "[00:55:52,180 --> 00:55:53,180]  Okay.\n",
            "[00:55:53,180 --> 00:55:57,340]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:55:57,340 --> 00:56:00,340]  As a reminder, please press 01 for questions.\n",
            "[00:56:00,340 --> 00:56:06,700]  The next question is Chet Chan from Credit Suite.\n",
            "[00:56:06,700 --> 00:56:08,310]  Please go ahead.\n",
            "[00:56:08,310 --> 00:56:09,310]  Hi.\n",
            "[00:56:09,310 --> 00:56:12,310]  Just one follow-up question for me, not about dividend.\n",
            "[00:56:13,310 --> 00:56:22,470]  More of your comment about the potential M&A in the future.\n",
            "[00:56:22,470 --> 00:56:26,470]  I just want to understand your thinking strategically.\n",
            "[00:56:26,470 --> 00:56:30,470]  Is there anything that you might want to add to your portfolio right now?\n",
            "[00:56:30,470 --> 00:56:33,460]  So far, no.\n",
            "[00:56:33,460 --> 00:56:39,880]  So far, there is no so-called big M&A target in the pipeline.\n",
            "[00:56:40,880 --> 00:56:45,880]  But in terms of dividend policy, we always need to be looking forward.\n",
            "[00:56:45,880 --> 00:56:49,880]  But future things, sometimes we don't know.\n",
            "[00:56:49,880 --> 00:56:52,880]  So that's why when we set out a dividend policy,\n",
            "[00:56:52,880 --> 00:56:57,880]  we want to be consistent and we want to be more predictable.\n",
            "[00:56:57,880 --> 00:57:01,880]  So that's why I think we set out this dividend policy.\n",
            "[00:57:01,880 --> 00:57:09,880]  We hope that we have stable returns that continue, that we can provide it to our shareholders.\n",
            "[00:57:09,880 --> 00:57:12,450]  Okay.\n",
            "[00:57:12,450 --> 00:57:13,450]  Thank you very much.\n",
            "[00:57:13,450 --> 00:57:17,620]  Okay.\n",
            "[00:57:17,620 --> 00:57:18,620]  Yeah.\n",
            "[00:57:18,620 --> 00:57:19,620]  Next question is Lucy Liu from J.P. Morgan.\n",
            "[00:57:19,620 --> 00:57:20,620]  Please go ahead.\n",
            "[00:57:20,620 --> 00:57:21,620]  Hi.\n",
            "[00:57:21,620 --> 00:57:22,620]  Thank you very much, Yvonne and TY.\n",
            "[00:57:22,620 --> 00:57:23,620]  I have two questions.\n",
            "[00:57:23,620 --> 00:57:25,620]  One is more on the competition front.\n",
            "[00:57:25,620 --> 00:57:31,620]  So we understand that Viacom used to be the initiator of a lot of good smartphone promotions.\n",
            "[00:57:31,620 --> 00:57:34,620]  And therefore, you guys enjoyed the first move advantage.\n",
            "[00:57:34,620 --> 00:57:40,620]  But nowadays, we see that your competitors are also following the suit by initiating something similar.\n",
            "[00:57:40,620 --> 00:57:45,620]  Even like at Zhonghua, they launched like a one-year iPhone plan earlier this year.\n",
            "[00:57:45,620 --> 00:57:51,620]  So just a wonder, you know, on the competition-wise, so what's the key?\n",
            "[00:57:51,620 --> 00:57:54,620]  Like everybody offering something similar,\n",
            "[00:57:54,620 --> 00:58:01,620]  so what's the key compelling thing you are selling and gaining the market share from your competitors?\n",
            "[00:58:01,620 --> 00:58:06,620]  And also you mentioned earlier that you have some good self-developed applications,\n",
            "[00:58:06,620 --> 00:58:10,620]  which is exclusive and unique for Viacom.\n",
            "[00:58:10,620 --> 00:58:17,620]  Just a wonder how easily your competitor can duplicate or copy something similar in terms of the apps.\n",
            "[00:58:17,620 --> 00:58:23,620]  And the second question is also on 2G refarming and the 4G licensing.\n",
            "[00:58:23,620 --> 00:58:31,620]  So there's some chat among the industry that, you know, when regulators issue the 2G licenses,\n",
            "[00:58:31,620 --> 00:58:38,620]  they probably would not specify like what's the technology to be used with this spectrum.\n",
            "[00:58:38,620 --> 00:58:40,620]  I'm not sure what's the expectation there.\n",
            "[00:58:40,620 --> 00:58:46,620]  And, you know, since you still have like 1 million-ish 2G subscribers,\n",
            "[00:58:46,620 --> 00:58:52,620]  so are you considering to accelerate a migration in the next one or two years?\n",
            "[00:58:52,620 --> 00:58:57,620]  You know, essentially you can use that spectrum also for 4G technology.\n",
            "[00:58:57,620 --> 00:58:58,620]  Thank you.\n",
            "[00:58:58,620 --> 00:58:59,620]  Okay.\n",
            "[00:58:59,620 --> 00:59:07,620]  I think that we are, in fact, also, in fact, we are leading some of the new rate plans\n",
            "[00:59:07,620 --> 00:59:11,620]  or some of the smartphone sales.\n",
            "[00:59:11,620 --> 00:59:17,620]  And, of course, we do expect that the operators will follow if that makes sense to them.\n",
            "[00:59:17,620 --> 00:59:21,620]  But down the road, I think that we'll continue to have new things coming out\n",
            "[00:59:21,620 --> 00:59:25,620]  and also a lot of things will depend on the good executions.\n",
            "[00:59:25,620 --> 00:59:30,620]  And so far, even like our competitor, Zhonghua, is the least one to launch.\n",
            "[00:59:30,620 --> 00:59:34,620]  For example, Zhonghua is the last one to launch this one-year iPhone program.\n",
            "[00:59:34,620 --> 00:59:40,620]  And Boris Tung is the head of Telemobile like for about two, three months.\n",
            "[00:59:40,620 --> 00:59:46,620]  But I think our iPhone one-year program take-up rate is the highest in the market.\n",
            "[00:59:46,620 --> 00:59:50,620]  So it's really a lot of things depending on the executional front.\n",
            "[00:59:50,620 --> 00:59:53,620]  So I'm not too worried about that one.\n",
            "[00:59:53,620 --> 01:00:02,620]  In terms of the app, I think for our unique app, it will be difficult to be copied\n",
            "[01:00:02,620 --> 01:00:07,620]  because it is our exclusive and we have a special interface,\n",
            "[01:00:07,620 --> 01:00:11,620]  particularly some of it also linked with our group resources.\n",
            "[01:00:11,620 --> 01:00:17,620]  I think that will be highly difficult for our competitors to actually copy and follow.\n",
            "[01:00:17,620 --> 01:00:22,620]  So if you look through all the application stores in Taiwan,\n",
            "[01:00:22,620 --> 01:00:27,620]  the operators, whatever, our own smart, our own part,\n",
            "[01:00:27,620 --> 01:00:35,620]  that Boris Tung actually has the most exclusive and unique applications.\n",
            "[01:00:35,620 --> 01:00:42,620]  I think that's also because Boris Tung, that we continue to invest in this innovative field.\n",
            "[01:00:43,620 --> 01:00:49,620]  But also one thing I would like to mention, all these apps or whatever, it's a continuous thing.\n",
            "[01:00:49,620 --> 01:00:53,620]  We just need to continue to have new things coming out on the board\n",
            "[01:00:53,620 --> 01:00:58,620]  and maintaining our leading edge on this area.\n",
            "[01:00:58,620 --> 01:01:03,620]  So we'll be never afraid of our competitors catching up in this area.\n",
            "[01:01:03,620 --> 01:01:08,620]  So that's regarding your two questions regarding whether we can continue\n",
            "[01:01:08,620 --> 01:01:14,620]  to maintain our competitive edge comparing to our competitors.\n",
            "[01:01:14,620 --> 01:01:19,620]  Your last question is regarding the 4G license.\n",
            "[01:01:19,620 --> 01:01:26,620]  So far at this stage, we do not have a so-called aggressive plan to actually move the people\n",
            "[01:01:26,620 --> 01:01:32,620]  from the current whatever the GSM network and on to eventually the 4G.\n",
            "[01:01:32,620 --> 01:01:39,620]  But I think there will be a natural evolution because you don't see much GSM phones,\n",
            "[01:01:39,620 --> 01:01:42,620]  new phones being sold in Taiwan now.\n",
            "[01:01:42,620 --> 01:01:46,620]  So I think essentially customers will migrate on to the new network.\n",
            "[01:01:46,620 --> 01:01:50,620]  And you are right that the government, when they issue the 4G license,\n",
            "[01:01:50,620 --> 01:01:56,620]  most likely they will not specify the technology to be deployed on that particular spectrum.\n",
            "[01:01:57,620 --> 01:02:03,620]  And internally, we are discussing that we will only maintain the minimum spectrum\n",
            "[01:02:03,620 --> 01:02:08,620]  that probably will retain for our voice-centric, which is traditional 2G users,\n",
            "[01:02:08,620 --> 01:02:10,620]  to continue our services.\n",
            "[01:02:10,620 --> 01:02:19,620]  And the remaining part will be most likely utilized by the 4G users.\n",
            "[01:02:19,620 --> 01:02:24,620]  So that is a very initial and preliminary plan at this stage.\n",
            "[01:02:24,620 --> 01:02:28,620]  And as I said, we will be firming up all the strategies\n",
            "[01:02:28,620 --> 01:02:33,970]  until we know exactly what the game rules from the government.\n",
            "[01:02:33,970 --> 01:02:38,600]  Yes, thank you very much.\n",
            "[01:02:38,600 --> 01:02:40,600]  The next question is Stephen Liu from CenterChart.\n",
            "[01:02:40,600 --> 01:02:41,600]  Please go ahead.\n",
            "[01:02:41,600 --> 01:02:42,600]  Thank you.\n",
            "[01:02:42,600 --> 01:02:44,600]  I have a follow-up question on the Wi-Fi.\n",
            "[01:02:44,600 --> 01:02:49,600]  I understand you are building a lot of Wi-Fi hotspots in the convenience stores.\n",
            "[01:02:49,600 --> 01:02:52,600]  How many Wi-Fi hotspots do you have?\n",
            "[01:02:52,600 --> 01:02:55,600]  And how many are owned by yourself?\n",
            "[01:02:55,600 --> 01:02:59,600]  And how many are built together with other companies?\n",
            "[01:02:59,600 --> 01:03:07,600]  And how much of the data traffic was offloaded by the Wi-Fi on your network?\n",
            "[01:03:07,600 --> 01:03:10,270]  Thank you.\n",
            "[01:03:10,270 --> 01:03:16,300]  Right now, we have around 15,000 Wi-Fi hotspots.\n",
            "[01:03:16,300 --> 01:03:21,720]  And our target is by the end of this year, we will reach 20,000.\n",
            "[01:03:22,720 --> 01:03:29,650]  All this Wi-Fi hotspot is owned by us or our subsidiary.\n",
            "[01:03:29,650 --> 01:03:34,650]  So there is no other company that is owning this Wi-Fi hotspot.\n",
            "[01:03:34,650 --> 01:03:39,650]  And so far, we do see some increase in offload,\n",
            "[01:03:39,650 --> 01:03:44,650]  but right now the offload percentage is less than 5%,\n",
            "[01:03:44,650 --> 01:03:46,940]  so it's still not very significant.\n",
            "[01:03:46,940 --> 01:03:48,940]  Okay, thank you.\n",
            "[01:03:48,940 --> 01:03:59,530]  As a reminder, please press 01 for questions.\n",
            "[01:03:59,530 --> 01:04:02,530]  As a reminder, please press 01 for questions.\n",
            "[01:04:02,530 --> 01:04:06,480]  There are currently no questions.\n",
            "[01:04:06,480 --> 01:04:09,900]  I will pass back to Gary for further comments.\n",
            "[01:04:09,900 --> 01:04:13,900]  Okay, thank you, everybody, again, to attend our conference call.\n",
            "[01:04:13,900 --> 01:04:20,410]  And I understand it's Friday night, so let's end this right now.\n",
            "[01:04:20,410 --> 01:04:22,410]  So, okay, have a great time back here.\n",
            "[01:04:22,410 --> 01:04:24,440]  Thank you very much.\n",
            "[01:04:24,440 --> 01:04:25,440]  Bye-bye.\n",
